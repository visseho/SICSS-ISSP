  abstract = {We consider learning in a Markov decision process where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be difficult to write down an explicit reward function specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover the expert's reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward function.},

We hypothesize that reporting discrepancies should be most prevalent for marginal workers and for marginal or nonstandard jobs, and we find systematic associations between the incidence of reporting discrepancies and observable person and job characteristics that are consistent with this hypothesis. The paper discusses the implications of the reported findings for both micro and macro labor market analysis.}

The method- ological approach is comparable with common bibliometric analyses of the ISI citation databases.

  abstract = {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TextRunner, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TextRunner with KnowItAll, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TextRunner achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KnowItAll to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TextRunner extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TextRunner's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},

Our method finds significant {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}-grams related to a topic, which are then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution. Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression for what a topic is "about." Our approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method outperforms the more standard use of {\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash} and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news articles.},

They have many variants such as NMF, PLSI and LDA, and are used in many fields such as genetics, text and the web, image analysis and recommender systems. However, only recently have reasonable methods for estimating the likelihood of unseen documents, for instance to perform testing or model comparison, become available. This paper explores a number of such methods, improving on the recent Left-to-Right algorithm of Wallach.}

Cognates have at least 4 essential properties: 1) they are always structural units; 2) they are words; 3) words paired may be but need not be semantically identical; 4) there is always some kind of formal resemblance between cognates. I argue that these properties can be explained in terms of a particular model of lexical activation and word recognition, namely the Cohort Model. I also take up the question of defining cognates for psycho linguistic purposes and argue against using traditional extensional definitions based on etymology and genetic relatedness. I argue for defining cognates in terms of their structural representations and the processes which activate and select them.}

  journal = {AI Magazine},
  volume = {22},
  abstract = {How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in its interface, and how do we decide how the interface represents information about the world and about its own workings to a user? This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.}

A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Current research on the influence of electronic communication technologies such as electronic mail, World Wide Web, electronic journals, bibliographic databases and on-line card catalogs suggest that they broaden academic research communities and change the ways researchers work. However, it is less well-understood how these changes take place. One explanation is that the mechanism for change is generational: doctoral students transform research disciplines as they apply new electronic communication skills they ?grew up with.? This article examines this explanation and related claims through evidence from a study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although all the doctoral students used electronic communication technologies in various ways, their work practices reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in their disciplines. Students used electronic communication to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3) enhance the social connections and material resources their advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or improve ?hands-on? research techniques (textual analysis, wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their advisor or research group delegated to them.}

Whether and where this distinction is represented at the neural level is still a matter of considerable debate. In the present fMRI study, we examined the neural correlates of syntactic and semantic functions using an innovative activation paradigm specifically designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing. Our findings strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars opercularis) is critically implicated in processing syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of a sentence.}

  abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.}

  abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA.},

We use this fact to build a model of media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even though it can make all market participants worse off. The model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers receive independent evidence on the true state of the world, and that competition between independently owned news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.}

These dialogue policies are designed for negotiation against users of different cultural norms (individualists, collectivists, and altruists). In order to learn these policies we build simulated users (SUs), i.e. models that simulate the behavior of real users, and use reinforcement learning (RL). The SUs are trained on a spoken dialogue corpus in a negotiation domain, and then tweaked towards a particular cultural norm using hand-crafted rules. We evaluate the learned policies in a simulation setting. Our results are consistent with our SUs, in other words, the policies learn what they are designed to learn, which shows that RL is a promising technique for learning policies in domains, such as argumentation, that are more complex than standard slot-filling applications.}

Why is teenage smoking out of control, when everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point. {$<$}P{$>$}In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move the world."},

A checkup revealed that his blood vessels were clogged with arterial plaque. Within two days he had a triple bypass.

  volume = {1},

  abstract = {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a powerful method of inductive inference, the basis of statistical modeling, pattern recognition, and machine learning. It holds that the best explanation, given a limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are particularly well-suited for dealing with model selection, prediction, and estimation problems in situations where the models under consideration can be arbitrarily complex, and overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive, step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a comprehensive reference (with an emphasis on conceptual issues) that is accessible to graduate students and researchers in statistics, pattern classification, machine learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other applied sciences that involve model selection, including biology, econometrics, and experimental psychology. Part I provides a basic introduction to MDL and an overview of the concepts in statistics and information theory needed to understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding, the information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and part III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory of inductive inference based on universal coding. Part IV provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical theory of exponential families with an emphasis on their information-theoretic properties. The text includes a number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a \&quot;fast track\&quot; through the material, and boxes highlighting the most important concepts.},

Subtracting these values at successive points gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive load.},

The solution is to make all articles open access (OA, i.e., accessible online, free for all). OA articles have significantly higher citation impact than non-OA articles. There are two roads to OA: the ?golden? road (publish your article in an OA journal) and the ?green? road (publish your article in a non-OA journal but also self-archive it in an OA archive). About 10\% of journals are gold, but over 90\% are already green (i.e., they have given their authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about 10?20\% of articles have been self-archived. To reach 100\% OA, self-archiving needs to be mandated by researchers? employers and funders, as they are now increasingly beginning to do.},

Our algorithm constructs policies incrementally, starting from a policy which makes no use of the available information. The incremental process constructs policies which includes more of the information available to the decision maker at each step. While the process converges to the optimal policy, our approach is designed for situations in which computing the optimal policy is infeasible. We provide examples of the process on several large decision problems, showing that, for these examples, the process constructs valuable (but sub-optimal) policies before the optimal policy would be available by traditional methods. 1},
  keywords = {classifier,decision-making,decision-tree,uncertainty},
  note = {When costs of computation are not taken into account, optimal policies can be determined using dynamic programming [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986]. When the costs of computation are not negligible, the cost of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which can be used to compute policies for large multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty represented as influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental, and uses abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and Matheson, 1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs, preferences, and available actions from the perspective of a single decision maker. A decision tree represents a decision function. The single stage information refinement algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence diagram with a single decision node. A policy is represented by a collection of decision trees, one for each decision node in the influence diagram. A deterministic decision tree is an inappropriate representation for a decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being refined. For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement may have ramifications for the global policy. Neither of these complications occur for single-stage problems.}

Partitional clustering algorithms have been recognized to be more suitable as opposed to the hierarchical clustering schemes for processing large datasets. A wide variety of distance functions and similarity measures have been used for clustering, such as squared Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and relative entropy. In this paper, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of these measures in partitional clustering for text document datasets. Our experiments utilize the standard K-means algorithm and we report results on seven text document datasets and five distance/similarity measures that have been most commonly used in text clustering.},

  abstract = {The most basic assumption used in statistical learning theory is that training data and test data are drawn from the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, in many applications, the "in-domain" test data is drawn from a distribution that is related, but not identical, to the "out-of-domain" distribution of the training data. We consider the common case in which labeled out-of-domain data is plentiful, but labeled in-domain data is scarce. We introduce a statistical formulation of this problem in terms of a simple mixture model and present an instantiation of this framework to maximum entropy classifiers and their linear chain counterparts. We present efficient inference algorithms for this special case based on the technique of conditional expectation maximization. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to improved performance on three real world tasks on four different data sets from the natural language processing domain.},

In this research, we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on intercultural negotiation processes and outcomes, controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive ability and emotional intelligence), personality (openness and extraversion), and international experience. Transcripts of 124 American and East Asian negotiators were coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors and cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a week prior to negotiations predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative information behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit, over and beyond other individual differences. Additional analyses revealed that the level of integrative sequencing was more a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring negotiator within the dyad. Other individual difference characteristics were not related to effective intercultural negotiation processes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

A total of 2,005 sentences from 28 prepared testimonies presented before hearings on Net neutrality were manually annotated for one or more of ten human values using an annotation frame based on experience annotating similar content using the Schwartz Values Inventory. Moderately good agreement suggests that meaningful distinctions can often be drawn by human annotators. Several k-Nearest-Neighbor classifiers were compared in this preliminary study, yielding results that appear promising and that clearly point to productive directions for future work.}

We discuss the implementation and extension of ISO-TimeML for annotating a corpus of clinical notes, known as the THYME corpus. To reflect the information task and the heavily inference-based reasoning demands in the domain, a new annotation guideline has been developed, ``the THYME Guidelines to ISO-TimeML (THYME-TimeML)''. To clarify what relations merit annotation, we distinguish between linguistically-derived and inferentially-derived temporal orderings in the text. We also apply a top performing TempEval 2013 system against this new resource to measure the difficulty of adapting systems to the clinical domain. The corpus is available to the community and has been proposed for use in a SemEval 2015 task.}

  abstract = {Topic models have been studied extensively in the context of monolingual corpora. Though there are some attempts to mine topical structure from cross-lingual corpora, they require clues about document alignments. In this paper we present a generative model called JointLDA which uses a bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an unaligned corpus. Experiments conducted on different data sets confirm our conjecture that jointly modeling the cross-lingual corpora offers several advantages compared to individual monolingual models. Since the JointLDA model merges related topics in different languages into a single multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively fewer topics. b) it has the ability to predict related words from a language different than that of the given document. In fact it has better predictive power compared to the bag-of-word based translation model leaving the possibility for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word model for cross-lingual IR applications. We also found that the monolingual models learnt while optimizing the cross-lingual copora are more effective than the corresponding LDA models.},

  abstract = {The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input--are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.},

The LMMG can be used to summarize the network structure, to predict links between the nodes, and to predict missing features of a node. We derive efficient inference and learning algorithms and evaluate the predictive performance of the LMMG on several social and document network datasets.},

Additional timing observations indicate that this pulsar is likely a disrupted recycled pulsar. PSR J2007+2722's pulse profile is remarkably wide with emission over almost the entire spin period; the pulsar likely has closely aligned magnetic and spin axes. The massive computing power provided by volunteers should enable many more such discoveries.}

This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.},

The player consists of a questionanswering module and a decision-making module. The question-answering module utilizes question transformation techniques, natural language parsing, multiple information retrieval algorithms, and multiple search engines; results are combined in the spirit of ensemble learning using an adaptive weighting scheme. Empirically, the system correctly answers about 75\% of questions from the Millionaire CD-ROM, 3rd editiongeneral-interest trivia questions often about popular culture and common knowledge. The decision-making module chooses from allowable actions in the game in order to maximize expected risk-adjusted winnings, where the estimated probability of answering correctly is a function of past performance and confidence in correctly answering the current question. When given a six question head start (i.e., when starting from the \$2,000 level), we find that the system performs about as well on average as humans starting at the beginning. Our system demonstrates the potential of simple but well-chosen techniques for mining answers from unstructured information such as the web.}

  abstract = {Most techniques for relating textual information rely on intellectually created links such as author-chosen keywords and titles, authority indexing terms, or bibliographic citations. Similarity of the semantic content of whole documents, rather than just titles, abstracts, or overlap of keywords, offers an attractive alternative. Latent semantic analysis provides an effective dimension reduction method for the purpose that reflects synonymy and the sense of arbitrary word combinations. However, latent semantic analysis correlations with human text-to-text similarity judgments are often empirically highest at {$\approx$}300 dimensions. Thus, two- or three-dimensional visualizations are severely limited in what they can show, and the first and/or second automatically discovered principal component, or any three such for that matter, rarely capture all of the relations that might be of interest. It is our conjecture that linguistic meaning is intrinsically and irreducibly very high dimensional. Thus, some method to explore a high dimensional similarity space is needed. But the 2.7 {\texttimes} 107 projections and infinite rotations of, for example, a 300-dimensional pattern are impossible to examine. We suggest, however, that the use of a high dimensional dynamic viewer with an effective projection pursuit routine and user control, coupled with the exquisite abilities of the human visual system to extract information about objects and from moving patterns, can often succeed in discovering multiple revealing views that are missed by current computational algorithms. We show some examples of the use of latent semantic analysis to support such visualizations and offer views on future needs.},

Pragmatic purposes abound, including selling goods and services, winning political campaigns, and identifying possible terrorists. Yet 'big data' can also be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use big data to do research that improves the lives of human beings, improves government services, and reduces taxpayer costs. In order to achieve this goal, researchers must have access to this data - raising important privacy questions. What are the ethical and legal requirements? What are the rules of engagement? What are the best ways to provide access while also protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss? The goal of this book is to answer some of these questions. The book's authors paint an intellectual landscape that includes legal, economic, and statistical frameworks. The authors also identify new practical approaches that simultaneously maximize the utility of data access while minimizing information risk.},

Overall, the volunteers enjoyed the spoiled stories more than the unspoiled stories; therefore, spoilers may actually increase suspense instead of decreasing it.},

  abstract = {The standard interpretation of the logical operators in a Boolean retrieval system is in general too strict. A standard Boolean query rarely comes close to retrieving all and only those documents which are relevant to the user. An AND query is often too narrow and an OR query is often too broad. The choice of the AND results in retrieving on the left end of a typical average recall-precision graph, while the choice of the OR results in retrieving on the right end, implying a tradeoff between precision and recall. This study basically examines various proposed schemes, the P-norm, Classical Fuzzy-Set, MMM, Paice and TIRS, which provide means to soften the interpretation of the logical operators, and thus to attain both high precision and high recall search performance. Each of the above schemes has shown great improvement over the standard Boolean scheme in terms of retrieval effectiveness. The differences in retrieval effectiveness between P-norm, Paice and MMM are shown to be relatively small. However, related performance results obtained gives evidence of the ranking: P-norm, Paice, MMM and then TIRS.}

  abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

Conditional random fields model the probability P(t{\textbar}o) of a tag sequence given an observation sequence directly and have previously been employed successfully for other tagging tasks. The mechanics of CRFs and their relationship to maximum entropy are discussed in detail.RESULTS:We employ a diverse feature set containing standard orthographic features combined with expert features in the form of gene and biological term lexicons to achieve a precision of 86.4 and recall of 78.7\%. An analysis of the contribution of the various features of the model is provided.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering \{{\textbackslash}cal C{\textbackslash} to clustering \{{\textbackslash}cal C'{\textbackslash}. The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings. Keywords: Clustering; Comparing partitions; Measures of agreement; Information theory; Mutual information\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {There is a very real sense that in the aftermath of the limited success of the development paradigm (recipe) of the Washington consensus based on the pillars of liberalization, privatization and deregulation, new and challenging thinking and analysis need to be brought to bear on the problems faced by developing countries. While sound macro policies and low inflation are undoubtedly important precursors to self sustainable growth, they are not in themselves sufficient to deliver development. We argue that if development is a matter of self transformation arising from within an economy, then innovation must play a central role in the process and so to must the capacity for an economy to develop, integrate and adapt to novelty. This is at the core of the concept of self sustaining development and indeed why development is an emergent phenomenon. Thus the key questions for policy makers are: How can a transformation of innovation performance be achieved in a competitive international economy? What are the appropriate policy instruments? What role is there for universities? What stimuli can be given to entrepreneurial action? We explore these in terms of a critical evaluation of the idea of innovation systems and of the nature of innovation policy appropriate to innovation based development.},

Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be.}

The superordinate relation (hyponymy) generates a hierarchical semantic organization that is duplicated in the noun files by the use of labeled pointers between sets of synonyms (synsets). The hierarchy is limited in depth, seldom exceeding more than a dozen levels. Distinguishing features are entered in such a way as to create a lexical inheritance system, a system in which each word inherits the distinguishing features of all its superordinates. Three types of distinguishing features are discussed: attributes (modification), parts (meronymy) and functions (predication), but only meronymy is presently implemented in the noun files. Antonymy is also found between nouns, but it is not a fundamental organizing principle for nouns. Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical files, each of which deals with a different primitive semantic component. Characteristics of each topic are discussed.}

To enable researchers to easily gain understanding of a biomedical concept, a biomedical Semantic Web that seamlessly integrates knowledge from biomedical ontologies, publications and patents would be very helpful. In this paper, current research efforts in representing biomedical knowledge in Semantic Web languages are surveyed. Techniques are presented for information retrieval and knowledge discovery from the Semantic Web that extend traditional keyword search and database querying techniques. Finally, some of the challenges that have to be addressed to make the vision of a biomedical Semantic Web a reality are discussed.}

  abstract = {Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents. When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reflect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data.}

The extracted ?universal? topics have multiple types of representations, with each type corresponding to one language. Accordingly, new documents of different languages can be represented in a space using a group of universal topics, which makes various multilingual Web applications feasible.}

We will limit our attention to systems for dependency parsing in a narrow sense, i.e. systems where the analysis assigned to an input sentence takes the form of a dependency structure. This means that we will not discuss systems that exploit dependency relations for the construction of another type of representation, such as the head-driven parsing models of Collins (1997, 1999). Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to systems for full parsing, which means that we will not deal with systems that produce a partial or underspecified representation of dependency structure, such as Constraint Grammar parsers (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995).},

  abstract = {10.1518/001872006776412180 Objective: The present study examined the relationship between two distinct subfactors of spatial ability and performance in an information search task modeled on browsing the Web. Background: Previous studies have found relationships between various measures of spatial ability and performance in a wide variety of computerbased tasks. Method: In the search task 101 participants (18-29 years of age) searched for the answer to a question by navigating the system. They completed the experimental task as well as a battery of cognitive ability measures that included two different measures of spatial ability. Results: The results indicate that spatial orientation ability was related to performance with tasks that were high in their navigational requirement (engendered by the use of a novel aid), whereas spatial visualization was unrelated to performance in any task condition. Conclusion: A closer inspection of the cognitive requirements of a task may reveal what interventions could be most useful when designing computer systems or developing training programs. Application: Given the unique differences between the different spatial abilities, the current results suggest the design of navigational aids that place less demand on spatial orientation ability.

  abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest to anyone with sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look at general challenges and discusses categorization, extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the broader implications that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services have: questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation and whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in opinion-oriented information-seeking systems.},

Text analysis of these narratives, focusing on specific words or classes of words, has been used in numerous research studies including studies of emotional, cognitive, structural and process components of individuals' verbal and written language. It was in this research context that the LIWC program was developed. The program analyzes text files on a word-by-word basis, calculating percentage words that match each of several language dimensions. Its output is a text file that can be opened in any of a variety of applications, including word processors and spreadsheet programs. The program has 68 pre-set dimensions (output variables) including linguistic dimensions, word categories tapping psychological constructs and personal concern categories and can accommodate user-defined dimensions as well. Easy to install and use, this software offers researchers in social, personality, clinical and applied psychology a valuable tool for quantifying the rich but often slippery data provided in the form of personal narratives. The software comes complete on one diskette and runs on any Windows-based computer.},

The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single parameter {\th}eta, introduced by Kingman, is {\textbackslash}mathsfPD(0, {\th}eta). Known properties of {\textbackslash}mathsfPD(0, {\th}eta), including the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random permutation of {\textbackslash}mathsfPD({\textbackslash}alpha, {\th}eta) is a simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For 0 {$<$} {\textbackslash}alpha {$<$} 1, {\textbackslash}mathsfPD({\textbackslash}alpha, 0) is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index {$\alpha$}. Formulae in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is {\textbackslash}mathsfPD(1/2, 0) and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bredge is {\textbackslash}mathsfPD(1/2, 1/2). The {\textbackslash}mathsfPD({\textbackslash}alpha, 0) and {\textbackslash}mathsfPD({\textbackslash}alpha, {\textbackslash}alpha) distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index {$\alpha$}.},

The theory also postulates a structure of relations among the value types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based on the theory and suitable for cross-cultural research, is described. Evidence relevant for assessing the theory, from 97 samples in 44 countries, is summarized. Relations of this approach to Rokeach's work on values and to other theories and research on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified in the domains of politics and intergroup relations.},

  abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer labeled training instances if it is allowed to choose the training data from which is learns. An active learner may ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of several problem setting variants, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

  abstract = {Using a sentiment score provided by Thomson Reuters to measure the tone of news articles, this paper examines monthly portfolio returns constructed from information about past news articles. The sentiment score is obtained from the kind of words and phrases that are used in the news article. Positive tone in news articles in the past months predicts positive returns. Similarly, negative tone in the past months predicts negative returns. Past sentiment predicts future returns even for large stocks. The predictive ability of past sentiment dominates the predictive ability of past returns. After controlling for past sentiment, the predictive ability of past returns (in predicting future return) disappears. The findings are robust to multiple specifications. The predictive ability of past sentiment can be used profitably. When applied to the largest decile of stocks, a strategy that takes a long position in stocks with past positive sentiment score and a short position in stocks with past negative sentiment score generates a statistically significant alpha of 34 basis points per month. The resulting portfolio is also positively correlated with a long-short momentum portfolio. Within the same time period, a trading strategy using the sentiment scores from the subset of news articles citing analysts is not profitable. The news items that cite analysts have economically significant contemporaneous returns. The findings suggest that (i) the market underreacts to information contained in news articles, (ii) momentum might be related to underreaction to the sentiment information, and (iii) market participants pay attention to sentiment score information in analyst news. The findings are consistent with a model where one trader has private information and others are trading based on past returns and volume information.}

Dirichlet mixture densities are designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies to form estimates of expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden Markov model or other statistical model. These estimates give a statistical model greater generalization capacity, so that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the model. This paper corrects the previously published formula for estimating these expected probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step for text mining the biomedical literature. Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus. The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names. We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition. RESULTS: To ensure heterogeneity of the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term similarity to documents with known gene names and 10K high- and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger and the results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true meaning in the sentence context. Application of these constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial matching. CONCLUSION: The annotation of GENETAG required intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into words, to provide indices supporting comparison of system responses to the "gold standard". However, character-based indices would have been more robust than word-based indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1 data and ancillary programs are freely available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz. A newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this year.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to lay out a methodology and corresponding computer algorithms, that allow us to extract the detailed data on inventors contained in patents, and harness it for economic research. Patent data has long been used in empirical research in economics, and yet the information on the identity (i.e. the names and location) of the patents' inventors has seldom been deployed in a large scale, primarily because of the "who is who" problem: the name of a given inventor may be spelled differently across her/his patents, and the exact same name may correspond to different inventors (i.e. the "John Smith" problem). Given that there are over 2 million patents with 2 inventors per patent on average, the "who is who" problem applies to over 4 million "records", which is obviously too large to tackle manually. We have thus developed an elaborate methodology and computerized procedure to address this problem in a comprehensive way. The end result is a list of 1.6 million unique inventors from all over the world, with detailed data on their patenting histories, their employers, co-inventors, etc. Forty percent of them have more than one patent, and 70,000 have more than 10 patents. We can trace those multiple inventors across time and space, and thus study the causes and consequences of their mobility across countries, regions, and employers. Given the increasing availability of large computerized data sets on individuals, there may be plenty of opportunities to deploy this methodology to other areas of economic research as well.}

This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability.},

The cDTM is a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian motion to model the latent topics through a sequential collection of documents, where a ``topic'' is a pattern of word use that we expect to evolve over the course of the col- lection. We derive an efficient variational approximate inference algorithm that takes advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a property that lets us easily han- dle many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized. Moreover, the complexity of vari- ational inference for the dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a drawback which limits fne-grained discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the notion of temporally constrained ranked retrieval, which, given a query and a time constraint, produces the best possible ranked list within the specified time limit. Naturally, more time should translate into bet- ter results, but the ranking algorithm should always pro- duce some results. This property is desirable from a number of perspectives: to cope with diverse users and information needs, as well as to better manage system load and variance in query execution times. We propose two temporally con- strained ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic prediction models that can naturally incorporate efficiency constraints: one that makes independent feature selection de- cisions, and the other that makes joint feature selection de- cisions. Experiments on three different test collections show that both ranking algorithms are able to satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver more effective results, especially under tight time constraints, due to its ability to capture feature dependencies.},

We present TreeMiner, a novel algorithm to discover all frequent subtrees in a forest, using a new data structure called scope-list. We contrast TreeMiner with a pattern matching tree mining algorithm (PatternMatcher), and we also compare it with TreeMinerD, which counts only distinct occurrences of a pattern. We conduct detailed experiments to test the performance and scalability of these methods. We also use tree mining to analyze RNA structure and phylogenetics data sets from bioinformatics domain.},

Two hypotheses are posed: individuals communicate more frequently with other individuals who share similar value patterns than with individuals with different value patterns; and people who communicate more frequently with each other share similar value patterns. The first hypothesis is supported: indeed, individuals were found to communicate more frequently with individuals who share similar value patterns, and further, the extent to which this is true appears to depend at least in part on the value patterns themselves. However, the second hypothesis is not supported - people who communicate more frequently with each other do not necessarily all fit into a particular value type. Thus, values have utility as a novel tool for social network analysis.},

This paper presents Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models by minimizing an expected margin loss, an upper bound of the existing margin loss derived from an expected prediction rule. By introducing augmented variables, we develop simple and fast Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions and no need to solve SVM subproblems for both classification and regression. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency. The classification performance is also significantly improved over competitors.}

  abstract = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation models a document by a mixture of topics, where each topic itself is typically modeled by a unigram word distribution. Documents however often have known structures and the same topic can exhibit different word distributions under different parts of the structure. We extend latent Dirichlet allocation model by replacing the unigram word distributions with a factored representation conditioned on both the topic and the structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when used for classification.},
