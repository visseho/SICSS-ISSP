2718077083,"Ambitious play is among the best of the season:   Production shines with rich language, colourful characters and beguiling choreography",Aucun(e) disponible.,"shimmering with rich language, colourful characters and incisive humour, """"cockroach,"""" the latest play by acclaimed theatre artist ho ka kei (jeff ho), is an introspective exploration of survival, identity and migration
its world premiere at tarragon theatre, deftly helmed by artistic director mike payette and buoyed by a trio of incendiary performances, is far and away one of the strongest new productions of the year
coming-of-age, immigrant stories on canadian stages are about as abundant as new condos in toronto - this season alone, you need look no further than """"dixon road"""" and the toronto fringe hit """","""" both fantastic - but ho skilfully breaks the mould of these oft-told tales by traversing into terrain rarely seen in the theatre
perhaps the word that comes closest to characterizing ho's mercurial, shape-shifting play is """"choreopoem,"""" a term coined by american playwright and poet ntozake shange to describe her first work, """"for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf""""
what both """"cockroach"""" and """"for colored girls"""" share is the way text and movement, the auditory and the visual, are fused together to create a cerebral, out-of-body experience
the proceedings are built around a loose narrative of three seemingly disparate characters: a shrewd cockroach (steven hao); a bard, or rather the spirit of william shakespeare (karl ang); and a boy (anton ling) processing a traumatic event
it's ambiguous, at first, how the three characters are connected we first meet hao's cockroach, smoking some catnip on the lip of the stage for the first third of the play, in an almost fantastical sequence, he recounts his life journey: from his conception at a whitney houston concert and his, rather graphic, birth in a soiled baby's diaper to his journey across oceans from america to hong kong and back east across the pacific ocean to canada
then there's ang's restless bard, bemoaning his immortality and how his words continue to live on in the minds and speech of those who study his work in an energetic scene, he bounds across the stage, rattling off sayings he invented and the plays from which they originated are our thoughts really ours, he asks, if the words and phrases we use to form them come from someone else?
as the play unravels, the bug and the bard squabble over ling's timid boy, whose hunched posture and disconsolate eyes recede into the background of the overwhelming, grey urban jungle that is christine ting-huan urquhart's set
their stories begin to intertwine and, in a way, are one and the same seemingly insignificant details return with added resonance
the insect and the spirit of shakespeare, at least the way i interpreted it, are parts of the boy's fractured self the cockroach is the unwanted half: the pest, the foreigner living in the shadow of other creatures the bard is what we inherit - our language, our adopted culture - but that may not be truly who we are
i am loathe to reveal how exactly the three characters come together, but i will say the scene when it does occur, toward the end of ho's -minute play, is haunting and deeply moving
that the journey up to that point is so utterly rewarding is in no small part thanks to ho's text, which is dense and layered, peppered with sharp humour and an idiosyncratic style that leaves lines flying off the stage and bouncing between characters
under payette's assured direction, the marriage between the material and the creative team's vision is in complete harmony hanna kiel's beguiling choreography accentuates the inherent poetry in ho's script hao, ang and ling twist, slide and climb over and across each other and the multi-level set
each of the actors offer crackling performances hao and ang are larger than life as the cockroach and bard, with a magnifying presence that consumes the -seat tarragon mainspace meanwhile, ling's quiet performance as the boy draws the audience in through its subtlety and nuanced detail
there is much to unpack in these three performances and in ho's ambitious new work - far more than is possible in a -word review as i write this monday, four days after opening night, i still find myself parsing ho's expressive language, as the layers of the work and the connections within continue to linger and steep in my mind

2640492665,Let some Ukrainian refugee kids learn in English,Aucun(e) disponible.,"it was the suffering of children that ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy so poignantly emphasized when he addressed the house of commons on tuesday and the killing and maiming of kids that he so graphically depicted in a video he played during a speech to the us congress on wednesday
""""dear justin, dear guests, can you imagine that every day you receive memorandums about the number of casualties, including women and children?"""" zelenskyy said in a direct appeal to prime minister justin trudeau and canadian parliamentarians
bloodied babies, lifeless toddlers and crying preschoolers figured prominently in a montage of the destruction caused by russia's bombing that zelenskyy showed to us lawmakers
in addition to the deaths and injuries, youngsters make up the bulk of the roughly three million refugees who have fled ukraine most have been separated from their fathers, who must stay behind to fight some have also left without their mothers, travelling with grandparents - or even alone - to foreign lands
as the smallest victims of putin's war crimes disperse across europe and the world, canada is among the nations planning to welcome them
premier françois legault said quebec is ready to do its part and there is """"no limit"""" to the number of people the province is willing to take in government officials, charitable organizations, the local ukrainian community and ordinary citizens are all mobilized to assist
but apparently the quebec government's willingness to help stops short at allowing refugee children who speak english to attend english school after the quebec english school boards association offered to lend a hand resettling refugee children, the education ministry ruled it """"out of the question""""
no exceptions were made for haitian or syrian refugees, an official said, so none will be made for ukrainians
since immigrants to quebec must attend french school under bill , ukrainians looking to live here permanently might as well start adapting to this french-speaking province french schools have experience integrating children from the four corners of the globe in their classes d'accueil the centre de services scolaire de montréal and other service centres have the resources and are already making preparations so there may be a certain logic to this refusal
but no one knows how many ukrainian refugees will be coming or how long they'll stay for some children, this may be a temporary safe haven as they wait to reunite with parents or other relatives in their homeland or elsewhere so why can't english schools help? the drafters of bill  included an exemption on humanitarian grounds these seem like appropriate circumstances to invoke it in certain cases even legault didn't immediately close the door when asked about association's offer
there could be reasonable criteria for triaging who gets to attend english school age, grade level and knowledge of english could be factors, since it's much easier for very young children than for teenagers to learn a new language if the students are being hosted by a family whose children are already in the english system, it might make sense for them to all go to the same school
why not share the responsibility for helping these distressed children with english schools, which tend to have more space and capacity? this doesn't mean quebec should send all ukrainian refugee children to english schools but why does it have to be none? rejecting the schools'assistance outright seems dogmatic and petty
just because the possibility of english school was not offered to haitians escaping after the earthquake is no justification for barring ukrainians french is one of haiti's official languages perhaps a similar offer should have been extended to some syrians, who are more likely to speak english as a second language than french - although it was clear upon arrival most were moving here permanently
quebec should be looking at how best to help traumatized ukrainian children, not adding to their burdens ahanes@postmediacom",The Sudbury Star,2022-03-18,2022,3,18

When the bombing began, a reporter at the Edmonton Journal called him for a local reaction and found that the Imam was in Baghdad for an Islamic conference. Telephoned in Jordan for a reaction, Imam Chebli -- termed here """"good natured and garrulous"""" -- had supported Iraq, not on the invasion of Kuwait but on its promises to help the Palestinians; he opposed the coalition, and thought it wrong for Canada to side with the U.S. His enthusiasm for Islam resulted in Edmonton Journal headlines like """"Local Muslim Cleric Sees [Saddam Hussein] as God Agent.""""","the gulf within
by zuhair kashmeri
lorimer, $ paper
when the americans roused a crusade abroad against saddam hussein  invasion of kuwait, they also roused a crusading mentality at home, according to zuhair kashmeri, a former globe & mail reporter and current editor of now magazine and while us bombers, tanks and guns, with canadian and allied support, blasted the iraqi people back into the past, the media and intelligence services here in canada were tallying a body-count of their own
the canadian victims were innocent arabs and muslims, men, women and children, who were harrassed and even beaten up by fellow canadians immigrants or refugees, they became perceived as enemy, finding little support from government, police or teachers -- often the opposite their experiences are the subject of kashmeri short, devastating indictment of canada racist response to a minority in our midst in a time of crisis
the sparks that caused the negative reaction included saddam (religiously unjustified) call to all muslims to join a jihad against the american coalition, and his unreal claims that terrorists were ready in place to attack western installations yasser arafat leadership didn't help public attitudes towards palestinians and their cause
kashmeri crossed canada to record the stories of those who suffered he tells of the -year old boy kicked out of class because he argued saddam hussein was not a hitler an arab-canadian dentist was fingerprinted and photographed at the american border
riad majeed, an edmonton iraqi engineer, well-connected (until he needed support) with the progressive conservative party, found a pipe bomb outside his townhouse he moved his family, taking a loss on the quick sale his two teen-aged sons were beaten while the school authorities refused to call the police majeed called himself, and one attacker was arrested he also intervened when a man at an edmonton shopping mall abused an old arab woman selling her wares at a flea market the old woman tore off her head covering and spat on it, denouncing islam and muslims
another woman with a headcovering was attacked by two men and two women at a mall, her covering torn off, her blouse pulled open as shoppers hurried by
""""where were the knights in shining armor -- the media -- in all of this?"""" kashmeri asks mostly they were kicking those who were already down, he says imam (islamic prayer and community leader) youssef chebli of edmonton al-rashid mosque came to edmonton, which has a large arab and muslim population, from his native lebanon in  when the bombing began, a reporter at the edmonton journal called him for a local reaction and found that the imam was in baghdad for an islamic conference telephoned in jordan for a reaction, imam chebli -- termed here """"good natured and garrulous"""" -- had supported iraq, not on the invasion of kuwait but on its promises to help the palestinians; he opposed the coalition, and thought it wrong for canada to side with the us his enthusiasm for islam resulted in edmonton journal headlines like """"local muslim cleric sees saddam as god agent""""
""""i said it (the coalition) is a satanic movement; it is madness the big sacrifice to the world is truth, and the big win, hypocrisy,"""" chebli told kashmeri later the edmonton sun ran a story headlined: """"muslim backs 'hero' saddam"""" the results were inevitable the imam and his family started receiving obscene and threatening telephone calls, which escalated until the mosque committee took over his calls from the media
kashmeri attacks the falsity of canadian """"multiculturalism"""" -- which, in a pinch, doesn't protect the elements that make up the cultural mosaic perhaps after all it was only a trudeau government ploy to offset quebec claim to be a distinct society however, he credits the toronto-based near eastern cultural and educational foundation, and the canadian arab federation, headed by james kafieh, a former canadian forces fighter pilot, for opposing harrassment and intimidation by the rcmp, csis and the media the federation produced a pamphlet, when csis calls: an arab canadian guide to civil rights kashmeri singles out ndp mp svend robinson as having been particularly helpful to the minorities here, as was premier bob rae
and it should be noted that in kingston the pattern was in most part different from this story while there was a sign posted at queen university telling muslims to leave canada and an insult to at least one child in a local elementary school -- and probably lots more -- city hall and the kingston police responded positively to minority community concerns about the potential for racial and religious bigotry it to be hoped that the relative calm wasn't only due to the absence of larger minority groups here &",The Kingston Whig-Standard,1992-03-07,1992,3,7
239473890,McGill University: It's where francophones are condemned to excellence:   [Final Edition ],"Exams and term papers can be written in French. Young francophones coming out of Quebec's junior colleges are eagerly courted by [James McGill] recruiters; Those sentiments are echoed by Philippe Archambault, a 20-year-old physics student: """"I think McGill should be a better reflection of Quebec society. I think there should be more courses in French and more French professors. I think McGill should become bilingual."""" [Pierre Anctil] questions the wisdom of that approach. Like [Benoit Beauchemin] and Archambault, he thinks McGill should be offering more to francophones. Indeed, he adds, its survival may depend on it.","  at the centre of mcgill university sits the sturdy, granite tomb of its founder, james mcgill, a scottish-born immigrant who made a fortune in the fur trade in the s
his university was born in , and over the decades developed a reputation for anglophone elitism as solid as the monument over the founder's remains
make no mistake about it -- mcgill is still an english-speaking university but the days when it could be called an anglo-saxon fortress are no more
as officials proudly point out, enrolment lists now abound with names like tremblay and beauchemin of an undergraduate population of ,, a quarter are francophones french-speaking students pass entire days without speaking a word of english
microcosm of canada
""""we are unique,"""" gushes pierre anctil, director of mcgill's french canadian studies program """"no other university has this breakdown not the universite de montreal not the university of toronto mcgill is a microcosm of canada isn't that something?""""
it certainly is, considering the origins through the first century of its existence, mcgill was strongly protestant, staunchly anglophone and viewed with suspicion by quebecois
it began to change after the first world war, but it wasn't until the s that francophones started to take a serious interest in it
five per cent of the student body in , their numbers doubled to  per cent in  and doubled again by  in two faculties, agriculture and physical and occupational therapy, francophones are the majority
this has prompted several changes in the way the university operates:
*
exams and term papers can be written in french young francophones coming out of quebec's junior colleges are eagerly courted by mcgill recruiters;
*
press releases, annual reports and some administrative forms are available in french as well as english since , the university has had a french-language newspaper -- the mcgill daily francais
*
increasingly, faculty members and administrative staff are bilingual since , mcgill has had a francophone chancellor, jean de grandpre, the former chairman of bce inc
mcgill attracts francophones for many reasons, but a  survey revealed the two most important are its reputation and the opportunity to study in english
for most francophones, says anctil, that second factor is an extra burden, but a positive one that often pays off in higher than average marks
""""if they want to do well, they have to study even harder to overcome the language barrier they're condemned to excellence""""
certainly francophone students appear happy with their decision the  survey found well over  per cent were satisfied with their studies and would choose mcgill again
""""if i had to do it again, i'd come back to mcgill,"""" says political science student benoit beauchemin,  """"it's a pretty good university""""
despite that strong endorsement, beauchemin thinks mcgill could and should be doing more to break down the social barriers between its francophone and anglophone students
although the two sides mix well in class, he says, they go their separate ways afterwards when student associations organize activities, they are aimed at anglophones, he adds
those sentiments are echoed by philippe archambault, a -year-old physics student: """"i think mcgill should be a better reflection of quebec society i think there should be more courses in french and more french professors i think mcgill should become bilingual""""
that's unlikely to happen soon principal david johnston says it's a priority at mcgill to ensure that """"our french-speaking students feel at home""""
for the time being, he believes quebec and the academic community are best served by the slow but steady approach that has raised french to its levels of use and acceptance
should offer more
mcgill's policies are reviewed every six to seven years, """"but if you look out over the next five years i expect we'll continue as we have,"""" he says
anctil questions the wisdom of that approach like beauchemin and archambault, he thinks mcgill should be offering more to francophones indeed, he adds, its survival may depend on it
as the anglophone community declines in quebec, he says, mcgill will become ever more dependent on francophone students and graduates to keep its numbers up and its finances healthy
the way to attract them, he adds, is to provide more services in french and get francophone students more involved in university life
""""this need not be a source of conflict,"""" he says """"the search for co-existence is a positive, enriching experience that's why i came to mcgill""""

241055549,Dark future is now:   [Final Edition ],"The whole premise of the film fascinated [Clive Owen], but he was still nervous about the challenge he faced in playing Theo, a disillusioned former political activist turned bureaucrat who has given up and simply stopped caring. When [Alfonso Cuaron] first sent him the script, Owen wasn't sure about the role. Eventually Theo, against his will, does become involved and finds that he does care about the world. Owen believes that his scenes with Michael Caine, in the role of an aging wild-haired hippie friend who lives outside the reach of the authorities in the remote countryside, are pivotal to an understanding of Theo. It rare for Owen to have such vivid memories of doing individual scenes. But it keeps happening with Children of Men. For example, those scenes with Caine: """"The most important thing in those scenes was that it the one place where Theo relaxes. The rest of the time he a defeated, very sad person. There a warmth and a humanity about their relationship. That was what we had to nail in those very few scenes we had.","  clive owen sees children of men as a cautionary tale of a world heading for extermination, he tells jamie portman
santa monica, california - children of men, a movie currently showing up on many ten best lists, is set some  years into the future
but is it really that futuristic? clive owen doesn't think so
""""if you look at the opening scene, my character walks into a cafe, walks outside -- and a bomb goes off that the beginning of the movie that the world we are in now""""
owen is adamant that this adaptation of pd james best- selling novel is not really a fantasy -- despite its vision of a totalitarian britain ruthlessly determined to cope in a world slowly dying because women have been rendered infertile the -year-old actor found the experience of working on this film with acclaimed mexican director alfonso cuaron to be unique, and he regards it as a cautionary tale for today
""""alfonso, i think, has been very clever with this movie he actually using a film set  years in the future as an excuse to talk about present worries, concerns and fears that we all have it an incredibly relevant vision of the future because he really looking ahead and saying: 'if we're not careful, this is where things could be going'""""
children of men opened in september in britain to rave reviews and long lineups it also received the blessing of novelist pd james, who had surprised her fans when the book first appeared because she was departing from the crime-fiction genre that had made her reputation
the film -- considered a dark horse candidate in the oscar sweepstakes -- opens across canada tomorrow owen says the book was clearly a """"huge inspiration"""" for cuaron but that it was also the starting point for the oscar-nominated director to put his own stamp on the story
cuaron is a superb visual stylist whose eclectic output includes a little princess, y tu mama tambien and -- most famously -- harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban
he shares owen view: """"this isn't science fiction it a chase movie set in """" and he saw james novel as """"an amazing opportunity to talk about the present day, using the excuse that it set in the near future
""""i wanted to do a film about the present and the circumstances today that are crafting our future""""
a world in which every normally fertile woman has suddenly become infertile is a world not that far removed from the dire forecasts of environmental groups when the film opens, it is  years since the last baby was born, and now the young man that baby became has died violently it is another symbolic moment for a world gradually giving up all hope for the future, a world sliding into lawlessness and anarchy only in britain, where a totalitarian and militaristic regime has taken charge, is there any stability and that stability comes at the expense of human rights and a determination to stem the tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores
the whole premise of the film fascinated owen, but he was still nervous about the challenge he faced in playing theo, a disillusioned former political activist turned bureaucrat who has given up and simply stopped caring when cuaron first sent him the script, owen wasn't sure about the role
""""i didn't quite know why he wanted me to do it it a highly unusual lead part if you look at that character, he in every scene, but it very unusual traits that he got it not the kind of part where you can sort or do your own thing it about sacrificing yourself to alfonso vision and not getting in the way of it  """"
theo is forced to start caring about his society again when a former lover (julianne moore) re-enters his life she heads an illegal group fighting for the rights of the refugee population and she persuades theo to use his status to secure transit papers for a young woman (clare-hope ashitey) so she can get safely out of the country
the reason for this covert plot is soon clear: she is pregnant, which makes her an international miracle and also a potential pawn if she falls into the hands of the country rulers
theo is her reluctant ally as they desperately seek sanctuary from various sinister factions including anarchists, violent criminals and those who would use the young woman child for political gain
owen -- an actor known for his dark, brooding presence -- found himself playing the ultimate reluctant hero
""""it a highly unusual lead character for a movie of this size really, because for the first half, the guy doesn't even want to be there,"""" he explains """"it very unusual to play a lead character who is apathetic, cynical, depressed, drunk -- and sad, really his overwhelming sadness was the thing theo sort of embodies the loss of hope he given up""""
owen big concern was not to get into the way of cuaron vision he says he has never experienced this kind of collaboration with a director
""""it was a genuine, really brilliant collaboration through the whole movie he kept me in the loop in all the post-production he sent me various cuts and edits and there were endless conversations so it been a very special collaboration and i do genuinely think that he a very rare and unique talent""""
eventually theo, against his will, does become involved and finds that he does care about the world owen believes that his scenes with michael caine, in the role of an aging wild-haired hippie friend who lives outside the reach of the authorities in the remote countryside, are pivotal to an understanding of theo
owen was delighted to be working with caine for a couple of reasons one is caine status in the acting community """"he just a legend he been at the top as long as i've been around""""
the other was that they shared a mutual friend in british director mike hodges """"he did the original get carter, which was an important film in michael career and also croupier, which was a very important film in my career""""
it rare for owen to have such vivid memories of doing individual scenes but it keeps happening with children of men for example, those scenes with caine: """"the most important thing in those scenes was that it the one place where theo relaxes the rest of the time he a defeated, very sad person there a warmth and a humanity about their relationship that was what we had to nail in those very few scenes we had
""""and michael was a delight to work with""""
the toughest time for owen came with the filming of the opening bomb sequence that because the scene was shot in july , not long after the terrorist attacks in the london underground
""""it was really upsetting for everybody because it came so close after the bombings and i was amazed we actually got permission because it was a big explosion and we were right in the centre of london it was just incredibly eerie and awful, i think it an incredibly sort of poignant and profound opening to have that happen and say: 'this is  years time and this is the world we live in now'""""
on this day, owen thought of his two young daughters and his """"fear and trepidation about the future  this feeling of fragility and fear of these things happening
""""you're bringing kids into the world, and this might just become part of their lives  and that an awful and worrying idea, really""""

sovereignty, he said at the laval hearing, was """"the natural evolution"""" of such oppression and he maintained that federalist quebecers would come on side once the initial, difficult step is taken """"it a question of taking that first step""""
later in longueuil, on the opposite side of montreal, entomologist georges brossard said his years of travelling the world collecting bugs has taught him that quebec will only be able to compete internationally when it is an independent country
in a -page, handwritten brief brossard said quebec is """"paralyzed,"""" """"muzzled,"""" """"diminished"""" and """"drowning"""" because of federalism
vice-premier bernard landry praised the testimony at the longueuil commission as """"good and interesting""""
however, he gave a stern lecture to one man who said a sovereign quebec should be white, french and catholic
""""quebec strength is in its tolerance and diversity,"""" he told robert contant
pierrette tremblay, who complained that natives get preferential treatment and also said that the elderly are afraid of losing their pensions, didn't get a similar talking-to by landry
""""she didn't need to be lectured because she was in favor of sovereignty,"""" he said
some witnesses refused to give the thumbs up to either sovereignty or federalism, instead arguing for more decentralization to municipalities and regions or inclusion of cultural communities
while panel members often pressed such witnesses to opt for sovereignty, landry maintained that he wasn't frustrated by their refusal to commit

[Judith Andrew] said the tax imbalance encourages employers to live in Toronto, where house taxes are cheap, but locate their businesses and the jobs that go with them in the 905 edge cities where commercial taxes are lower. TONY BOCK / TORONTO STAR / EYE TO FUTURE: Judith Andrew, vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, says the city's economic future depends on giving tax breaks to small business.","judith andrew, vice-president of the canadian federation of independent business
create new jobs for chronically underemployed young people in toronto? great idea
how can the city help? cut property taxes on small-business people
that was a key message that emerged from interviews with participants in the first of a week-long series of closed-door meetings with community leaders to get ideas to shape the city's future
the city-sponsored sessions - building a vision for toronto - will bring together leaders from business, academe, health, media and other fields to guide development of the city's new official plan
on the tax front, businesses account for  per cent of the total property value but pay  per cent of the taxes, said judith andrew, vice-president of the canadian federation of independent business
residences, excluding rental apartment buildings, make up  per cent of the total value of all property in the city but shoulder only  per cent of the tax burden
that's because the city levies a higher tax rate on business property, said chris ridabock, of the real estate firm j j barnicke ltd
a struggling small business that's renting a building worth $ million pays $, a year in property taxes; the well-heeled owner of a $ million home pays $,, ridabock said
""""commercial taxation is completely out of whack compared to residential for business, it's a problem""""
even within the commercial class, owners of small street-level stores pay much lower taxes than those levied on offices or factories
the imbalance between residential and commercial taxes can work against the city's goal of promoting compact development, discouraging sprawl, improving transit, and creating central city jobs - all underlying themes of yesterday's meeting
andrew said the tax imbalance encourages employers to live in toronto, where house taxes are cheap, but locate their businesses and the jobs that go with them in the  edge cities where commercial taxes are lower
""""that's why you see the hordes of people going up the highways to markham and mississauga they live here and have their businesses out there""""
another unintended consequence is it discourages the startup of new businesses, often the goal of newcomers to toronto who give the city its envied diversity
""""property tax is a profit-insensitive tax,"""" andrew said """"it hits the new firms squarely between the eyes whether you make a penny of profit or not so it's really detrimental to economic development""""
and guess what? it's the new firms that hire young workers, andrew said
research by her small business organization showed that a third of the workers in newly created companies are under  years old
the proportion of young workers is much lower -  per cent - in mature companies that have been operating  years or more, the research found
compared to homeowners, tenants also face a higher burden of taxes built into their rent, which affects the city's goal of preserving affordable housing, andrew said
but nothing the city does with its property tax policies will be sufficient to spur construction of new rental units, ridabock said
in fact, for a year, the city has offered a lower tax rate for new units, but that hasn't kick-started construction
that could only be accomplished with federal government subsidies, ridabock said
""""the federal government has to participate in the costs some of our housing solutions have to have lots of federal dollars in them""""
after all, it's federal immigration policy that brings newcomers to toronto, so ottawa should help pay, he said that includes helping to provide shelter, health care, language classes and job training, he said
""""if the federal government brings folks in, which is a wonderful thing to do, they should be participating more in the cost of making sure they can enter a competitive, working society,"""" ridabock said
that means pointedly reminding federal mps from toronto about their responsibilities, he added
""""do we really hold our federal politicians accountable to the greater toronto area or do they disappear to parliament hill and forget about toronto? i think the opinion is they disappear""""
the city's rich cultural makeup factored heavily in yesterday's discussion but not enough members of cultural communities were there, said debbie douglas, of the ontario council of agencies serving immigrants
""""it was troubling that as part of our discussion we talked about toronto being like the united nations with every face from around the world here, and yet there was a glaring absence of that in the room,"""" douglas said
he noted the discussion will inevitably be shaped by the background and experiences of the participants
""""but what's missing is other issues they may bring to the table that the majority here didn't represent""""
councillor david miller (high park), one of three councillors at the session, agreed the city needs to invite as many voices as possible
""""you hear small business talking about taxes and other groups talking about a lack of employment opportunities they need to be in the same room, talking,"""" miller said
the city of toronto needs a policy on immigration enshrined in its official plan, said duberlis ramos, executive director of the hispanic development council
""""there's a very large influx of newcomers to canada who will shape the character of this city,"""" ramos said
the session didn't produce hard answers to some of the dilemmas the city will face over the next  years or so, said judy lank of raising the roof, a national body that raises awareness and funds for the homeless
""""in terms of specific solutions, i don't think you can do that in one, three-hour session, sitting down with people,"""" lank said
""""but there are nine groups getting together and i think solutions will start falling out""""

""""given that provinces have entered confederation under different terms and operate under different provisions, we believe that special arrangements in provinces based on special needs are a fundamental principle of canadian federalism,"""" says a draft of the report
the spicer report is to be released next week
the -member panel, headed by keith spicer, acknowledges that the idea of """"special arrangements"""" doesn't completely square with what it heard from canadians
many had said they want quebec to stay in confederation but not at any price - or at the expense of a strong federal government
""""most participants outside of quebec, while strongly preferring quebec to stay, have made it equally clear that if quebec wishes to go, the break must be clean,"""" says the report, major excerpts of which were read to the star
prime minister brian mulroney appointed the commission last november in the biggest public consultation in canadian history, the panel spent $ million travelling the country to hear more than , people voice their hopes and fears for canada
the forum, according to the draft report, recommends a review of official bilingualism and cuts in funding for multiculturalism
it also found that many canadians are willing to accept quebec as a distinct society, that people want ottawa and the provinces to eliminate overlapping jurisdictions, and that the public is dissatisfied with the behavior of some federal politicians
the forum acknowledges that many of the canadians who participated in its work """"stressed equality among the provinces"""" as a theme of any constitutional reform
but many did so """"without knowing or recognizing that provinces are not perfectly equal and never have been,"""" the draft says
""""our provinces joined confederation at different times on different terms,"""" it says
""""bilingualism was established by our constitution in parliament and the legislatures of manitoba and quebec but not others
""""denominational schools were established in ontario, quebec and newfoundland but not in other provinces there was a provision for special property and civil rights regime from quebec""""
""""the notion of equality of provinces is neither as absolute nor as unbending as some of the participants seem to believe""""
however the draft stops short of recommending which route to take
the forum says it found that, under certain conditions, many canadians outside quebec are prepared to accept quebec as a distinct society - a key provision in the failed meech lake accord
""""with a little probing, quite a few agreed that if distinct meant distinct but broadly equal, they could, in effect, echo: 'vive la difference'""""
the forum urges ottawa and the provinces to eliminate overlapping programs and jurisdictions """"wherever possible"""" and says government efficiency should be a major target of constitutional reform
in an implicit pitch for decentralization, it adds that """"effectiveness can be increased by placing programs as close as practical to the people""""
in one of its strongest statements, the forum joined with participants """"in deploring the mindless and sometimes disgraceful behavior of members of both houses, bringing the parliamentary system into disrepute""""
but aside from urging the government to consider more freedom for individual mps and more consultation with canadians, it avoids more radical proposals, such as the use of referendums
earlier drafts contained suggestions for a more american-style democracy but were scrapped, an insider said
one of the key themes is that canadians do not know enough about their country and their compatriots
""""it is frighteningly clear all across canada that the economic consequences of quebec separation are not appreciated in terms of what it would really mean for canada and quebec,"""" it says
""""we heard concern and uncertainty, vague threats and ultimatums, often with the a flavor of bluff, impatience and wounded pride everywhere - with both quebecers and non-quebecers - we found an appalling and dangerous lack of knowledge of each other""""
but there was also """"an often hesitant eagerness to know real people from the other side when the forum was able to bring people together, even for those brief contacts, they were seized with hope""""
the panel also admits to """"some amazement"""" in discovering how much canadians share basic values such as fairness, """"regardless of language or region""""
on bilingualism, however, the forum concludes that """"the application of the official languages policy is a major irritant outside quebec and not much appreciated inside quebec""""
it calls for a review to clear the air, warning that there is a danger """"that public dissatisfaction and misunderstanding will lead to a rejection of the policy as a whole""""
the purpose of the review """"would be to make it clear to canadians the costs and benefits of official languages policies and activities and explain far more clearly its goals and methods,"""" the draft report says
""""such a review should evaluate public information efforts as well as investigate all of the public expressed concerns""""
the draft report also says greater understanding by canadians outside quebec of that province need to protect its language and culture could contribute to national unity and might encourage quebec to scrap its law requiring french-only outdoor signs
the forum calls for cuts in multiculturalism
""""we believe that federal government funding for multicultural activities - other than those serving immigrant orientation, reduction of racial discrimination and promotion of equality - should be eliminated,"""" it says
it also calls for much better public information programs on the benefits of cultural diversity """"and the enormous contribution of ethnocultural communities to canada""""

The opposition leader next excavated a 2001 interview in which Harper claimed the Liberal party out west is confined to """"recent Asian immigrants, or recent immigrants from Eastern Canada, people who live in ghettos and are not integrated into western Canadian society.""""","  what with his organizational miscues, impenetrable speaking style and jittery caucus, all struggling liberal leader stephane dion has left these days is a reputation for decency but he risks damaging that, too, with over-heated attacks on the conservatives over proposed changes to immigration policy
dion led the liberal charge this week with questions that raise the spectre of an anti-immigrant, even racist, bent in the harper government he dredged up the  reform party platform written by harper it says immigration """"should not radically or suddenly alter the ethnic makeup of canada"""" this, on its own, could sound sinister but it was preceded by a sentence dion didn't read: """"immigration should not be based on race or creed""""
the opposition leader next excavated a  interview in which harper claimed the liberal party out west is confined to """"recent asian immigrants, or recent immigrants from eastern canada, people who live in ghettos and are not integrated into western canadian society"""" that word """"ghetto"""" sounds pejorative (although a ghetto filled with newfoundlanders could be fun), but, even so, the link to today's conservative party and its specific plans to change immigration procedures seems tenuous
in fact, prime minister harper has been ardently courting the so-called cultural communities, even anointing industrious calgary mp jason kenney as his good-will ambassador his party has cut the landing fee, apologized for the chinese head tax, provided more resettlement money and made other conciliatory gestures aimed at winning votes in the country's multi-ethnic suburbs just yesterday, it repudiated saskatchewan chief david ahenakew anew for his unforgivable anti-semitic outburst the point is that, whatever their differences in the past, contemporary conservative and liberal approaches to religious and ethnic minorities overlap considerably
both, for example, make a priority of attracting skilled immigrants in an increasingly competitive world market, but both continue to allow for family reunification the current contretemps was provoked by a tory plan to give the immigration minister expanded powers to """"cherry-pick"""" the waiting lists of prospective immigrants to get qualified newcomers into waiting jobs as quickly as possible this appears to make abundant sense: canada gets the skills it needs and new arrivals don't have to resort to welfare plus, says immigration minister diane finley, it helps break the """"logjam"""" of some , applications
if only the mess was that easy to fix liberal mp judy sgro, a former immigration minister, says the """"inventory issue is overblown"""" -- that some on the waiting list have died, others have moved on that said, she doesn't believe the conservative approach is racist """"they recognize what we recognize: we need to make changes but the way they are doing it is wrong"""" the minister doesn't need so much arbitrary power, she insists; canada can recruit the workers it needs under current rules, with more resources and a re-designed points system and it must ensure foreign professionals are allowed to practise once they get here, which is hardly a new problem
but while some concerns about the changes are valid, some amount to fear-mongering -- which isn't limited to the liberals new democrat olivia chow, for instance, told the asian pacific post that if the changes go ahead """"refugee children in canada will no longer be able to bring their family to canada"""" this is a gross distortion, but not unusual in this or any other """"debate"""" in the debased federal arena
the conservatives, of course, are no strangers to innuendo; harper and peter mackay elevated the smear to high art in opposition nor are they innocent of ulterior motives -- although their plan may be to embarrass the liberals, as much as to manipulate immigration to bar undesirables as their critics charge by """"sneaking"""" these major changes into the budget bill (on the pretext of urgency), they are laying a trap for dion after all their dire warnings, liberals are expected to allow the budget, and its embedded immigration reforms, to pass if they don't, they force an election
judy sgro, for one, is ready to go other liberals, not so much navdeep bains, for instance, mp for mississauga-brampton south, says liberals will simplify their message in coming months -- on everything from immigration to the environment -- then choose their moment he admits some constituents are uneasy with liberal inaction, but """"we don't yet see the wave for change that you have in the united states""""
in an ideal world, this complex issue would be discussed in an abuse-free atmosphere, informed by expert advice and reliable statistics -- perhaps at a special parliamentary committee instead, all parties are fanning fears and claiming virtue -- and, incidentally, reducing a diverse and growing immigrant constituency to electoral fodder
as for dion, under pressure from nervous advisers it looks as if he may be abandoning his natural inclinations and the high road too bad there is so much less traffic up there

just as scholars and political activists examined the gender gap two and three decades ago, so are they currently putting what political scientist anver saloojee calls the """"racial divide"""" under the microscope

are power brokers getting cold feet about having a liberal party president who might hold great sway over the tens of thousands of new liberal party members, many of them signed up en masse in ethnic minority communities, to ensure mr martin victory as liberal party leader?
speculation is rife in mr maharaj camp that such questions prompted an th-hour candidacy against him by london lawyer mike eizenga, a former president of ontario liberals who has the backing of some of mr martin campaign organizers
mr maharaj campaign chairman has said riding association presidents across the country have been pressured by the martin campaign to back mr eizenga or count themselves out if they ever want to work in the prime minister office mr martin spokesman has said his boss is neutral and that members of his campaign are free to back whomever they want
mr maharaj was born in toronto and raised by his grandparents from trinidad, both of whom worked in a spice factory he went to oxford on scholarships and distinguished himself there by becoming the first person from outside the united kingdom to win the presidency of the prestigious oxford university student union
if he wins the presidency at the liberal party convention nov  to nov , mr maharaj will not want to credit the fact that he is a visible minority neither will he like to think that racism did him in if he does not win
""""i have heard the allegations of racism, particularly from some long-time martin organizers who are trying to understand why a small group appears to be misusing the martin campaign name to violate their own platform on combating the democratic deficit,"""" mr maharaj said
""""however, i support paul because i know he is an honourable person, and i know he would never countenance a hint of such behaviour if there are indeed people acting from unworthy motives and doing so from within his campaign staff, i should not want to be in their shoes when he catches up to them""""
such is the backdrop to a political race that is of great interest to such scholars as mr saloojee, who argues the health of democracy is at stake if visible minorities, especially among newcomers to canada, do not have many role models in politics, do not feel welcome, or do not feel there a level playing field
""""in a country that draws a million or so immigrants every four- to five-year period, we are going to have some pretty big challenges if we don't do anything,"""" says mr saloojee, a ryerson university political scientist and head of the political participation research network
the notable national trend is that a towering  per cent of the  million immigrants who arrived in canada in the decade ending in census year  were visible minorities -- mostly chinese, other asians and blacks the majoritysettled first in the big cities of toronto, vancouver and montreal, but tens of thousands were also attracted to such smaller cities as calgary, edmonton, halifax and ottawa
in two canadian cities, visible minorities have become the majority -- richmond, bc, where visible minorities comprise  per cent of the population, and markham, ont, where they comprise  per cent
in toronto, mr saloojee said, where visible minorities constitute  per cent of the population, but """"the majority of councillors is still white in toronto city council, there no aboriginal representation and people of colour are significantly under-represented""""
in ottawa, more than , immigrants, or nearly  per cent, of the city immigrant population arrived in the decade ending in  about one if five residents is an immigrant and one in five is a visible minority those figures are forecast to double by 
in surveys conducted during the last five years of ottawa-area politicians at all levels of government -- federal, provincial, regional and municipal -- only one elected politician was counted as a member of a visible minority (lebanese-born ottawa-centre mp mac harb has since been appointed to the senate)
in this month ontario election, there were no visible minority candidates running in or near ottawa for any of the three mainstream political parties
the largest visible-minority communities in ottawa are chinese (,), lebanese (,), east indian (,), somali (,), arab (,), vietnamese (,), jamaican (,) and haitian (,)
""""we're not just saying 'run for office,' but there multiple ways in which people participate,"""" mr saloojee said """"who does government consult regularly? who considered part of the broader public-policy community? who does government appoint to various agencies, boards and commissions? and if you're not in the political party and they don't owe you favours, do you get onto agencies, boards and commissions?""""
these questions are at the heart of the toronto-based canadian centre for political leadership, which offers women, visible minority and aboriginal people education and training to run for public office or to pursue positions on municipal agencies, boards and commissions
the training attempts to """"demystify"""" politics, to identify political strategies and to build a talent bank of candidates """"even having an accent can pose a problem,"""" says the centre director, annamie paul
ms paul, who studied law at the university of ottawa, says there is so much talent and enthusiasm that  applicants quickly applied for  training positions for a session in toronto aimed at preparing candidates for municipal office the centre hopes to run sessions in ottawa soon
political scientist jerome black of mcgill university has tracked visible minority representation in parliament and describes the results of the last federal election, in november , as """"sobering for any expectation that each new election would produce a record level of minority mps""""
in the  federal election,  visible-minority mps were elected, up sharply from the five elected in  in the  election,  visible minorities won seats but in , the number dropped to  visible minorities, comprising only  per cent of the commons, far less than the  per cent of the population counted as visible minorities in the  census
mr black cites incumbency as one of the major reasons the political old guard stays intact from election to election in the  election, for instance,  of the  incumbents were re- elected and of the  new mps, two had been members of the  parliament
""""minorities, as with all new social groups seeking to gain more representation, must confront the general norm that discourages challenges to sitting members (who usually occupy the party most desirable constituencies) and the potential high costs of urban nomination contests,"""" mr black reported local constituency organizations act as """"gatekeepers"""" who may lock out minorities, a phenomenon that women faced on a systematic basis until the mid- s
mr black says the upsurge in minorities elected in the  federal election was in part due to unforeseen vote-splitting between progressive conservative and reform supporters, paving the way for some minority liberal mps to win in ridings where their prospects had been low
also, visible minority candidates in the canadian alliance were elected, a phenomenon that was described in one conference summary as """"counter-intuitive""""
mr black also documented evidence that women and minorities, especially visible minorities, appear to need higher than average educational and professional qualifications to enter politics, at least at the federal level
he found that while  per cent of the  mps who won seats in the last three federal elections had at least an undergraduate university degree,  per cent of visible minority mps had an undergraduate degree and  per cent of visible minority mps had advanced degrees, compared to  per cent of all mps
ms paul reported that many of the highly educated visible- minority participants in training sessions have to be persuaded that they do not need yet another degree or other extra credential before they take the plunge

Was it not Greece that passed a special law in 1928 to change all the Macedonian names of people and places to sound Greek? Was it not customary during the decade of the 1950s for Macedonian people living in Greece to be punished for speaking Macedonian?","group wants macedonia for macedonians
i would like to respond to the letter headlined: greece not opposing skopje people independence, which appeared in the star of april 
as citizens of this great country of canada, with its deep-rooted democratic traditions, we are in a continuous state of disbelief at the actions of greece (the mother of democracy) against the macedonian people desire for independence
although we regret to subject our fellow canadian citizens to what may appear to them as a feud between two ethnic groups that have brought their petty arguments to canada, we are compelled to answer in order to correct the half truths and inaccuracies contained in mr john belulis' letter
firstly, contrary to mr belulis' statement, greece is the lone country within the eec opposed to the recognition of a country by the name of the rebublic of macedonia it is greece exercise of its veto that has to date prevented the recognition of macedonia how many frequent flyer points have greek prime minister mitsotakis and ex-foreign minister samaras accumulated in their desperate world-wide lobbying effort?
in fact it was mitsotakis' th-hour plea to us president george bush that led the us to postpone recognition of macedonia this is despite the fact that the eec special commission ruled in january that macedonia and slovenia were the only ones of the former yugoslav republics that fulfilled all of the eec criteria for recognition
the world opinion of greece actions is best summarized by a recent editorial in the new york times: """"greece, the country that introduced europe to comedy and tragedy, now leads its european community partners into a shameful diplomatic farce"""" the times is not alone in its view the toronto star, the globe and mail and the european have all run editorials advocating immediate recognition of macedonia
secondly, contrary to mr belulis' statement the great powers did not convene after the world wars to draw the borders of the balkan states and the great powers were not the ones that allowed the incoporation of macedonian territory within yugoslavia and bulgaria
it is a well known historical fact that macedonia was the prized trophy over which the two balkan wars were fought in -, prior to both world wars aug ,  in bucharest, romania on the darkest day in macedonian history, greece, bulgaria, serbia and montenegro, the victors in the balkan wars, sat down and carved macedonia into pieces and proceeded to assimilate the macedonian population
thirdly, the first time the name macedonia was used to identify a group of people outside of greece was not at the end of the second world war there are abundant impartial sources, we shall quote from two:
""""why not macedonia for the macedonians, as well as bulgaria for the bulgarians and serbia for the serbians"""" - william e gladstone, jan , 
""""   the canadian census says nothing about macedonians in the  analysis of the population yet on making inquiries of proud parents, i found that the macedonians themselves claim to number not less than , in canada of whom about  per cent are canadian born as macedonia is not shown on the map as a separate state, they are apparently listed as bulgarians, greeks, or yugoslavs"""" - john m gibbon, the canadian mosaic, mccleland & stewart, toronto, 
we can't help but ask why didn't gladstone (prime minister of great britain for three terms) say anything about the greekness of macedonia? why those immigrants to canada that emigrated as citizens of greece or bulgaria or yugoslavia did not join those respective communities but rather formed their own, that is, a macedonian community tito was not yet on the scene
fourthly, regarding philip ii of macedon and alexander iii (the great), we do not purport to be anthropology or archaeology experts we shall, however, bring to your attention the following taken from the  grollier electronic encyclopedia under kingdom of macedonia:
""""archealus (d bc)    fostered the hellenization of his people by inviting famous greek artists""""    to macedonia """"philip ii (r-)    in  decisively ended greek liberty by defeating thebes and athens at chaeronea""""
""""macedonia remained the dominant power in greece until conquered by rome""""
in the centuries following the roman conquest there was a huge influx of slavs that migrated to the balkans reaching as far south as the peloponese in southern greece the present day macedonians are the result of the intermingling of these slavs with the ancient macedonians that is why the characteristics of the present day macedonians are slavic
saints cyril and methody, the macedonia brothers from salonica who brought christianity to the slavs, were expecially commissioned because they spoke the salonica dialect and could be """"understood by all slavs"""" was this salonica dialect a greek dialect? need we remind everyone that in , , greeks from turkey were settled in the part of macedonia that is in greece thus altering the ethnic makeup of the area was it not greece that passed a special law in  to change all the macedonian names of people and places to sound greek? was it not customary during the decade of the s for macedonian people living in greece to be punished for speaking macedonian?
we do not believe it necessary to take up any more space the macedonian community of windsor, with members who have been subjected to assimilation, persecution and torture for years at the hands of our neighbors, are asking only for a macedonia for the macedonians is this an unrealistic expectation?

having someone at home who believes in the woman is another advantage for elmaraghy, that continues to be waguih, """"my life partner and my professional partner and my best supporter professionally and personally he became a chief design engineer at dofasco and was responsible for the design of the toronto go bi-level train which is still in service until now and will be for many years to come because of its excellent design and low maintenance""""

2185831207,A policing agent of change; OUR VIEW,Aucun(e) disponible.,"it's easy being a cop you've got the law in your hip pocket
and you enforce it of course, being a good cop isn't so easy
discretion, patience and compassion are some of the human attributes
that raise the community value of policing
the same for being chief, a position that also requires the vision
and maturity to keep a police force and its people changing and
innovative
and that pretty much sums up the  years bill closs has spent as
chief in this city under his leadership, the kingston police force
has evolved and progressed with the times with his retirement this
week, due to serious health issues, closs leaves the city police in
better shape than when he first took the position in 
police techniques and social values have changed exponentially
during that time and closs has kept kingston police riding the wave
of change
coming to kingston after  years of service with the ontario
provincial police, he was faced with some tough budget problems
created by provincial downloading, the social contract cutbacks and
later
the amalgamation of the three municipalities into one city
under his leadership, kingston became the first jurisdiction in
ontario to introduce option four motorists charged with traffic
offences could, for a fee, write a driver refresher test through
city police the result was to divert what had been a provincial
fine into local coffers
in , closs started a data collection project to record the race
and ethnicity of all people stopped by city police officers it came
in reaction to several years of questionable incidents involving
kingston police and visible minorities
the cops on the street didn't like the plan and police chiefs
across canada criticized it but closs persevered, and the
subsequent analysis found that black people were three times as
likely to be stopped by kingston police officers as white people
closs created the community policing volunteers who help direct
traffic, attend civic events and even look for stolen vehicles in
the course of their duties he established the canine unit
closs has also made the case over the years that, as the federal
prison capital of canada, kingston experiences an elevated rate of
crime because many inmates are released into this community his
case for federal funds to compensate for this phenomenon has always
fallen on deaf ears in ottawa
but he hasn't given up on the issue recently, he lobbied the
federal government to allow police officers to spend time inside
prison with offenders about to be released into the community, to
get to know them and establish a relationship again, he was turned
down but he tried
a serious heart condition and resulting complications brought closs
to this retirement decision sooner than he had planned but he's
typically reflective and ready to roll with the sudden change,
realizing that after  years of sacrificing family time, he now has
an opportunity to start making up for it
when asked about finding his successor, closs had this to say to
the whig: """"it's too easy to maintain the status quo in policing a
chief can come in and say, 'oh well, we've got about a thousand
different policies and procedures, i'll just let this ship run
itself,' and that's not what you want  you want somebody who's an
agent of change, or willing to change or always looking to improve""""

meanwhile, on radios and stereos from victoria to st john's, bobby gimby's jingly-jangly canada song, aka the centennial song (one little, two little, three canadians), was on the lips of youngsters and parents everywhere, selling an unprecedented , copies gordon lightfoot's canadian railroad trilogy, commissioned by the cbc for its july  broadcast, lives on a half-century later as among canada's most iconic anthems
more informally, though, canadians celebrated like never before residents of st paul, alta, chipped in to build a ufo landing pad, still awaiting (i believe) the touchdown of its first extraterrestrial visitor a vancouver woman, meanwhile, rode her horse, cobbler, to ottawa
there were bathtub races and confederation-themed parades born of little more than an urge to rejoice, choirs sprang up everywhere dry cleaners offered free flag-cleanings, while paddlers, donkey-riders and antique-car enthusiasts traversed the nation rummage sales were held, poems were written, trees planted and vows exchanged we asked citizen readers to share their stories of what they were doing on july ,

in , i had completed my first year of a german language course at u of o and was enrolled in a working holiday program sponsored by the german embassy i was hired as a chambermaid in a hotel in steinhuder meer, germany i never worked so hard in my life, up at : am, scrubbing floors and toilets for two hours till breakfast alongside turkish and spanish guest workers i was also so lonely
early in the morning of july , the head of our cleaning crew rushed up to me and in a breathless voice urged me to come with her: """"schnell"""" i raced behind her to the hotel's bar area which still reeked of beer and sweat, followed by half my workmates who knew something out of the ordinary was happening and it was extraordinary: a transatlantic phone call from my mother and father back in canada with trembling hands i held the phone and my father's voice came over the miles: 'happy canada day, sweetheart'my father had come home from shift work at midnight, woke up my mother and together they figured out how to make their first transatlantic call this was no mean feat in  as it involved several transatlantic operators and overland cable connections to reach a small hotel in a small village in germany the conversation was short and halting due to the delay in voice transmission back then, and also expensive as i well knew a few minutes later i returned to cleaning toilets, but with great pride for my country and love for my parents who gave me this special gift on canada's th birthday jennie aliman in , i was  years old and living in toronto i went with my parents and boyfriend to fort york, where there was a re-enactment with soldiers and cannons
later, we went to visit an old friend of my mother's who lived alone in a tiny house she had baked a cake for canada's th birthday, complete with  candles! we sang o canada and watched the glow of those candles until they burned down
marion king
in , i arrived in canada as a young and naive immigrant from england i had planned to stay for only one year, and so i knew very little about canada except that english was spoken, and i had an aunt here somewhere, and therefore my mother deemed it safe for her daughter to visit
when i first arrived, all i heard was """"canada's th birthday,"""" to the point where i was left with the impression that there was nothing here before  - a sort of big bang theory of canada
i wanted to go north where i understood there was a shortage of nurses, but the immigration people told me i should become acculturated in the south before i headed north i found a job in hamilton but, never having lived in an industrial city in england, hated it so before long i was on the phone to moose factory asking when i could come they said, """"get on the next train"""" so i did, with a brief detour to montreal to see expo 
i marvelled at the amount of space there was in canada on my journey between hamilton and montreal, so you can imagine that i was totally overwhelmed by even more space on my train journey north the country seemed to have no end i think that was the beginning of my education about canada - lots of space and also lots of time, not just  years

in , i was a young mother recently moved from ontario to pei i was asked to direct the first confederation choir (originally called the centennial choir) which was a great opportunity we gave a lot of concerts around pei in the summers of  and  it was a hand-picked choir of about  members we were encouraged to send a tape to the committee that selected choirs to sing at expo  we were chosen so we had the great adventure of taking the train to montreal and singing four times in open-air venues at expo we were housed in a university residence
we were also invited to sing on parliament hill, which was the highlight for me i will never forget directing the choir as i looked at the parliament buildings with the flag flying as the sun set i am sure that tears were flowing down my face a very special experience in my life happy memories all these years later

i was a post-doctoral fellow at the clarendon laboratory in oxford, uk during  and ' when our centennial was approaching, canada house notified canadians in oxford that space had been secured for a party on july ,  moreover, duty-free canadian whiskey, beer and wine (such as it was  years ago) would be brought over by """"diplomatic bag"""" for the party big bag, i thought! all canadians in town were invited as well as their english guests who could refuse such an invitation? i had made a point of not seeking out other canadians during my english sojourn because i wanted to fit into the english milieu as a result, when i arrived with my english girlfriend at the centennial party, i was astonished at the size of the crowd there was singing of o canada, music, dancing, food and a fair amount of alcohol in various forms it was a fine celebratory occasion
ironically, we canadians were constantly correcting our english guests who consistently called july  """"canada day"""" """"no,"""" we kept saying, """"it's not canada day, it's dominion day"""" ah, me, how things change when you're not paying attention

it was about that time that i decided i would not travel to europe until i had been to all  provinces i made it out west to the prairie provinces and bc one summer in university, and to newfoundland as part of the mount allison university synchronized swimming team i spent a year in europe upon graduation from university since then, i have been to the yukon for pleasure and the northwest territories (yellowknife) on business, flying back via iqaluit (it was the dead of winter so not much to see)

Or in his university's words, """"During the 1990s, he helped to shape the highly innovative doctoral program that promotes the spanning of 'human geography' and 'physical geography.' """"","iain wallace retired last month after  years of teaching geography at carleton university but first, the canadian association of geographers gave him an award for decades of putting humanity into all those maps
we shape the world's spaces just as they shape us, he teaches or in his university's words, """"during the s, he helped to shape the highly innovative doctoral program that promotes the spanning of 'human geography' and 'physical geography' """"
""""i like to present it as a way of connecting all the dots between how people - individuals, communities, nations - live on the earth and how the nature of the earth impacts their activity,"""" wallace says """"and how increasingly their activity impacts the global system the biosphere, global warming, that sort of thing
""""so it's a big-picture discipline"""" within that picture he likes to help students see the connections between their daily lives and the broad systems of air, water and earth
his writing in textbooks and journals often deals with economics the connection with geography is easy to see there
but there's also religion and health and refugees
wallace is an active member of the anglican church, which is currently divided over same-sex marriage
he's for it many members aren't, and some of the strongest opposition is in africa
so, he wonders, does that mean that africans are socially conservative? if so, how does that explain the strong support from desmond tutu?
the geographer in him sees another perspective
""""one can trace some of this to the geography of missionary activity in the th century and so on, in terms of which parts of the anglican church proselytized where, and what sense of the church community they gave, and how the european-delivered gospel was taken up by different africans"""" with different cultures
""""my background is in the economic side, but in the last  years as religion has become more prominent on the international relations sphere and in human rights,"""" he has folded it into his geography
canada is an example closer to home, he notes: in some ways the europeans who settled in canada were split less along english-french lines than by religion, as catholics and protestants
that is still seen today in the way different communities welcome immigrants or refugees from different nations or religions, he says """"it's a fact of canadian life""""
and that has implications in turn for a region's growth and economic prosperity
""""some of my colleagues who worked on the historical atlas of canada have mapped that sort of relationship very expressively""""
canadians still have a land-based view of geography """"i think most people would still say it's about wilderness and natural history and animals and so on""""
but the connection with daily human life keeps popping up for instance, obesity is a greater problem in suburbs; one theory blames the physical layout that makes people drive everywhere
""""health geography is a growing field""""
he likes the physical scale of ottawa, but part of him envies calgary, where you can take the c-train into the landscape of big buildings
""""you're in a real city and i'm afraid driving down wellington street or walking down the sparks street mall does not have the same feel""""

1558251310,Look to our diasporas for foreign policy input,"With dozens of diaspora communities, Canada is blessed with an invaluable foreign-policy resource of experts, global networks, deep wells of human intelligence, and - heaven forbid - ballot-box moxy.","  let's say that the critics are right, that the conservatives are indeed running this country's foreign policy in ways that are most sedulously attentive to the sensitivities of canada's diverse and sundry ethnic and immigrant communities
let's say that the potential votes of  million ukrainian-canadians has been the foremost consideration in canada's militant backing of ukraine's resistance to vladimir putin's irredentist thuggery in crimea, donetsk and luhansk, where more than , people have been killed and at least , people have been uprooted in recent months
let's say, too, that the reason prime minister stephen harper boycotted the commonwealth conference in sri lanka last november was mostly because , tamil-canadians have had to watch helplessly as their families back home were being subjected to ethnic cleansing
let's suppose canadian defence and foreign affairs institute (cdfai) fellow david carment got it right when he said harper's sri lanka boycott was merely """"pandering to a domestic audience,"""" and that the liberal-era ambassador to ukraine and russia, christopher westdal, is just as right when he says canada has now adopted a full-on """"diasporadriven foreign policy"""" liberal leader justin trudeau made the same sort of claim in april: """"whether it's positioning around israel or working closely with the united states, (stephen harper is) very, very much focused on what is going to play well at the ballot box""""
let's be totally cool and even overlook the irony of trudeau saying that while pandering to the iranian-canadian vote in a meeting with the editors of the farsi-english newspaper salam toronto
here's the thing even if these claims are true, so what? parliament obtained full foreign-affairs sovereignty from britain only with the passage of the statute of westminster in  i can't seem to find the codicil stipulating that foreign-policy jurisdiction was to be transferred only to wheezy upper canada diplocrats, yesteryear un ambassadors, boring middle eastern studies grad students and the twilight alumni of the norman paterson school of international affairs
canada is a bustling multicultural democracy one-fifth of canadians are foreignborn with dozens of diaspora communities, canada is blessed with an invaluable foreign-policy resource of experts, global networks, deep wells of human intelligence, and - heaven forbid - ballot-box moxy
where better to turn for guidance and close consultation?
three years ago, the mosaic institute and the walter and duncan gordon foundation undertook an in-depth analysis of the potential for canada's diaspora communities to more directly and usefully inform foreign policy the government hasn't paid it much attention, but what's worth noticing here is that the authors of the """"tapping our potential"""" study straight away encountered a cynical old-guard view that the whole idea was a bad one to start with
there was a """"general skepticism"""" in foreign-policy circles, """"a view, in other words, that foreign policy is best left to the experts""""
that skepticism shows in an essay by the cdfai's david carment, co-authored with carleton university's yiagadeesen samy: """"by playing the diaspora card, canada's leaders are opening up the country to exploitation by other countries looking to disrupt our internal affairs, using diasporas to lobby or influence our leaders or bring their conflicts here""""
that's exactly what one would expect some imperial office geezer to mutter into his gin and tonic
to be fair, though, it's a point, and it may be even salient in the case of, say, the frantic back-scratching around the canada-china business council, where not a few swells from both the liberal and conservative parties have found lucrative sinecures
but where the rhetoric about unseemly ethnic influences tends to get positively lurid is in the matter of canada's approach to israel and palestine it's all about """"the scramble to lock up the jewish vote in canada,"""" the cranky former diplomat robert fowler complained in a rant to the liberal party's canada at  """"leading thinkers"""" gathering in montreal four years ago
after the sufferings endured by the people of gaza during israel's operation pillar of defence in  and this summer's operation protective edge, it has become only more fashionable to bang on like that but is there any truth to it? to be fair again, a kernel or two, sure jewish names can be noticed among those voters who shifted from liberal to conservative in recent elections so what?
to their credit, new democrats generally refrain from shouting about """"pandering to ethnic constituencies"""" ndp mps prefer to take such opportunities as arise to point it out when liberals and conservatives pander to canada's moneyed constituencies
it's true that multiculturalism minister-for-life jason kenney has transformed the hard political work of addressing diaspora concerns into a form of postmodernist performance art, much to the liberals' disadvantage
but not long ago the liberals were running canada's multicultural circuits the way tammany hall's ward bosses ran new york's boroughs
""""i don't think that it's wrong to look at values and get a reading of public opinion, but we don't take major public foreign policy decisions based on whether we think we can get more votes here or there,"""" foreign affairs minister john baird told me the other day
""""with respect to our position with israel, i don't think you can say at the end of the day that there's even been a net political plus""""
as for the """"scramble to lock up the jewish vote,"""" canada's jews number about , there are more than a million muslim canadians
by baird's math, there are , jews among his own ottawa-nepean constituents, along with , muslims and arabs
if we dubiously presume that jews vote only for candidates given to full-throated professions of affection for israel, and that arabs and muslims would not, """"then i don't think we're making very good calculation, i would suspect,"""" baird said
canadians were dancing under mirror balls when multiculturalism was entrenched in canada's constitution in  back then the main """"domestic"""" purpose of canadian foreign policy was to lull and flatter voters with conjurings of canada as an honest-broker, peacekeeper nation, unlike those vulgar, warmaking americans fun times
well, disco is dead to build a bold and effective stcentury canadian foreign policy, a re-evaluation of what """"multiculturalism"""" means would be a good thing, but it would be the dumbest thing to turn away from the talents, insights and leadership in this country's diaspora communities

438634823,Toward a global duty; A former minister of foreign affairs shares a vision just for us Axworthy infuriates and ignores reality; at least he has a dream:   [ON Edition ],"On the question of what to do about the 800-pound gorilla next door, [Lloyd Axworthy] ideas aren't merely inadequate, they're minuscule. First, work more closely with Mexico. (Axworthy has to know that Canada and Mexico would always put their national interests first, each by doing side deals with the U.S. if necessary. Also, a pretend alliance between them would merely irritate the gorilla without impeding it in the least.) Next, open more consulates south of the border. (Useful, but marginal, although a grand idea for worn-out Liberals who would have more patronage posts to look forward to.) It therefore at times hard not to get exceedingly exasperated with Axworthy. For extended periods, his feet simply don't touch the ground. He harbours an ill-concealed anti-Americanism, constantly denouncing its militarism while never acknowledging that, as no one else, or indeed all the rest combined not could have done, that its military capability ended the slaughter in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo - and further, as an additional side benefit, protects Canada. For free. His constantly chanted mantra - Canadian foreign policy good; U.S bad - feeds our natural inclination to smugness, and plays blatantly to the gallery. Ultimately, perhaps, the dream itself matters. Axworthy dream would turn on huge numbers of our young people, and no less many ordinary Canadians of all ages and backgrounds and stations in life. It would give us a new sense of our national distinctiveness. His vision deserves a careful hearing by Canadians, by Ottawa - and by Paul Martin.","each year the leaders of the g-, the world biggies, meet to ponder the globe latest economic ills occasionally, they even suggest remedies

as well, shouldn't canada take over the """"ongoing stewardship"""" of the international criminal court? shouldn't we advocate a new and more generous international treaty to protect refugees and to allow more of them to settle in desirable countries, such as canada?
further, shouldn't we lobby for a new """"global human rights information centre"""" to disseminate information about those in danger? likewise for a """"world environment network"""" to bring together non-governmental agencies, think tanks, universities and businesses, to """"get the creative juices bubbling"""" on innovative solutions to entrenched environmental problems?
at the same time as making the world a better place, we ought to get our own foreign policy system into better shape added to all the bits and pieces that ottawa already has, shouldn't there also be a minister for peace building to promote conflict resolution concepts and projects; an independent global human security policy centre to do independent research and analysis; and a new agency to run a communications and education and public diplomacy on global issues, most especially human rights ones?
phew gasp puff, puff
lloyd axworthy, the former liberal foreign affairs minister, isn't merely a policy wonk he a policy obsessive and not just about the world outside in this book axworthy has a whole lot of thoughts to suggest to domestically minded canadians, from ways to get more immigrants to settle outside the cities to senate reform to more money for multiculturalism to modified proportional representation to improve our parliamentary democracy
all worthy ideas but rude questions readily suggest themselves does axworthy really think that money grows on trees? (as a 's liberal, he probably does) does he really think all his proposed agencies won't turn into bureaucracies just because he sticks into his descriptions of them, like raisins in rice pudding, such buzz words as inclusive, participatory and transparent?
more consequentially, how can anyone seriously propose a new schema for canadian foreign policy without having anything to say about our most important foreign policy by far, namely our relationship with the united states?
on the question of what to do about the -pound gorilla next door, axworthy ideas aren't merely inadequate, they're minuscule first, work more closely with mexico (axworthy has to know that canada and mexico would always put their national interests first, each by doing side deals with the us if necessary also, a pretend alliance between them would merely irritate the gorilla without impeding it in the least) next, open more consulates south of the border (useful, but marginal, although a grand idea for worn-out liberals who would have more patronage posts to look forward to)
it therefore at times hard not to get exceedingly exasperated with axworthy for extended periods, his feet simply don't touch the ground he harbours an ill-concealed anti-americanism, constantly denouncing its militarism while never acknowledging that, as no one else, or indeed all the rest combined not could have done, that its military capability ended the slaughter in bosnia and the ethnic cleansing in kosovo - and further, as an additional side benefit, protects canada for free his constantly chanted mantra - canadian foreign policy good; us bad - feeds our natural inclination to smugness, and plays blatantly to the gallery
yet it even harder not to get exhilarated by axworthy
he was, beyond much argument, our second-best foreign minister, after only lester pearson the land mines treaty, of which he was the godfather, and the international criminal court, of which he was a key promoter, were two of our most creative foreign policy initiatives in decades he ought to have been awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with its solo winner, jodi williams, the leader of the non-governmental anti-land mines movement
he had his liabilities he cheesed off his own diplomats worse than all that mushy """"soft power"""" stuff, to many of them, was that he brought such outsiders as the ngo types into the inner sanctums he also cheesed off anyone in ottawa worried about where the money was coming from he cheesed off the americans (his moralizing caused annoyance in washington long before bush and the neo-cons, whom he detests, took power)
but he projected ideas and he radiated idealism axworthy creeds - """"soft power"""" and """"human security"""" - connected with ordinary canadians and made them feel proud of what was being done in their name as a result, and even if pearson was the original cause, foreign policy is again an integral element in the canadian identity
axworthy book proposes a coherent idea, or set of interconnected ideas, for canadian foreign policy as no one has since pearson did with his notions of peacekeeping and of canada as a """"helpful fixer"""" between the us and europe
more soft power and human security, of course but axworthy magnifies those concepts and gives them a new purposefulness that expressed in his opening sentence: """"canadians are on the road to global citizenship""""
he argues we should lead the way beyond national sovereignty and the presumption that nation-states exist to look only after their own citizens the rallying cry is """"global duty""""
we canadians must embrace it, and seek to enlist others as allies in the cause: """"the international system centered on traditional domestic and sovereign concerns is poorly governed when it comes to the protection of individuals and it is no longer perceived as offering hope to the majority of global citizens who seek escape from the fear of want and the fear for life""""
we should embrace it also because we are, well, canadians to this enlightened task we can offer precious little hard power, but lots of """"ideas, skills, resources, a political commitment to working with others to find practical, peaceful solutions and a sense of quiet optimism about the future""""
all his specific ideas, such as an r- and for a minister of peace building to be added to the cabinet in ottawa, are attempts to realize this dream - or, in his closing phrase, steps """"toward a horizon where justice, security and fairness beckon""""
some part of this is dreamily impractical much of foreign affairs is, must be, about the hard stuff; not just the military but the economic, the financial, the trade axworthy is really only interested in the third world: europe scarcely gets mentioned and the us constantly gets bashed
power does matter, whether of cruise missiles or of suicide bombs money does matter: it is concentrated in north america and europe (and japan and a few other places) and constantly lecturing them isn't going to open any doors for those most in need of help just look at what happened - nothing - at the recent trade meetings in cancun that was supposed to help third world farmers
ultimately, perhaps, the dream itself matters axworthy dream would turn on huge numbers of our young people, and no less many ordinary canadians of all ages and backgrounds and stations in life it would give us a new sense of our national distinctiveness his vision deserves a careful hearing by canadians, by ottawa - and by paul martin

The owner of the agency that brought him into the country, Cecilia Agtarap, assured him she'd find him another job, that she'd look after him. The next day, in the basement under Agtarap's Eglinton office, he began to worry. Agtarap told Calicdan his employer put her elderly mother into a nursing home and did not need his services any more. Calicdan convinced three caregivers to come forward and file complaints against Agtarap. """"I told them that I talked to RCMP. We can help each other.""""","on his first night in canada, three years ago, jesus calicdan
jr found himself in a basement beneath a business on eglinton ave
w a dozen caregivers surrounded him on beat-up couches and
mattresses on the floor
a few approached him, asked him where he was from - the
philippines - and asked him how much he paid - $, (us) - to
work in toronto
most of the caregivers were women one was crying
""""(she'd) stayed there for too long, begging for work,"""" recalls
calicdan, now  """"but no work for six months""""
they all told him one basic truth he was about to experience
things he would not like and then, they told him to keep quiet
""""they were afraid  somebody might be deported""""
the next day, calicdan found out his employer didn't need him any more the owner of the agency that brought him into the country, cecilia agtarap, assured him she'd find him another job, that she'd look after him
""""don't worry,"""" agtarap told him he remembers hearing the same refrain every day for the next three months calicdan worried he was being deceived and tried to think of a way out
for what felt like a very long time, he had no choice but to continue living with the others in the apartment under the agency, crying and listening to the others cry
people seeking to apply for canada's live-in caregiver program
pay thousands of dollars to canadian agencies in exchange for a
promise they will find you an employer
often, those agencies fulfil that promise and the caregiver feels she got her money's worth
but sometimes that doesn't happen sometimes caregivers get
cheated employers terminate the caregivers' contracts before they
arrive and then agencies refuse to give refunds or simply vanish
with the cash
sometimes caregivers like calicdan make it all the way to canada, only to find that there is no employer and nowhere for them to live
they don't want to stay at the agency or with friends for long
because the clock is ticking under the program, they have three
years to complete two years of live-in work to qualify for permanent residency
they have mortgaged homes, borrowed from loan sharks, scraped
together their life savings and given all of their money to
agencies and unscrupulous agencies can take the money and leave
them with nothing - because no one is watching
advocacy groups, enforcement officers and lawyers say agencies
are free to do what they want no regulatory body governs them
and they don't need a licence to operate they used to be
licensed by the ontario labour ministry, but in , the
province did away with the regulatory act that prevented or
limited agencies from charging a fee to individuals seeking jobs
police investigate agencies running scams - some pay fake
employers to apply for nannies that they don't need advocacy
groups and the philippine consulate field calls from women crying
about greedy agencies everyday, people pay and because so many
agencies are now charging the nannies, more established agencies -
which charge the families doing the hiring - are folding
""""an unbelievable number of agencies can't survive,"""" says marna martin, who has advocated for more integrity in the industry """"how do you compete with free? if you're charging a fee to the families, you're competing against all these other agencies that are charging the girls and placing for free""""
calicdan and his six younger brothers grew up in pangasinan, philippines his mother was the district supervisor of an elementary school, his father a municipal agrarian reform officer his brothers became professionals a lawyer, nurse, certified public accountant, student of mass communication
he graduated with a degree in physical therapy but back home,
it's different, he says """"if you're a certified public
accountant, if you're a department head, you're going to earn
, pesos a month or (less than) $,"""" he says
one day, he saw an ad in a newspaper """"canada wants you!""""
""""my friends said canada is a peaceful and good country and of
course, it's a winter country i said, why not try?"""" he took an
hour-long bus ride to a nearby town, moncada, to enrol at the
toronto family health care school for six months
""""they told me, if you enrol in this program and you decide to go
to canada - if you pay $, - you're going to have an employer
within  hours because we have a partner in toronto""""
the manager of the training centre referred him to cecilia agtarap, , who runs cecilia agtarap & associates agtarap, who
was born in moncada, founded the health-care school its main
branch is in toronto
calicdan's family sold a hectare of land and he used all his savings to pay the fee on aug , , the affable, soft-spoken man arrived at pearson airport with two pieces of luggage and $ (us) in his pocket
the next day, in the basement under agtarap's eglinton office, he began to worry agtarap told calicdan his employer put her elderly mother into a nursing home and did not need his services any more
he tried to stay calm """"back home, if you're a very expressive guy, maybe one day you'll be killed""""
but calicdan was running out of money and he was not allowed to
work in canada even if he found a new employer, he couldn't work
until human resources and skills development canada granted him a
new work permit; that could take months
so while he was waiting for an employer, he had eyes for everything he took in every detail he was planning to save himself and his friends
not so long ago, agencies were under close scrutiny the province watched them, kept them from charging caregivers or controlled how much they could charge under the employment agencies act, ontario agencies were charged $ for a licence and a book was published of licensed agencies
if the labour ministry thought your business would be unlawful,
dishonest or unethical, if it thought you had money troubles, it
could refuse to issue a licence, ministry spokesperson belinda
sutton says
the act was eliminated, effective march ,  she says the
ministry felt regulating agencies fell outside its mandate
""""the relationship between job applications and placement agencies is commercial in nature, relating to the provision of services, and is not an employment relationship""""
sutton says people who have complaints about agencies concerning bias or harassment can contact the ontario human rights commission
martin, of the canadian coalition for in-home care, a lobby group comprising caregivers, employers and agencies, says the deregulated industry is a horror story
""""what they wanted was for the agencies to start self-policing
but you can't self-police this one,"""" says martin, president of
oakville-based trafalgar personnel """"it's almost depressing for
people who've been working in the caregiver industry there are so many agencies processing people to come into false jobs and people sponsoring their family members the caregivers are paying ridiculous amounts of money""""
donald mills, who helps his sister operate caregivers of canada ltd, says since agencies were deregulated, his sister's -year- old business has suffered
""""it's killed legitimate businesses,"""" mills says from his oakville office """"a lot of good businesses have closed down it seems to be survival of the worst
""""the fact that put us off is that the agencies are bleeding the girls,"""" he says """"some of these agencies promise the girls the moon if they come here""""
legitimate agencies in ontario say they receive much unsolicited e-mail from foreign agents - especially those based in hong kong they offer steep commissions (often $, or more) for placing each caregiver """"there is no problem on recruiting the filipina maids in
hong kong because all want to work and stay in canada,"""" says a
letter from mandy tsang, director of the yichi service employment
company in hong kong
the letter also spells out how that commission would be received
payment due soon after the nanny touches down mills says he
received an e-mail from an israeli agency offering $, per
caregiver placed """"where do you think that money comes from?"""" he
says """"the girls"""" his agency charges the employer $,, while
other agencies don't have such a fee
a random telephone survey of about a dozen agencies in toronto
resulted in a range of practices and much confusion about what is
allowed some say it's illegal to charge the caregivers, while
others say employers should not have to pay
in most cases, caregivers pay agencies a few thousand dollars
calicdan says he doesn't exactly remember when he decided to go the police
""""i knew everyone around there was crying, crying, crying i told myself that i needed to do something"""" a friend referred him to inspector rick moss, an rcmp diversity liaison officer
""""he had quite a story,"""" moss remembers the friendly, easygoing officer has been with the mounties for  years """"he didn't know what to do""""
moss met with him """"i think he felt helpless initially i
remember telling him that he hadn't done anything wrong and that
we would try to help him
""""i really felt sorry for those guys they're such nice kids they just wanted to come here and do well""""
moss contacted constable paul hayle, who investigates violations
of the immigration act he arranged a meeting a week later and
sat in to make calicdan feel more comfortable
hayle had been in the department for about eight months when he first met calicdan on dec ,  they met at toronto police  division, down the street from agtarap's business
""""jesus  is very well-educated he's no dummy,"""" hayle says
""""the whole idea was to come to canada, work for a couple years
and send money back to his family it took a lot of guts on his
part (to speak out) he was pretty angry he brought forward a
lot of other people""""
calicdan convinced three caregivers to come forward and file complaints against agtarap """"i told them that i talked to rcmp we can help each other""""
one of the first caregivers he asked to join his fight was jaycen
olavario he told -year-old olavario to meet him at another
agency, and when olavario showed up, calicdan was waiting with a
police officer
""""we were sort of relieved that somebody started it,"""" olavario says """"we have nothing to lose we've already lost a lot, we have nothing else
""""we came here to have a better future to put in so much effort
and so much money to the point where you are buried in debt just
to pay the fee, and to find out that you don't have a permanent
job? and how hard it was to explain to our family that  we
would not be able to help them pay back the money they borrowed,
the interest, the principal they, too, were struggling back
home it was so hard""""
calicdan moved into the home of a woman who ran another agency police investigated agtarap for more than a year, including taking victim statements and searching her office
agtarap was charged with  offences under the immigration act
involving  caregivers the charges included inducing third parties
to sponsor caregivers from abroad (sometimes by paying them) and
making false promises of employment
an agreed statement of facts says fake employers signed bogus applications - blank applications - in exchange for money - in one case $,
in a plea bargain, she pleaded guilty to three counts, and last march she was placed on probation for  months, ordered to perform  hours of community service and fined $,
agtarap says all the allegations against her are false, adding
she pleaded guilty to avoid any more pain """"i could not pay my
lawyer any more, so that's why i accepted the fault i didn't
want any more stress""""
she says all she wanted to do was help people """"i helped (caregivers) once they came, i gave them lodging once i gave them a job, they're not happy""""
agtarap allowed nannies to stay in the basement of her business - her daughters stayed there as well, she says - because sometimes employers no longer required their services or the caregivers simply did not like working there
and because the live-in caregiver program requires that the
employee """"live in"""" with the employer, being out of a job means
you're effectively homeless agtarap says she was simply trying to
help them until a new employer could be found she's also rescued
caregivers from other agencies who've housed them without food, she says
other jealous agencies manipulated caregivers into reporting her to police, agtarap says
""""this is not fair i'm the only one who is accused for this i
told myself, 'god knows everything' i don't want to cry any
more now it's very painful  you do good today and they will
forget tomorrow""""
her family's companies, the sisters employment and paralegal services inc and northern star immigration and legal services inc, still operate on eglinton ave w, according to government corporate
registries her daughters are listed as directors of these
businesses since the court case, she's handed her businesses over
to her daughters, friends and family and closed down one of her
schools she says she helps out there once in awhile
since agtarap's case concluded, hayle has transferred to the
drugs section, but he still gets calls from caregivers saying
they've been cheated by agencies moss is working on the
ipperwash inquiry
their colleagues are now busy investigating other dishonest
agencies they run scams in which they apply to the human resources
department on behalf of unaware or fake employers or they pay
employers to apply for foreign caregivers
a spokesperson for the department says according to its guidelines, every employer is directly contacted to prevent fraudulent applications
corporal tom baldwin, with the rcmp's milton branch, has worked
on several investigations this year, and has received complaints
from the public about people's names being used on applications
for caregivers without their knowledge
he says there are likely more cases of caregiver abuse that no
one hears about """"you get a lot of people who are defrauded in
foreign countries, so we can't do anything about it""""
baldwin says many cases involving caregivers and agencies tread a fine line between civil and criminal matters """"there's no regulation
to say what the price is to do so and so"""" he says cases of human
trafficking and the smuggling of migrants are the rcmp's top
priority
toronto lawyer jess antonio sues agencies that exploit women
he's working on  cases in small claims court """"they charge
these caregivers money and they don't provide a service,"""" he
says """"these girls come from third world countries and for these
agencies to charge them a couple thousand dollars, that's a whole
year's pay""""
rolando rico olalia, the consular officer in labour for the
philippine consulate-general in toronto, says he documents the names
of dishonest agencies and notifies the labour department in the
philippines he says he also answers e-mails from women in the
philippines asking to check the legitimacy of canadian agencies, but he's not sure how to do so
advocacy groups and agencies say some caregivers who come here
and don't find jobs go underground """"a lot of jobs they come for
are phony jobs, so they come into canada  and float around
looking for work,"""" says mills """"they call us day in and day out
looking for work the pool of legitimate girls is getting less
and less""""
the lack of enforcement and clear regulations governing agencies allows some unscrupulous agencies to take advantage of people like calicdan and many others interviewed few victims dare to speak almost all who do, do so on the condition of anonymity they fear reprisal and deportation
some go on to find other jobs and focus on finishing the live-in caregiver program, pushing the bad experiences to the back of their minds
calicdan found a job caring for a -year-old man with
alzheimer's in february,  he's applied for landed-immigrant
status and is awaiting approval word is expected any day now
he's also taking a physiotherapy course
he doesn't smile when he talks about his experiences involving agtarap but he does when he talks about his wife and their recent wedding in june, he married one of the women he met while staying with agtarap their wedding portrait hangs on the wall of his room in his employer's apartment
also on his wall is a poem """"life is a gift, accept it  life is a tragedy, face it life is a journey, complete it""""
he hopes his fight will inspire others """"we did this because a
lot of people are in the same boat we fought for ourselves and
for those who are applying to canada and who will be victimized
by agencies""""

1512673831,The key to Canada's immigration success,"The ad targeted skilled foreign workers who were having a hard time navigating the unwelcoming U.S. visa system. The billboard I saw near Silicon Valley was there to attract workers on temporary visas, precisely the people who are having a hard time finding a pathway to U.S. citizenship.","  last may, i was driving on highway , which links san francisco and silicon valley, when i noticed a billboard inviting temporary migrants in the united states to apply to move to canada the ad targeted skilled foreign workers who were having a hard time navigating the unwelcoming us visa system
the sign grabbed my attention personally and professionally i immigrated to canada at a young age, spent my formative years in toronto, saskatoon and montreal, and hold a canadian passport today i'm chair of canadian studies at the university of california, berkeley, and do research on immigration that billboard, paid for by the government of canada, is a great illustration of the strengths of canada's immigration system but it also holds some warnings for what might go wrong in the future
immigration and integration in canada are a success story by many measures each year, canada admits hundreds of thousands of migrants at rates among the highest in the western world the vast majority of those we admit as permanent residents become citizens quickly, at levels far higher than in the united states, france or germany
in addition, canadians overwhelmingly see migration as a good thing about two-thirds of canadians feel immigration is a key positive feature of the country, and canadians who identify themselves as patriotic are also the most likely to support immigration and multiculturalism this is in contrast to countries such as the united states, france and the united kingdom, where residents have much more mixed feelings about immigration
canada owes its exceptionalism in large part to government policy, which has made it a priority to integrate immigrants into society for decades, canada's policy has focused on providing immigrants with permanent residence, supportive institutions, and a clear path to citizenship a path to citizenship is not only about fairness, but it brings immigrants fully into the nation, generating mutual obligations and support between new and established canadians
as the number of temporary migrants to canada rises and the government contemplates policy changes that might make it harder for immigrants to gain citizenship, it is important to understand why canada's immigration policy has been such a success so far
much of the ill feeling towards immigrants in the us and many european countries is rooted in legacies of temporary and clandestine migration temporary immigration without a clear road to citizenship is bad for immigrants and for the countries where they live
based on the experience of other countries, we know that temporary migration leads to people overstaying visas and becoming """"undocumented"""" european countries that imported temporary labourers from turkey, morocco and other countries to help re-build the continent after the second world war quickly found that migrants stay
migrants develop ties in local communities, some fall in love and start families, and employers do not necessarily want to give up experienced workers moral questions also arise when you see a worker as little more than a piece of machinery, something to shut down - and send home - when times are tough, and activate again when economic conditions improve
the united states faces the same challenge today it finds itself economically dependent on lowskilled undocumented labour, and high-skilled temporary labour, but the country is unwilling to provide paths to citizenship to these workers given this, the rapid rise in temporary migration within canada's immigration program raises significant concerns in a -year period from  to , the number of temporary workers in canada increased from under , to almost ,, according to citizenship and immigration canada the number is likely over half a million now while a small number, just over , people in , can transition to permanent residency, most have no avenue to make a long-term home in canada
in april , the first batch of temporary workers subject to a four-year limit on their work in canada will face the prospect of being forced to return to their home countries many will go without having been given the opportunity to contribute economically, socially, culturally or politically to the country over the long term for others, the incentives to stay in the country where they have begun building their lives will be great
the billboard i saw near silicon valley was there to attract workers on temporary visas, precisely the people who are having a hard time finding a pathway to us citizenship canada wanted to offer them a better option we need to make sure that option exists for temporary workers already in canada, too
immigrants are people and canada needs people, not just workers or entrepreneurs this idea should be front and centre as politicians and canadians consider the country's immigration and settlement policies

so we've had cincinnati-style chili (served on spaghetti and with a heap of shredded cheddar on top) from camp washington in cinci we went to lafayette coney island for hotdogs served with mustard, onions and chili in detroit, and hit up a detroit-style pizza (square, with a deep, thick crust) as well we had wings at one joint and beef on weck in another in buffalo, schwartz's smoked meat in montreal, various poutines in quebec city, brauts and pretzels in milwaukee, deep dish pizza and italian beef sandwiches in chicago and in new york, we had pastrami and an egg cream from katz's, pizza and hotdogs all over the place and italian ices from streetside stands
seldom are these civic identity foods fancy some of them aren't even all that good but they're legitimately part of the culture of the cities we've eaten them in, and i can't say we've ever regretted any of these stops
but what about toronto? it's hard, famously hard, to say what our signature dish would be the question comes up now and again, and i've been thinking about it and asking people about it for a few months it was discussed on cbc's metro morning again the other day - and their panel initially settled on the answer that we don't have a signature dish which may be the right answer, at least partly, at least not yet
if you'd asked me a few years ago, i would have answered without thinking: peameal bacon this is """"hogtown,"""" after all, that bacon is where we got the name, and it's a food they don't really eat at all in other big cities, at least not outside of canada
i grew up in a household with a mother who would bring back whole uncut loins of peameal from st lawrence market to have on hand for breakfasts, lunches and snacks it is an amazing food
and when you're at the market buying it, you stop at carousel bakery and get heaping slices of it on a soft kaiser roll - just that, no condiments, no toppings it needs nothing salt and softness, cornmeal and crust, and pork this is toronto's sandwich, obviously
in july , mayor john tory declared that sandwich toronto's signature dish, so i'm not saying anything new it's a good answer
but i have been thinking about the criteria that make sense for a local iconic food item, and i think it has to be somewhat unique (or at least uniquely common) locally, which the peameal sandwich is but it also seems like it needs to be widespread in the city - something locals there actually eat regularly and as food writer corey mintz pointed out on the cbc panel, that doesn't really apply here you get peameal sandwiches at the market, and almost nowhere else i like the ones at when the pig came home in the junction, and they make tasty ones with fried onions, cheese, tomatoes, and a fried egg on them at long branch arena (no joke!), but they aren't something you find in every diner and dive across the city sadly there are no peameal-on-a-bun chains many people have never had one, or as mintz said of himself, have only tried one once, like a tourist item
mintz suggested the street meat hotdog, which is something i had been considering as well ours are different (and bigger) than those in other cities, with a range of toppings unique here and because they were our only street food for generations, they are everywhere jamaican patties also come up for consideration regularly - not because they are unique to toronto in any way but because they are beloved and available everywhere from doughnut shops to subway stations
i have heard people suggest that veal on bun is a distinctly toronto thing - the elements of veal parmigiana heaped on a crusty roll with sauce - but i can't determine whether it really is rare outside the city, and the names of the two biggest purveyors of them (california sandwiches and san francesco) suggest some west-coast connection perhaps readers can tell me their experiences
meanwhile, fran's restaurant claims to have invented the banquet burger at yonge and st clair now, whether they were the first to call it that or not, i have to think putting bacon strips on a cheeseburger is something that was bound to become common in any event and is common, across the continent
i considered whether there was a toronto-style pizza, and stopped the train of thought when it dawned on me that the doughy mediocrity of pizza pizza is it swiss chalet chicken with its red sauce and tim horton timbits - both from chains founded in or near toronto and now dominant in the market - probably have unheralded claims, though few want to make them loudly
on some fundamental level, the problem is that these are not the things that spring to mind when you think of toronto and food because our food scene is so much better and more varied than chain-store chicken: you think of kimchi and sushi and roti and dim sum you think of how if you pick any cuisine from around the world, you can find an outstanding example of it here
which may be, strangely, why it's hard to figure out a signature dish three different experts i spoke to about culture and cuisine - writer david sax who chronicled the rise and fall of the jewish deli in his book save the deli, anthropologist and food researcher dylan gordon of u of t, and shyon bauman who researches the sociology of food at u of t - all independently suggested that the diversity of the city's culture is why we don't have any (or many) singular foods that stand out as reflecting our culture because we're not a monoculture
""""toronto, as we all know, has a diversity of food because of our strong history of immigration so, instead of an iconic food in particular, toronto is known for having a rich diversity of foods connected to ethnic communities,"""" bauman wrote in an email
gordon, noting that our pride in our cultural diversity is not something we always live up to in practice, even suggested the lack of any dominant food item might be an asset, symbolically """"i think toronto does have a unique food culture: a very diverse one and it reflects the imagined diversity of our community so there isn't just one toronto food there are many of them vying to represent who we think we are, and the lack of one that stands above the others is maybe a nice vision of how we imagine and aspire to a culture and politics built on difference instead of similarity""""
what i wonder is whether, in time, this will give rise to new toronto versions of the many food cultures we enjoy jewish deli foods in montreal and new york, after all, emerged as local variations on a larger, older culture pizza, in all its north american incarnations, represents local evolutions of an italian dish the curries that are the most common dishes in london, england today bear little relation to those found in india, but were certainly based on them
sax suggested to me that perhaps over time we'd see dishes and menus emerge that were like a drake mixtape, showing influences from different styles and genres from the us and caribbean and places beyond, and references to forest hill and weston and other neighbourhoods, adding bits and pieces from here and there - as unself-consciously mixed and matched as his hometown
i'm not widely travelled enough to know if local variations and mash-ups are already emerging here - not as one-off experiments but as toronto standard dishes are there variations of popular dishes served here that have become substantially different from their ancestors around the world? is there a toronto-style pot-sticker, or a scarborough-style dhal, or some distinct etobicoke roll maki? is there a common way of making roti or tartare or pasta here that would be considered instantly recognizable as our own?
if you're familiar with dishes that might fit that description - or have thoughts on what stands out to you as the toronto signature dish - i'd love to hear them you can email me at ekeenan@thestarca as i say, it's a topic that comes up a lot, so it's useful to have notes to refer to besides, my kids are obsessed with trying famous foods from various cities it would be great to let them try a few more of our own

wilson -month-old son andrew became so excited after the swearing-in ceremony for new recruits that he grabbed his mother cap and began waving it about but andrew was soon distracted and began playing with some stacking chairs
wilson took her oath in the gymnasium at ottawa police headquarters with  other recruits nine of the new officers are women and seven are members of visible minorities in accordance with the police department employment equity program which began in  they begin work as police officers immediately
the ontario police act requires municipal police forces to present plans this spring, showing how their membership will become more like that of the communities they serve that means recruiting more women, visible minorities, native canadians and the handicapped
years of secretarial work convinced wilson she needed something more challenging than office routine so, in , the -year-old metcalfe woman began working in the police communications centre
''i was always changing jobs looking for something more interesting,'' wilson said ''then i began working on the  system
''it was a lot like reading a book without seeing the last few pages i never found out what happened to people''
so wilson decided to take the next step and train as an officer
''now i will get to help people and see things through''
the recruits have spent seven weeks on the road observing other police officers and nine weeks at the ontario police college in aylmer, ont the classes weren't physically difficult, wilson said, but street-patrol training brought the recruits face-to-face with real police situations

It really about the difference between understanding the jokes and actually living the experience if you had an Italian grandmother in the house, he adds.","  joe avati, a nice boy, the son of italian parents living in sydney, australia was well on his way to career in food science, when a very funny thing happened
a few years ago at a fundraising event, he cracked a joke about his """"nonna"""" and his """"nonno"""" -- his grandparents -- and got big laughs he liked the feeling, and he began to work on an act that drew on his life growing up in an italian neighbourhood, picking up on the idiosyncrasies of the calabrese, the southern italians
the act connected with many of australia  million italians, and soon he was performing his routines fulltime, making a decent living
then something even funnier happened avati placed a few choice italian stories on the internet, bits about shouting into the telephone when calling relatives in italy, or his nonno getting into a car accident, or using microwaves """"justa for defrosta""""
before long, joe avati was the talk of a new, younger generation of italians -- and not just in australia anymore, but around the world

""""it been overwhelming,"""" says avati, dubbed the """"italian seinfeld"""" for his role as italy funniest male comedian since roberto benigini
the accolades and recognition are fine, he says, but what pleasing him more is that his comedy is bringing italian families together
""""i've been able to reunite the italian community  because young children who have lost touch with their culture are now back into it because it cool to be italian,"""" he says
his comedy is specific to southern italians and sicilians, many of whom emigrated to north america and relate to avati stories about fitting into an english-speaking culture he never performed in italy and doubts italians would """"get"""" his act because he speaks a """"calabrese"""" dialect and because they would be unfamiliar with the experiences of growing up in a multicultural north american society

his act, done in english (laced with an australian accent) and thick calabrian dialect, centres on universal experiences and consists of jokes, impersonations of family members, voices, songs and word play he throws out words and phrases that are familiar to calabrese, such as """"the basement"""" becomes """"basomento"""", """"a bag"""" is """"baga"""" and """"corner store"""" is turned into """"storo""""

239737320,We must close the floodgate of CANADIAN IMMIGRATION Series: BALANCING THE MOSAIC:   [Final Edition ],"Canada can absorb many immigrants because it is so big. This is the most widespread, and the most foolish, of all immigration myths. It has been more than 70 years since immigrants came to settle empty land in Canada. Today, all immigrants go to big cities because that is where the jobs are and where other people of similar backgrounds live. Immigration brings in skilled people we need but don't produce ourselves. Just when industry is desperate for highly skilled workers (and offers fewer opportunities than ever for the unskilled), we find ourselves with an immigration system that, in effect, gives priority to uneducated people. Immigrants, as of the 1986 census, were three times as likely to be functionally illiterate (i.e., have less than Grade 5 education) as native born Canadians. Yet in 1971, immigrants were three times as likely as those born in Canada to have a higher education. We should stop looking at immigration as an economic panacea; it isn't. Nor should we view immigration as a demographic necessity; there will be no demographic disaster if we have much less of it. Instead, we should celebrate immigration as a reaffirmation of who we are -- a nation of immigrants.","  this article is an excerpt from toronto journalist daniel stoffman special atkinson charitable foundation report pounding at the gates, a study of canada immigration systemthe world is on the move by some estimates, as many as  million people from poor countries want to make new homes in the exclusive club of rich countries, a club that includes canada but the rich countries can't employ or accommodate more than a small fraction of them
heartless as it may seem, the rich countries don't need these people and aren't going to let them in
yet through the s and beyond, an ever-growing tide of people from the poor nations will be pounding on the gates of the rich
four babies are born every second in less than two decades, the third world labor force will contain  million more people than it does today, an increase equal to the existing labor force of all the world industrialized countries
because of television and movies, people who live in the teeming cities of the third world know that a better life awaits them in the rich countries if they can only get through those gates you can't blame them for trying all they want is what the immigrant ancestors of today canadians wanted -- a better life for their children
they want it so badly that if one rich country refuses them entry, they will try another one place many will be sure to try is canada
canadian immigration policy used to be about seeking immigrants to populate a new country that was in the process of nation-building it not about that any more, although many people still think of it in these archaic terms
immigration policy today is about finding a way to cope with the swelling tide of humanity that wants in it is in canada best interest to select only a few of the millions of people who would like to come here -- the ones most likely to become productive members of canadian society
that is why parliament recently approved a new immigration law that includes measures aimed at giving the government more control over who gets in and that is why policy-makers in canada and other rich countries are belatedly waking up to the need to plan third world development aid with the aim of curbing migration by creating jobs in those countries
it is clear that we must buy the goods and services that the poor countries are offering or they will send us their excess populations this new global setting provides an entirely new context for canadian immigration policy a national debate is long overdue
yet, until recently, there has been little debate over immigration policy in canada this is surprising because the current five-year plan calling for canada immigration of  million people represents canada largest wave of newcomers since the turn of the century
except for the special case of israel, no other country in the world receives immigrants on a scale even close to ours
it hard to have a dispassionate and serious discussion on this vital issue that because, more than any other area of public policy, immigration is encrusted with empty rhetoric, emotionalism, exaggerated claims and quaint, romantic notions that simply don't make any sense
both those who favor canada policy of massive, unselective immigration and those who are against non-white immigration and multiculturalism rely on a variety of myths to bolster their arguments
some of these ideas hark back to canada pioneer days before we can even start to talk about immigration policy in the 's, we need to reassess these outdated ideas
here are a few of them:
*
canada can absorb many immigrants because it is so big this is the most widespread, and the most foolish, of all immigration myths it has been more than  years since immigrants came to settle empty land in canada today, all immigrants go to big cities because that is where the jobs are and where other people of similar backgrounds live
*
immigration brings in skilled people we need but don't produce ourselves just when industry is desperate for highly skilled workers (and offers fewer opportunities than ever for the unskilled), we find ourselves with an immigration system that, in effect, gives priority to uneducated people immigrants, as of the  census, were three times as likely to be functionally illiterate (ie, have less than grade  education) as native born canadians yet in , immigrants were three times as likely as those born in canada to have a higher education
*
immigration is essential to the economy there is no evidence that this is true in fact, there is a consensus among economists who have studied immigration that it does nothing to raise the incomes of those already here
*
immigrants cause unemployment and are a drain on social services wrong in the past, immigrants have contributed more to the public coffers in taxes than they have taken out studies have shown time and again that, while immigration may depress wages and cause unemployment in certain industries, it has no permanent impact on the over-all unemployment rate
*
canada is under-populated the issue is not whether canada is under-populated but whether metro toronto and other large cities are under-populated because that is where immigrants settle our cities are undergoing unprecedented stress -- homelessness, food banks, violent crime, traffic congestion, air pollution, overflowing landfill sites is more population the answer to these problems?
*
immigrants form ethnic ghettos and refuse to adopt canadian cultural values this is a crude overstatement new immigrants have always been """"different; succeeding generations have always integrated and it still happening
*
canada requires immigrants to pass a points test to show they have useful skills rarely in fact, fewer than  per cent need to prove any kind of worthiness, compared with  per cent  years ago by encouraging family reunification beyond the immediate family, even before immigrants have obtained citizenship, the federal government has created a stream of self-selected immigrants who don't need to speak one of our languages or have any education or skills to enter canada by right
*
immigration is diluting the canadian national identity if canadians have only a frail sense of national identity, that is not the fault of immigrants most new canadians are ready and willing to accept the canadian identity as their own but first we have to articulate clearly, both for their sake and our own, what that identity is
*
because of our low fertility rate, canada population is shrinking and we need more immigrants to fill jobs wrong because we have so many women of child-bearing age, our population would be growing even without any immigration canada, according to the most recent statistics canada demographic report, has """"the strongest rate of population growth in the industrialized world
*
if we don't have a lot of immigration, our population will go down eventually because canadians aren't producing enough babies to replace the existing population of  million this is true, but what does it really mean? it means that because a couple now in their s decides to have only one child, the canadian population will eventually decline by one but that decline won't likely happen for at least another  years when the mother and father die in an over-populated world, there are far more pressing things to worry about than that anyway, no one can prove that a canada of  million people in the middle of the next century would be worse off than a canada of ,  or  million
*
without high immigration, there won't be enough young people to pay for the social programs to support all the old people we are going to have as society ages this is most unlikely european countries already have the high percentage of older people that we will have in the next century and they are doing fine
*
a tidal wave of people is on the move and you can't stop a tidal wave yes you can, if you decide you really want to italy sent back boatloads of albanians and the albanians stopped coming when the west said it would no longer accept vietnamese refugees and proved it by forcibly repatriating them from camps in hong kong, the boat people stopped coming
once we've dispensed with the mythology what are we left with? well, we're left with , people a year leaving crowded cities in other countries to come to crowded cities in canada we know why they want to come: most will enjoy a better standard of living and a lot of them have relatives here
what in it for us?
why do we want to cram so many new people, half of whom can't speak either official language, into our largest cities every year?
defenders of the existing policy argue that rapid population growth is essential for economic growth by this analysis, the citizens of china and india should be the richest people on earth while those who live in small countries with stable populations -- switzerland and the netherlands, for example -- should have starved to death long ago
the truth is that immigration helps some canadians economically, hurts others and makes little difference to the vast majority it time for a more realistic assessment of what immigration can do, both for canada and for the people who want to settle here
immigration is a way of:
*
providing a haven for genuine refugees;
*
getting some capital and useful skills, while keeping in mind that these benefits, though helpful, have no great economic impact;
*
reuniting immediate families, that is, spouses and dependent children
*
preventing too steep a drop in population
we should stop looking at immigration as an economic panacea; it isn't nor should we view immigration as a demographic necessity; there will be no demographic disaster if we have much less of it instead, we should celebrate immigration as a reaffirmation of who we are -- a nation of immigrants
but we should be clear about how immigration is changing the country who we are and who we are becoming is different from who we were
until the s, immigration policy in canada, the us and australia systematically excluded visible minorities then all three immigrant-receiving countries, with canada leading the way, traded in their racist policies for egalitarian ones the implications of that decision were not debated then and, in canada, they still haven't been
the implications are these: the vast majority of the immigrants to canada now are non-white this fact, coupled with a low birthrate and the concentration of immigrants in the largest cities, means that non-whites will eventually become the majority in these cities
when the politicians quietly changed the policy a quarter of a century ago, nobody thought this would happen
in both canada and the us, politicians actually thought they could have a non-racist immigration policy without changing the ethnic makeup of their respective countries most immigration to north america had always been from europe and that was the way it would always be, or so they thought
the thinking in ottawa was the same, recalls orest kruhlak, a political scientist with a special interest in immigration and head of the federal multiculturalism program in vancouver """"the bureaucrats and politicians thought that immigrants would still come from europe,"""" he says
kruhlak, who is of ukrainian background, thinks few canadians are racist but he thinks many are like his -year-old mother-in-law
a sense of unease
like her, they observe our society changing because of non-european immigration and they feel """"a sense of uncomfortableness, a sense of unease""""
an angus reid poll last june found that  per cent of canadians think racism is a serious and escalating problem
even members of minority groups are less comfortable in canada than they were before brian mulroney government decided we needed a huge influx of newcomers a poll by goldfarb consultants this year found that only  per cent of minority group members were """"very satisfied with life in canada, compared with  per cent in  as well,  per cent felt prejudice against them was increasing, compared with  per cent in 
change is always stressful, especially rapid change canadians will have to accept that, in an increasingly multicultural world, the ethnic composition of canada will change
canada three major parties have decided that this majority view should not be permitted to have political expression immigration policy in canada is conducted as if it were none of the public business
instead, it is the preserve of advocacy groups, ethnic communities, politicians representing those communities and lawyers whose livelihood depends on having a large supply of immigrants to represent
we should not smugly assume that canada is immune to the sort of anti-immigrant backlash now under way in europe
the government recent changes are a welcome beginning at restoring an element of national interest to immigration policy but they are only a first step the government still hasn't got around to explaining why canada needs the biggest per capita immigration intake in the world
we might be better off if we scaled down both the size of the immigration program and our expectations of what it can do for us most of all, we need to discard the mythology, drop the name-calling, and have a real debate on how to shape an immigration policy for the st century

If so, the seemingly smooth passage is very different from those of the immigrants whose brief memoirs make up Piece by Piece: Stories about Fitting into Canada, (Puffin, 183 pages, $20, ages 12+), edited by Toronto's Teresa Toten. In """"The Languages I've Learned,"""" Dimitri Nasrallah recalls moving from Beirut to Athens to Dubai until landing in Montreal at age 11 - from Arabic to English and Greek to French. Poetic, wistful and vivid, Nasrallah's story concludes, """"No one ever tells you that fitting in never ends. It happens everywhere I go, or every time I try something new. It is a lifelong struggle. It will happen to you, too."""" Stephie and little sister Nellie are sent from Vienna to Sweden in 1939, two of 500 Jewish children taken into Swedish homes during World War II. While Nellie adapts quickly to her host family, Stephie has a harder time with hers. """"Aunt"""" Marta is strict and unexpressive and Stephie's classmates make life even more miserable when they bully and mock her. Stephie worries about her parents left in Vienna, and can't get used to being less capable than her younger sister.","""""strange and inconvenient things"""" do happen in life, knows jane fielding of polly horvath's northward to the moon (groundwood,  pages, $, ages  to )
at the end of horvath's summery my one hundred adventures (), jane and her family head from their seaside cabin in massachusetts to saskatchewan, where ned, newly found husband and father, has a job teaching french
that seems strange and only slightly inconvenient - until ned's fired because he doesn't know any french but jane is glad to leave the prairies and hit the road again like some adventuresome outlaw even running out of gas on an isolated road in northern bc en route to a problematic bag of money is just an interesting moment in a road trip jane hopes it will lead her back home to the massachusetts shore
a bag of money, ned's magician brother, a mean stallion and a suddenly discovered grandmother are all part of that journey, and what they bring about is hair-raising, thought-provoking and always a surprise but it's inner change that horvath charts so memorably - and not just in jane, who realizes that """"sometimes it is good to have things happen to you outside your control there are parts of yourself you would never discover otherwise""""
that insight works for horvath's adult characters as well they are fitful and complex, forced to adapt to strange, inconvenient adventures that may or may not change them forever
in her rakish, tart and joyous way, bc's horvath blends the comic and the lyrical, the drifting apart of one family and the coming together of another, in this refreshing novel
horvath's characters seem to take a cross-border us-to-canada move without too much cultural stress or rancor is this a reflection of american-born horvath's own experience of living in canada? if so, the seemingly smooth passage is very different from those of the immigrants whose brief memoirs make up piece by piece: stories about fitting into canada, (puffin,  pages, $, ages +), edited by toronto's teresa toten
inspired by the powerful response young immigrants have had to me and the blondes, toten's comic, partly autobiographical novel about an immigrant croatian teen negotiating high school in toronto, toten invited  writers and artists to encapsulate their own memories of immigration from iran, lebanon, india, china, ethiopia, the us, britain and elsewhere, these now-established canadians recall the difficulties and pleasures of finding how and where they fit in their new country
richardo keens-douglas, born in grenada, tells of trying to lose his caribbean lilt and make it in canadian theatre: """"i felt as if i were dragging around two people in this little brown body"""" not until he steps back from the advice of agents, reviewers and """"even well-meaning friends"""" does he find his voice again and his career takes off
he confides: """"my mum was right 'what is for you, is for you,' but you'd better figure out who you are first""""
in """"the languages i've learned,"""" dimitri nasrallah recalls moving from beirut to athens to dubai until landing in montreal at age  - from arabic to english and greek to french poetic, wistful and vivid, nasrallah's story concludes, """"no one ever tells you that fitting in never ends it happens everywhere i go, or every time i try something new it is a lifelong struggle it will happen to you, too""""
keens-douglas and nasrallah could be writing for anyone who's been riddled with self-doubt and feelings of not belonging such moments make piece by piece compelling the anthology's strength lies in its particulars - torture in iran, bombs in beirut, anne of green gables in mumbai, romance in the dept of english at the university of toronto - as well as in its revelations about a common experience of strangeness that spans not just countries of origin and arrival but being a thinking person at all
the trials of being a new arrival are also central in swedish writer annika thor's a faraway island (delacorte,  pages, $, ages  to ), winner of the  batchelder award for an american children's book published in english translation

438538615,Native son tends his flock; Canada appoints its first Inuit Anglican bishop World's largest diocese has 31 far-flung parishes:   [Ontario Edition ],"The trajectory of [Andrew Atagotaaluk]'s life is especially dramatic given he was born in Thom Bay, a remote Arctic camp of three or four nomadic families that engaged in subsistence hunting and got around by dog team. The clans would move camp regularly to shadow herds of caribou, walrus, seal and Arctic hare. Both his parents were born Christian. He estimates 80 per cent of his time will be spent on the road, a long and winding one in these parts. The diocese comprises all of the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Nunavik (Arctic Quebec). The Inuit, who form the majority of Anglicans, tend to live above the tree line. Ten language groups are represented, including English, French, Cree, Dogrib, Gwich'in and three Inuit dialects. Today, Christianity is firmly entrenched in Canada's high Arctic, with many native people in formal leadership roles. Most of the diocese's 17 priests are Inuit. There are a few Gwich'in deacons in the western Arctic.","while most clergy simply get in their car to minister to their flock, bishop andrew atagotaaluk relies on commercial flights, bush plane, boat and snowmobile to do his job in a diocese that occupies more than one-third of canada
stretching across four time zones from the eastern border of the yukon west to the tip of labrador, and north of the th parallel to the most northerly permanent civilian settlement in canada, grise fiord, the anglican church of canada's diocese of the arctic is the world's largest by far at a mind-boggling  million square kilometres ( million square miles), it represents  times the landmass of great britain
despite its immensity, the diocese's population is barely ,- , of those anglican, in  far-flung parishes
""""of course, with modern technology, we can pretty well get by with e-mail and telephone,"""" the soft-spoken atagotaaluk said in a phone interview from his base in the northern quebec town of salluit
""""regular mail has improved a lot, too""""
atagotaaluk's life journey has been described as spanning the stone age to the cyber age
the -year-old clergyman and father of six made headlines this fall when he was installed as the anglican church's bishop of the arctic, the first time the post has been held by an inuk or even by someone born in canada all four of his predecessors were british immigrants
hundreds jammed st jude's cathedral in iqaluit, capital of nunavut, for the installation ceremony the igloo-shaped church features a pulpit designed to resemble a dogsled and a cross made of narwhal tusks
the popular and respected bishop, who was elevated from suffragan, or assistant bishop, feels his heritage puts him in an ideal position to bond with his charges
""""that's going to play a very important part in my ministry,"""" he said """"because i'm a native person, i can relate to their situation, their way of life that's going to help me a great deal""""
he'll need the help, for this is a part of the country caught in a tragic cycle of chronic unemployment, alcohol and solvent abuse, teen suicide, grinding poverty and family violence the eastern arctic has the highest suicide rate in canada
""""a large portion of our ministry will have to do with healing; healing between families, between individuals from times when things were very difficult for native people, before land claims settlements,"""" atagotaaluk said
""""these are areas we really have to look at, and encourage people that healing is the way to find yourself again""""
another challenge is declining numbers more and more anglicans, as well as catholics in the high arctic, are abandoning their denominations in favour of pentecostal churches
the trajectory of atagotaaluk's life is especially dramatic given he was born in thom bay, a remote arctic camp of three or four nomadic families that engaged in subsistence hunting and got around by dog team the clans would move camp regularly to shadow herds of caribou, walrus, seal and arctic hare both his parents were born christian
he attended a residential school run jointly by christian churches and the federal government the legacy of the residential school system continues to be a bitter one in canada: more than , former students have sued the churches and government, alleging they were subjected to systematic emotional, physical and sexual abuse
(last month, the federal government and the anglican church reached a deal to divide liability for the abuse claims ottawa will pay  per cent for all validated sexual and physical abuse claims at anglican indian residential schools the anglican church agreed to pay  per cent, up to a cap of $ million)
but atagotaaluk has mainly positive memories of the schools
""""my experience was very different than (other) native people had maybe at times it was difficult, but it really shaped me i can only say it benefited me a great deal if i had not gone, i'm sure i would not be where i am today""""
he was ordained a deacon in  and a priest the following year, serving several eastern arctic communities from iqualuit to pond inlet he began encountering stories of abuse and despair, and soon felt the onset of burnout
""""i needed a mental rest  time to pull myself together i had a lot of anger but god played an important part in exposing what i needed to be healed from i could never have found out by myself""""
in , atagotaaluk took a leave of absence and worked as a boat inspector and scuba diver for the federal government, returning seven years later as regional bishop of nunavik
he was also part of the team that recently completed a -year project to translate the entire bible into inuktitut
he estimates  per cent of his time will be spent on the road, a long and winding one in these parts the diocese comprises all of the northwest territories, nunavut and nunavik (arctic quebec) the inuit, who form the majority of anglicans, tend to live above the tree line ten language groups are represented, including english, french, cree, dogrib, gwich'in and three inuit dialects
today, christianity is firmly entrenched in canada's high arctic, with many native people in formal leadership roles most of the diocese's  priests are inuit there are a few gwich'in deacons in the western arctic
atagotaaluk sees no conflict between his faith and aboriginal values, believing they actually complement each other """"i think it has a lot to do with your personal relationship with god,"""" he said

He asks the butcher to cut it up. Exiting, he confesses he was worried the meat would be trimmed off the bone. Vij is a big believer in extracting long-simmered flavour from marrow, and in gnawing on a bone with carnivorous pleasure. Canadians are reluctant to dig in that hands-on way. It's considered impolite. Vij's Elegant & Inspired Indian Cuisine by Vikram Vij and [Meeru Dhalwala] (2006, $40) is a large softcover with pretty glossies and a chatty style. It is dedicated to Vij's grandfather, who pestered him to open """"the finest restaurant in the world."""" Vij is working on that. Adapted from Vij's. Indians traditionally eat well-done meat, but that would be a travesty with tenderloin. These steaks can stand on their own. The leftover gravy would make an outstanding soup base. Vij recommends toasting twice the amount of cumin seeds needed here because it's easier to prevent burning. The seeds are toasted to dark brown, but appear black in the gravy. You can buy bottled tamarind paste at an Indian shop or make your own by pushing boiled, dried tamarind through a sieve. (It should be the consistency of baby food.) Ghee is clarified butter; it is sold in many supermarkets.","in kensington market, a warm autumn breeze blows about the scents of spices and fish and coffee the market is rough around the edges but here, vikram vij can combine business with pleasure
""""we need to evolve,"""" says the celebrated indian cook """"our food is complex""""
with legendary line-ups and international attention, vij's restaurant in vancouver has come far from its beginnings as a - seat hole in the wall now, the proprietor is crossing the country to tell everyone about his first cookbook, vij's elegant & inspired indian cuisine, written with wife meeru dhalwala
at kensington, elegance is in short supply but there is plenty of inspiration
vij is at home in house of spice amid the displays of black mustard seeds and fenugreek leaves and asafetida he admires the sulphurous pakistani black salt, which he sprinkles on lassis and salads
he points out the vermicelli, which indians call sevian """"indians do eat noodles,"""" vij says it's just that restaurant-goers expect (and get) naan
at segovia meats, he takes note of the bright green spinach sausages
at perola's, he buys long, thin, yellow chilies yellow! the shopkeeper tells us they are """"ladyfingers,"""" usually grown in thailand or mexico they make a pretty still life on the weigh scale vij plans to experiment with them
with his red shirt, dark curly hair and startling gray-blue eyes set off against coffee-coloured skin, he stood out in the crowd during last week's walkabout the eyes, he suspects, are a greek influence """"going way back""""
raised in amritsar, delhi and mumbai, vij left india at  to study hotel management in salzburg, austria that led to work at european restaurants and hotels, then banff springs hotel
vij is pleased that indian immigrants can feel at home in canada a woman can shop in an indian neighbourhood and not speak more than five words of english, he says she should be able to speak the language, he hastens to add it's just that shopping for familiar foods in one's native tongue is comforting
""""as indian immigrants, we have come so far that we have our own markets, which i'm very proud of,"""" he says
vij's parents swooped down in vancouver in september  to settle him in by december, settled in he was - with a new cafe and a new wife (and cooking partner)
""""my focus was to bring (up)awareness of my cuisine, my culture and where i come from, """" he recalls
that ruled out some of the dishes festering on standard indian menus he has harsh words for """"overspent"""" chicken tikka masala, vindaloos that are more british than basic indian, and abominations like the """"peppery water"""" known as mulligatawny soup
the more he cooked, the further he stepped away from tradition and the indian eatery mainstream you can see that in his recipes today curried chicken liver pate, jalapeno and cumin-spiced paneer and couscous cakes, duck breast in lime leaf curry, pork tenderloin with spinach and fig stew, pan-fried salmon potato cakes, beet and daikon salsa, grilled coconut kale 
""""i don't want to be categorized as an 'ethnic' restaurant,"""" vij says
his direction has made some traditionalists unhappy """"i get the 'why are you messing with it?' kind of thing,"""" vij admits
""""messing with it"""" involves melding the spices and layered flavours of india, french cooking techniques and local ingredients think alberta beef in a demerara and tamarind marinade or grilled asparagus and corn with fenugreek seed curry or even brussels sprouts indians don't usually eat brussels sprouts that didn't stop wife dhalwala from pairing them with bacon and paneer (cheese) in a tomato curry sauce - and pushing it onto the menu
even vij was skeptical """"i fought tooth and nail with her against it,"""" he admits but in the end, she was right
vij is always eager to give her credit he calls their cuisine """"our style""""
theirs was a quick courtship with a lot of telephone wooing the book formally thanks their mothers for setting up an """"arranged love marriage"""" vij, however, describes it as more of an introduction than an arrangement both were divorced and hit it off
they obviously had a lot in common """"our recipes, developed and refined over the past  years, are as close to our heart as our marriage,"""" vij writes
working with his wife and kitchen staff, travelling, visiting restaurants - all are fodder for new ideas but developing recipes is still hard work """"it's like writing music,"""" vij says """"it doesn't happen overnight""""
jan tennant clearly likes his tune as we amble through the market, this familiar face greets him enthusiastically he knows her only as a satisfied customer we know her as a pioneering female news anchor she has retired and moved to vancouver
vij stops at the max & son kosher butcher shop he has spied a leg of goat that would be perfect for a cooking demo that night he asks the butcher to cut it up exiting, he confesses he was worried the meat would be trimmed off the bone vij is a big believer in extracting long-simmered flavour from marrow, and in gnawing on a bone with carnivorous pleasure canadians are reluctant to dig in that hands-on way it's considered impolite
at vij's restaurant, the reluctant are tempted with lamb """"popsicles"""" these tiny, tangy grilled chops are cut from a rack of lamb holding them by the bone and dipping them in a creamy fenugreek sauce is a deeply satisfying eating experience this is the restaurant's most popular dish, so maybe the stodgier canadians are coming around
interacting with diners is a two-way street, though for example, as a north american concession, vij has added five whites and five reds to the menu, and the recipes in his cookbook all come with wine recommendations
indeed, the complex flavours of indian food can be confusing for wine lovers luckily, wine is vij's """"personal passion"""" and he is a certified sommelier with indian food, he favours new world-style wines the whites are young, fresh and bubbly, the reds soft and less tannin-laden
indians normally drink beer or whisky with appetizers, he says, then water when they sit down to the main event """"the best thing to drink with indian food is water,"""" vij says
but no chi-chi water menus or pricey bottles, please just water filtered at his restaurant and plenty of it, free
""""i have a bit of a socialist attitude,"""" vij says """"we don't need to bottle water, air and sun""""
vij's elegant & inspired indian cuisine by vikram vij and meeru dhalwala (, $) is a large softcover with pretty glossies and a chatty style it is dedicated to vij's grandfather, who pestered him to open """"the finest restaurant in the world"""" vij is working on that

437850321,Quebec three emerging solitudes:   [1 Edition ],"There are the two anglophone and francophone silos, or in Jacques Parizeau crude demarcation, pure laine - """"Quebecers of old stock"""" - and the """"ethnics,"""" including the 250,000 Italians, 100,000 Jews, and 60,000 Greeks. (Even [Lucien Bouchard] exploited the division, questioning Jean Charest Quebec credentials, forcing the Liberal leader to go to ridiculous lengths to articulate his loyalty.) Meanwhile, Montreal visible minority communities have been complaining of a steady deterioration in public services and lack of clout in Quebec city. According to the 1996 census, of Quebec 434,000 visible minorities, 401,000 live in Montreal - 75,000 Haitians, 56,000 Chinese, 50,000 South Asians and 48,000 Lebanese among them. Now that Bouchard has won his own mandate - he had inherited the job from Parizeau - he has the chance to get beyond his party tribal tendencies and govern for all of Quebec. He now free to make his case for Quebec on the basis of geography, as he once promised, not on anachronistic notions of ethnicity.","the quebec election
those still fretting over the re-election of the parti quebecois need only remind themselves that the quebec question has been around since confederation, and in its separatist manifestation for at least  years
this is neither to denigrate the perennial quebec quest for greater recognition, power and money, nor the near-nervous breakdowns it causes in the rest of canada it merely acknowledges that monday election is only the latest expression of quebec ambivalence toward canada
thus we now have it that quebecers don't want another referendum but elect a premier who desires one they don't want him to hold one but wouldn't deny him the tool with which to blackmail english canada they bestow more ballots on the anti-referendum liberals than the pq, and triple the vote for a party, action democratique, that advocated an eight-year moratorium on referendums
similarly, quebecers have divided their votes so evenly as to let politicians and commentators draw several contradictory conclusions: lucien bouchard got no mandate to call a referendum but got one to """"create the winning conditions"""" for it; that he will go slow on the secession project or, maybe, he won't; he is a demagogue who only wants to lead the parade regardless of where it goes, or that he the great communicator who personifies the ambiguities of his core constituency
quebecers are as entitled to such confusing messages as are albertans and british columbians to expressing their concomitant isolationism and desire to be decision-makers in ottawa
while far from ideal for purposes of national unity, such regional expressions are at least very canadian and not as cataclysmic as they seem at the moment of their periodic resurgence they are no cause for panic or for a wholesale dismantling of the federal government, as demanded by the likes of preston manning and mike harris, who are joined in an unholy alliance with the separatists to advance their own devolutionary enterprise
a far more contemporary, but less commented on, phenomenon is the emergence of three solitudes within quebec:
there are the two anglophone and francophone silos, or in jacques parizeau crude demarcation, pure laine - """"quebecers of old stock"""" - and the """"ethnics,"""" including the , italians, , jews, and , greeks (even bouchard exploited the division, questioning jean charest quebec credentials, forcing the liberal leader to go to ridiculous lengths to articulate his loyalty)
a new divide is emerging within montreal, between the old anglophones/allophones and the newer minorities
first, about the isolation of , anglophones overwhelmingly federalist and liberal, they are increasingly ignored in any quebec election not only did bouchard and mario dumont not bother to address them, charest didn't either all three concentrated on the  constituencies with francophone majorities and, within them, on the  or so swing ridings
anglophones and allophones may elect mnas, but they get neither the attention nor the proportional influence in the legislature or public policies - on language or schooling or health care or social services or in getting government jobs they have also failed to change the pq deliberate distortions of constitutionally mandated multiculturalism to impose """"french culture"""" on non-francophones
meanwhile, montreal visible minority communities have been complaining of a steady deterioration in public services and lack of clout in quebec city according to the  census, of quebec , visible minorities, , live in montreal - , haitians, , chinese, , south asians and , lebanese among them
they do not feel the english-rights group alliance quebec and the provincial equality party represent them their own advocacy groups and social service agencies have seen drastic cuts lately they have watched helplessly as the pq eliminated or slashed funding for their special needs, such as translators to ensure better minority access to health and other services and their long-standing calls for fairer access to training grants and jobs continue to be ignored
as far back as , the then pq government had pledged to increase minority representation in provincial jobs from  per cent to  per cent yet today, according to the montreal-based centre for research on race relations, minorities make only  per cent of the province ,-strong civil service
now that bouchard has won his own mandate - he had inherited the job from parizeau - he has the chance to get beyond his party tribal tendencies and govern for all of quebec he now free to make his case for quebec on the basis of geography, as he once promised, not on anachronistic notions of ethnicity

it is worse that nations such as russia conspire to encourage and protect them, and so terribly sad that the olympic movement all too often does not have the moral fibre to stand up for clean athletes by seriously punishing those nations who are at the centre of this dirty business clean sports advocates like scott deserve strong admiration and support from all of us who love sport

to speak french isn't fair
do better on language, dec 
the vast canadian """"other"""" speaks canadian, not english the insistence that canadians should incorporate french as a condition for full citizenship in the halls of government is unfair the millions upon millions of immigrants who arrived without a common language became one with a language common to all
the insistence that they should now speak french, a language of little importance globally, is nothing more than a make-work project in canada and a means of social control anyone who espouses official bilingualism is bigoted to the true canadian ideal of equality the fact that the star does not publish in french reveals the flag of convenience nature of its editorial stance talk is cheap

mpps aren't paid enough? they must do more to earn it
it's time to pay mpps more money, regg cohn, dec 
you must be joking? i cannot shed a tear for someone making $, a year while doing something that they love do these politicians not get a housing allowance? do they not get $, a month when they leave public office? i understand some take home six-figure amounts
i wouldn't mind paying them the money if they were solving society's problems but we still have poverty, crimes in our streets, etc there are struggling people for whom just getting by is an achievement
i wonder how many of our politicians know poverty, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness maybe if our politicians experienced the other side, they would not impose cuts on our vulnerable and, maybe, they would be entitled to these pay raises if your columnist and others who feel sympathetic to the financial situations of our mpps, maybe they should donate some of their salaries to them or start a telethon or charity to help them
pay raises for our mpps are not entitlements

legalizing drugs might not solve the """"opioid crisis,"""" but it certainly won't exacerbate it what it would do is decriminalize drug addiction and save taxpayers a small fortune in unnecessary policing, freeing up police to focus on more pressing things like cyber crime, child exploitation, etc no one wakes up in the morning and says, you know what i'd like to do today with my life, become a drug addict mental illness, physical abuse and poor education with no job prospects are why people turn to drugs fix some of that and you'll be on the right track staying the course is admitting defeat

the free annual festival, now in its th year, returns sept  and attracts more than , book aficionados to harbourfront centre ( queens quay w), its home since  where the peaceful waterfront backdrop enhances the leisurely atmosphere of the day
this year, the word on the street is delivering a strong presence of acclaimed canadian guests, with david suzuki, emma donoghue, anne michaels and ron sexsmith among them putting homegrown talent in the spotlight is part of word's overall mission - one that aims to build a narrative around canuck writers, bring them exposure, and champion their works, explains festival director, heather kanabe
""""canadian authors do not have the marketing budgets of their american contemporaries, and local touch points like bookstores are fewer than in the past,"""" says kanabe """"we have a unique opportunity to platform canadian authors and expand their reach, beyond niche literary audiences  as a tourist event, the festival reaches an international audience""""
this year kanabe had the opportunity to interview a number of recent immigrants for internship positions she says a common theme that arose from those conversations was how locally penned works helped deepen an understanding of canada and """"what it means to be canadian""""
""""it is a time where people are trying to understand what it is we share that makes it such a great place to live,"""" she says
""""this year we made a huge effort to bring people in from around the country representing our diversity of origin, languages, and culture""""
between strolling the vast open-air marketplace, where vendors sell everything from indie zines, a myriad of genres, popular bestsellers and small press releases, attendees can take a break from filling up their book bags and enjoy author talks, children's activities, panel discussions, writing workshops, and french and cree language lessons
with exceptional fanfare surrounding canada's th this past july, expanding programming to include the indigenous voices and tfo franco stages are timely additions
""""these stages reflect our desire to build inclusivity and diversity into the festival's programming,"""" kanabe says """"we cannot live on indigenous land or in a bilingual country and not create a platform for these communities' important stories this is a time we have become keenly aware of our need for reconciliation in canada and we hope the dialogue inspired through the indigenous voices stage guides us on a pathway to bridge relationships between the indigenous and non-indigenous nations on turtle island""""
the tfo franco stage highlights franco-ontarian authors and francophone writing across the nation authors will appear on both stages to share stories, languages, and cultures
no matter the root of the words, within canada or beyond, the festival is a rare and special space for book lovers for all of the fest's ever-growing versatility, there is one unwavering goal at its centre: the hope of passing the magic and power of reading onto others, big and small
""""the love of reading is something that needs to reach the whole family,"""" says kanabe """"it needs to start in the schools, which is why we encourage teachers and parents alike to become engaged with the festival""""

""""Obviously, Canada is recruiting immigrants on the point system and yet these qualified people come in and have all these problems,"""" Smith said. As an example, the public service, the largest employer in Ottawa, isn't hiring new immigrants until they become Canadian citizens.","highly educated new immigrants are not doing as well as in the past because they face discrimination and problems getting their education and skills recognized, according to a new report

even with the economic recovery in the late 's, poverty among recent immigrants in  stood at  per cent overall that double the  per cent rate among the rest of the canadian population also, their pay was a third less
""""unfortunately, the situation of recent immigrants compared to other canadians has worsened considerably,"""" the report concludes
the slowdown in the economy that began in , followed by the terrorist attacks of sept  last year, have both hit new immigrants hard, says the report author, ekuwa smith
""""it has gotten really, really worse for recent immigrants because they are the first hit and they were doing very poorly anyway,"""" she said
almost all the new jobs created in the period from - were part-time or self-employment, the report says there was little new hiring in larger private and public sector workplaces that offer more security and chances for promotion
three out of four of these recent immigrants are visible minorities and """"we must recognize the impact of racial discrimination on employment, income and poverty,"""" smith said
but cities, which receive most of these immigrants, the provinces and the federal government aren't doing enough about the problem, she said """"mostly it is left to the labour market and the little that immigrant organizations can do on their own""""
what needed, smith said, are policies on employment equity, recognizing and promoting the hidden skills of new immigrants to prospective employers, better language and skill training programs and methods to speed the recognition of foreign credentials, the report says
the report echoes other studies, including one for the city of toronto, which found new immigrants and visible minority groups have unemployment and poverty rates that are two or three times higher than average
immigration is expected to account for virtually all the net growth in the canadian labour force by , the report says the proportion of university graduates among those immigrants is higher than for the rest of the canadian population-  per cent versus  for canadian men and  per cent versus  for women
""""obviously, canada is recruiting immigrants on the point system and yet these qualified people come in and have all these problems,"""" smith said as an example, the public service, the largest employer in ottawa, isn't hiring new immigrants until they become canadian citizens

you refer to a harvard study for the world health organization in which it was found that more than  countries, excluding canada, have laws geared toward prevention of the spread of this dread disease one would think these countries, including the soviet union, cuba, japan, china, saudi arabia and the us would be applauded for passing laws which involve the screening of high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users, homosexuals and prostitutes and which call for the testing of returning nationals, immigrants and high-risk travellers instead, the star condemns such precautionary measures as repressive and discriminatory
the us, it says, is the biggest offender of all for actually prosecuting aids carriers who blatantly refuse to keep the disease to themselves the airline employee who boasted of taking hundreds of his conquests with him to the grave would appear to be something of a hero to those who ascribe to the warped thinking behind this editorial
certainly, there must be compassion and understanding for all sick people in a humane society, but while we must always comfort the afflicted, there is a case for afflicting the comfortable when the collective well-being of humanity is at stake
more than half of the  countries which responded to the harvard survey seem to have weighed both sides and found that a little discrimination is preferable to a lot of needless deaths
canada, being ever the nice guy, fearfully might never come to grips with the magnitude of the aids threat, so hung up are we on the superficial importance of our human rights

1002349868,Sex-selection rush to judgment,"If these sex-selective abortions are common among Canadian immigrants born in India and South Korea and sex-selection is bad, does that mean that white women are by definition good? Because they have their preferences, too, maybe for a balanced family.","the need to control women and their bodies is a never-ending quest
many gta hospitals, particularly those in """"ethnic"""" areas, the star reported tuesday, won't let their ultrasound staff tell pregnant women the sex of the fetus one admitted it worries that women and their spouses (if any) might have the female fetus aborted in order to try again for a male
a recent study done by st michael's hospital researchers has shown that though the male/female ratio for the first child of immigrants born in india is normal canadian stuff -  boys to  girls - the ratio for third children born to such women was  boys to  girls this may mean something this may mean something wildly other than what it seems
it's complicated
the study, inspired by a canadian medical association journal editorial calling sex-selection """"repugnant,"""" has many limitations, its three authors admit ethnicity, personal family history and multi-fetal pregnancies, all these areas remain blurry these are overall figures, with hypotheses
as if it matters in the end ultrasounds are here to stay refusing to say """"girl"""" or """"boy"""" is akin to those languid doctor committees of yore that decided whether a desperate woman would be allowed her abortion or not canadian women have control over their own bodies is this to be denied to canadians of south asian and south korean origin?
it's not our business
the star recently quoted toronto """"bioethicist"""" tom koch on pregnant women who choose to abort a fetus with down syndrome """"we're engaged in eugenics, sure,"""" he said, going on to blithely deplore heartbroken couples who realize they can't cope with a disabled child or a second disabled child
""""eugenics"""" has a horrific ring to it, just as the medical term """"feticide"""" sounds worse than """"abortion"""" and is used by this study's authors
but canadian law says abortion is a personal decision i'm mystified by those who say it's ironic that feminists wanted choice and now that choice is reducing the number of females born women aren't toyota, looking to increase market share we're individuals
go blame ultrasounds, not women, the same ultrasounds that primitive southern us states force women to undergo to shame them pre-abortion ultrasounds, so handy in texas, so fraught in brampton the sexism in this medical story simply reeks
so there are """"good"""" abortions and """"bad"""" abortions, good parents and """"bad"""" aborters if these sex-selective abortions are common among canadian immigrants born in india and south korea and sex-selection is bad, does that mean that white women are by definition good? because they have their preferences, too, maybe for a balanced family
some women just want a healthy baby some women only want girls who knows, maybe they dread having to play endless games of catch in the backyard my italian girlfriend was elated when she gave birth to two boys thank god they weren't girls, she whispered to me my daughters' lives would have been so hard
i don't leap to judgment of any woman seeking an abortion no one should by deploring sex-selection - if that's what this is and we don't yet know that - we're saying """"this is a bad reason to have an abortion"""" but if we refuse the same ultrasound information in """"non-ethnic"""" areas of toronto to forestall """"bad abortions"""" in others, this is racism piled on racism
social norms do change with time the economist reports that between  and , the share of south korean women who said they felt """"they must have a son"""" fell by almost two-thirds, from  per cent to  per cent industrialization and prosperity change female prospects there is hope
here's an idea why don't we show immigrants from south asia how fair-minded canada is toward women? as well you know,  per cent of the house of commons is female, there is no wage gap and when women go for their ultrasound, the results aren't snatched away from them with a """"that's for me to know and you to find out, young lady""""
when immigrants see how women are treated, they'll realize that girls and boys have an equal chance in canadian life problem solved you're welcome

while the pallbearers, royal canadian mounted police in their red tunics, waited to lift the coffin aloft and trudeau's sons, justin and sacha, stood at attention, the symbolic rose twisted and twirled above the scene as if it didn't want to go away
it finally took off to the west toward the notre dame basilica where the funeral service for the former prime minister will be celebrated today
the crowd, which had applauded along the way as the hearse and accompanying limousines made their way from montreal's central station, broke into a rendition of """"o canada"""" led by donald potter, an english quebec unity campaigner
the national anthem rang out as the pallbearers mounted the steps and trudeau's body was carried through the heavy oak doors of the hotel de ville, directly below the balcony where the late french president charles de gaulle challenged canadian unity with his vive le quebec libre speech in july, 
it was : am on the fourth day of the extraordinary homage to the man who was canada's prime minister for nearly  years
as in ottawa over the weekend, trudeau's casket lay in state, draped in the canadian flag, with a simple wooden cross behind it and a plain red carpet in front
a brief few minutes of intimacy were given to his sons and closest friends, including retired senator jacques hebert, former chief of staff and later finance minister marc lalonde, actor jean louis roux and boyhood friend roger rolland, as well as law associates such as former parti quebecois pierre marc johnson, and former cabinet colleagues
then, the doors were opened to the general public
during his political career, trudeau profoundly divided quebecers, so it was as a montrealer that many of his friends saluted him yesterday """"he is back home where he was born, where he was raised, where he studied, where he spent most of his life,"""" said lalonde, a friend, former adviser and senior minister in trudeau's cabinet
""""it's the return to the city where he chose to live,"""" said hebert, his old friend
international trade minister pierre pettigrew described trudeau as """"a great montrealer"""" and added """"his ideal was so necessary for a city like montreal it was a demanding ideal, but over the last few days, people have been saying 'we can do it' """"
hundreds of montrealers gathered in a steady stream all day: overwhelmingly federalist, with large numbers of anglophones and immigrants expressing their gratitude to the man who symbolized their aspirations
some of those waiting in line were prominent; most were ordinary montrealers
michel robert, a judge in the quebec court of appeal, stood in line for almost an hour to pay his respects """"i am not surprised that so many people have come out he marked canada,"""" he said """"i am here because i worked very closely with him during the patriation of the constitution""""
robert was the lawyer for the federal government in  when three provinces challenged the right of the federal government to patriate the constitution unilaterally
as they shuffled forward, waiting  / to two hours to enter city hall and reach the coffin, the mourners cited a multitude of reasons for paying their last respects to trudeau but paramount, at least in the early afternoon crowd, were immigrants expressing gratitude to a man they see as a benefactor and protector
""""when i came to canada, he is the one who opened the door,"""" said maria goretti, hugging a bouquet of red roses as she waited in line
goretti, who came here from portugal in , added: """"he was a very important person in my life he was like a father for me i have a great deal of affection for him
""""he opened the door for immigrants like me i am here to express my thanks and my gratitude""""
several rows back, geoffrey churchill, an entrepreneur who immigrated here from barbados in , used almost identical words
""""i feel it is duty to be here,"""" churchill said """"mr trudeau opened canada up to people from other countries basically, he was a humanitarian""""
churchill also praised trudeau for one of the dramatic events of his career that most divides french speaking quebecers, his handling of the october  crisis when members of the front de liberation du quebec (flq) kidnapped british trade commissioner james richard cross and quebec labour minister pierre laporte
""""he was the best person to handle the situation he did handle it very well, the whole quebec issue, the separation, mr (the late pq premier rene) levesque he was absolutely brilliant, more brilliant i believe than any of the kennedys (in the united states) i don't think there are any equals to pierre trudeau""""
if there were quebecers in the crowd who were part of the  per cent of the population who voted in favour of sovereignty in the  referendum, few of them were voicing their opinions yesterday
premier lucien bouchard, whose government was slow in ordering the quebec flag flown at half mast and who lost his temper with a reporter who raised the issue at a news conference on friday, came to pay his respects yesterday but refused all comment
one man, grasping a small cardboard canadian flag in his hand as he lined up at city hall, expressed anger at the delay in lowering the fleur de lis at the quebec national assembly and elsewhere throughout the province
""""i have never voted liberal in my life but i didn't like mr bouchard's attitude,"""" said andre fortier, a retired insurance agent """"we didn't always like everything mr trudeau did but he was a french canadian""""
in the mid afternoon, media were abruptly escorted out of the foyer when trudeau's sister, suzette, came to pay her respects
earlier, one man walked up to the flag draped casket, did a pirouette, saluted, and left the room
while visitors to parliament hill tended to pause a moment before the casket, then move on, the vast majority of those who came to the city hall to see trudeau placed their hands upon the coffin for a few moments
there was solemn classical music playing in the background and visitors filed past trudeau's official portrait draped in black sash on their way to the coffin
colette beauregard, a retired sales clerk from eaton's who cherishes the memory of meeting trudeau during the  campaign, paused in front of the official portrait of the former prime minister
""""when i stood there, i saw the pride, the eyes, the face, the lips, it was as if he was looking at me""""
and beauregard insisted that not all francophones resented trudeau's policies """"we always loved pierre, we could identify with that man don't forget,  per cent of people voted against separation in """"
she was echoed by gary bertrand, a customer service representative, who insisted that dislike for trudeau in quebec is partly a myth
""""like any prime minister he made mistakes, but he was admired by most of the population, there was only a core group who resented him,"""" bertrand insisted
one woman emerged from the city hall and was so overcome with emotion that she sat down by the fountain, her head bowed, for nearly  minutes
""""i found liberty here in canada, i escaped romania in  and that's why i came here to say goodbye, to say thank you,"""" said the woman, who didn't want to give her name
danuta szyszkowska, , said trudeau made her proud of her new country, when she came to canada from poland, in  """"canada gave me my freedom, i'm proud to have called him my prime minister,"""" she said
sitting alone in the basilica yesterday afternoon, a woman in a black suit with a limp red rose on her lapel choked back tears
""""i was here saying a prayer for trudeau's boys because i know what it's like to lose a dad,"""" toronto lawyer margo langford said later on the front steps of the church
langford flew to montreal just for the day to pay her respects to the former prime minister she'd met a few times while working on parliament hill in the early s trudeau's charter of rights and freedoms inspired her to go to law school as a mature student
""""i've been watching the coverage for a couple of days i got up this morning at  am and said, 'i've got to go to montreal' """"
she said listening to other ordinary people talk about trudeau during the two hours she'd waited in line to stand in front of the casket at city hall had made the trip worthwhile
""""people still have in their hearts what he saw for us,"""" said langford """"his gift was he focused on the commonalities of the human experience rather than the differences
""""when i see something like today, i see those dreams are in everyone""""
rcmp pallbearers were rehearsing their role in the funeral yesterday tourists looked on as rcmp pallbearers shuffled through the front entrance of the historic basilica, their arms bent in front of them to carry an imaginary casket
many of the francophones in line were ardent believers in national unity
""""what mr trudeau was thinking, it's exactly my idea a united country, regardless what colour, languages we're all one country,"""" said roger boucher
the  year old retired augustinian monk waited in line clutching a single red rose """"red represents canada,"""" he said """"as you see in our flag, we have red both east and west, it's the blood that we share""""
while francophones interviewed in the crowd were measured in their comments on trudeau, mourners of immigrant origin praised him without reserve
barbados born waple haynes, who has been in canada for  years, said she owes trudeau """"everything i became in this country

a simple rule of thumb would be to add roughly  per cent to those prices to translate them into canadian dollars

according to the research group john c burns, senior managing director and timothy p sullivan, the top five housing markets ranked by size are atlanta, new york, phoenix, dallas-fort worth and washington, dc
the fastest growing markets - and the most likely to see rising prices - are naples, fla, myrtle beach, sc, fort myers, fla, las vegas and raleigh-durham, nc

while the election consumed  days in summer and fall, for the rest of the year (and yes, there was some overlap) the name mike duffy was the talk of canadian politics duffy's trial kicked offover the summer, and he faces  charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery the trial consumed political coverage and talk for weeks on end, especially during the high-profile testimony of harper confidants the resolution to that trial will come sometime in the new year
also in the new year, it will become clearer what the paris climate accord means for canada and the world it marks a major accomplishment for the international system that nearly  countries are on board we are, however, skeptical about a successful implementation - is it really possible that without legally binding requirements the world will voluntarily reduce carbon emissions? it's a big if, in our view, and we'll be watching closely to see if canada - itself truant on the kyoto accord - manages to stay on track keeping the government on track will require citizens holding politicians to account
it's impossible, in the canadian context, to think of climate change without being diverted by economic concerns it was not a stellar year for the canadian economy, as the price of oil plunged and the country briefly entered a technical recession in the wake of the paris agreement, and in the midst of a downturn and an economic setback on the keystone xl pipeline, now is as good a time as any to begin answering questions about our economic future and the place of the oilsands in that future much of the innovation, probably pushed by some sort of carbon pricing, will fall to the business and entrepreneurial sectors in this country
so, too, must the economy look to absorb thousands of newcomers, including refugees from the syrian conflict in , we were much, much too slow on taking refugees it took alan kurdi's death, and the photo of his tiny body washed up on the beach, to spur us to action that's to our shame and, in the past, over the years and decades, we've not always been as generous as we like to think canadians must remember that response to refugees is not a one-time issue concerning syria it's our moral duty to ask how we will reform the system in coming years to bring in more refugees in a way that expedites their arrival while making sure we have done our due diligence on security
on the campaign trail, and since the election, the liberals have made several other bold promises in a major change from the years of conservative rule, the liberals have taken an activist approach to the first nations file refugees may be coming, but the vast majority of us are migrants to this country our political life would be richer and deeper were we to remember it in june, the truth and reconciliation commission released  recommendations for rectifying some of the injustices perpetrated against indigenous people
trudeau has promised - perhaps unwisely - to implement all of them this is a file that, unless handled judiciously, could easily get very expensive and consume enormous amounts of political capital on all sides
when it comes to queen's park, premier kathleen wynne will face a stiffening opposition from patrick brown, who assumed the leadership of the progressive conservatives conservatism has been badly diminished across canada (the exception being brad wall in saskatchewan), and brown, who beat christine elliott in may by tacking rightward, is going to have a challenging path forward in ontario but he has time and room to manoeuvre, and with the recent charges laid in relation to the mcguinty-era gas-plant cancellations and an auditor general's report slamming government ineptitude, he may do well to simply allow this government to defeat itself
meanwhile, in ottawa, seemingly nothing set the city on fire like the sens' race to the playoffs last season andrew (hamburglar) hammond's goaltending electrified us and then there's the redblacks, who delighted the city by making it to the grey cup in only their second season they fell just short of glory, but after so many missteps, to see the franchise perform so well and so quickly is a fine omen, indeed elsewhere in local sports, smiths falls golfer brooke henderson had an incredible year, becoming the first canadian to win on the lpga tour in more than a decade
for some, though, the big story of the year locally has to be in the uber-versus-taxi feud - which is flummoxing legislators across the country ottawa had the added conflict of a taxi-versustaxi feud between drivers and management the industry is struggling, hit hard by technological change and consumer preference and the regulatory setup in city halls across the province and country local governments must look to reform taxi-plate quotas in a way that's fair to drivers but does not try to hold back the inevitable
locally, we watch with anticipation the continued development of the lrt, even as we cast a guarded look at the financial situation at city hall finally, we saw the right decision made on the memorial to the victims of communism, which will not go on the front lawn of the supreme court
ottawa also watched with horror as police responded to the tragic murders of three women in the area around wilno canada, ontario and ottawa must do better in  on women's rights, domestic violence and sexual assault
elsewhere locally, there was good news ottawa senators owner eugene melnyk found a donor for a liver transplant, helping raise awareness of the shortage of organs donations it is, perhaps, time for an opt-out policy regarding organ donations on the arts front, the national arts centre orchestra scored conductor alexander shelley, who has brought new energy to the institution at a critical time, as it fights to attract a new audience
in the midst of so much tragedy caused by terrorism, it was at le bataclan theatre and other nightlife spots in paris in november that canadians were reminded most poignantly of the threat of international terror this followed the january attack on the office of charlie hebdo, the satirical newspaper in response to charlie hebdo, western leaders were steadfast: freedom of expression would not be cowed by terror we said, at the time, """"courage, france""""
there's no doubt that the coming year's biggest challenge, for the international community, is confronting the islamic state it is a problem with no obvious or easy answer the way forward is unclear, with no western country appearing to have a cogent plan about what to do bombing isil seems to have stopped its advance in some places and has supported iraqi forces in taking back some territory but what about bashar assad, the syrian dictator? what of russia's increased involvement in the region? the bombing cannot continue indefinitely the split between isil, assad and other fighters in syria are creating a quagmire that defies a simple - or, frankly, even a complex - solution
the liberal government must think long and hard about the role we should play though the liberals have promised to withdraw canadian fighter jets, weeks after the election cf- fighters continue to bomb isil positions the government needs to approach the issue with an open mind regarding what canada's role should be, while remaining wary of mission creep or being drawn into an intractable conflict
with all this in mind, we should not overstate our problems canada is peaceful and prosperous, and we are one of the most blessed nations on earth and so we look to  in full hope that our good fortune will continue and in full expectation that, whatever challenges arise, canadians and their governments will meet them with the full force of our collective industry, talents and good sense
happy new year to all our readers

2638318794,Skilled immigrants face hurdles coming to Canada; Labour shortage for high-skilled category,Aucun(e) disponible.,"despite a reduced number of highskilled immigrants being accepted into canada over the next two years, immigration minister sean fraser insists canada will have the people it needs to fill the jobs it has
last month, fraser introduced in parliament his first levels plan as immigration minister it proposes having , people become permanent residents next year, rising to , by 
but in the next two years, the number of immigrants in the federal high-skilled category will be almost half of what the government had previously planned the government is targeting to bring in , people in that class, while in october  it forecast it would be bringing in , people
fraser said the government was still targeting to accept more economic immigrants than ever before, it was just adopting a different strategy due to the pandemic
the reduction in skilled workers comes at the expense of a new program developed during the pandemic called the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway, which took people already in canada - on work or student visas - and gave them permanent residency
fraser said that was a smart program for the pandemic and it made sense to continue, but then wind it down
""""we want to make sure that people who are here making a contribution now have an easier time staying here so they can keep making that contribution while we continue to use the different economic streams to meet the overall needs of the economy,"""" he said
the government plans to process , people through that category this year and , next year, before phasing the program out in 
the change will mean further delays for people outside canada who wish to immigrate here fraser said it could be later this spring before canada was even inviting applicants to apply again
""""there's been real frustration for people who were in the federal skilled worker stream seeking to come to canada through those existing streams,"""" he said """"we will be resuming federal skilled worker draws in the near term""""
despite the delays, fraser said he didn't think canada had to worry about slipping as a destination of choice
""""for quite a number of years, we have been winning the race for global talent the only question is, to what degree can we win it by a wider margin,"""" he said """"canada is a destination of choice and i expect will remain a destination of choice for people looking to migrate around the world""""
fraser's plan was tabled before russia's invasion of ukraine the government hasn't specified how many refugees it will take from ukraine, but it is prioritizing applications from the country and opening up the ability for ukrainians to travel here on long-term visas that would allow them to work and study
prime minister justin trudeau announced an additional $ million in funding to process applications from ukraine
leah nord, director of workplace strategies with the canadian chamber of commerce, said they fully support the government's efforts to increase immigration levels
""""our members are highly supportive of immigration, they diversify communities, they diversify workforces, and they fill labour shortages,"""" she said
she said they do wonder about the plans to reduce economic class immigrants in favour of people already in canada """"we need everybody and it should be both and not either/or""""
she said every industry in the country was facing some level of labour shortage and the government should continue to open the doors wide to the world
""""we need all workers we have a labour shortage here people say it's 'unprecedented,'i use unfathomable,"""" she said """"it's across sectors, it's across communities, and it's across skills""""
betsy kane, an ottawa immigration lawyer and member of the canadian immigration lawyers association, said it was really difficult for people to come to canada
""""the system is uniquely challenged right now and it's very difficult even for the best applicants to get through the system,"""" he said """"the government is trying but for applicants, it's very, very frustrating""""
kane said canada still had an advantage as a destination, with peace and security, a good economy and strong public services, but the delay was a barrier to many immigrants
""""we're not a rapid pathway we are a good pathway the systems in place, the programs in place are very good, but you have to be patient and you have to go through a lot of prerequisite hoops to position yourself for success""""
kane said as new demands crop up, like the current demand from people fleeing ukraine, she hoped the government kept adding resources to ensure the system returned to more normal wait times
""""we just hope that the system stabilizes and the money that's going to be injected into the system over the next two years, allows the government to move forward with a more robust immigration levels""""

241000555,Global warming's huddled masses::   [Final Edition ],"Such predictions also dwarf the numbers of people displaced by climate in the past. People displaced in North America during the Dust Bowl years, in South Asia by past typhoons, and in Latin America by Hurricane Mitch numbered in the hundreds of thousands in each case. Only the 1998 Yangtze River floods, which temporarily displaced an estimated 14 million people, begin to approach the scale of the predictions made in the U.K. climate report. The extent to which climate change will lead to population displacements and environmental refugee movements depends on a number of factors. It depends on how the impacts of climate change unfold. If rising sea levels, and changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns, occur in a gradual, linear fashion, estimates of 200 million people displaced may be much too high. This is because many communities, organizations and economic systems will have the opportunity to adapt to new climactic conditions. If Canada is to receive climate-change refugees, they will most likely come from vulnerable, developing countries that are already sources of migration to Canada. The four largest sources of current migration to Canada -- China, India, the Philippines and Pakistan -- all feature regularly in analyses of regions where large populations may be vulnerable to climate-change impacts.","  canada has an obligation to help developing countries deal with a future in which hundreds of millions are on the move, many of whom will arrive on our doorstep
last month the british government released a detailed and pessimistic report about the future impacts of climate change one of the more worrying statements was that rising sea levels, floods and drought could displace more than  million people worldwide within the next  years
this is not the first time such alarming predictions have been made last year the un university's institute for environment and human security warned that we should expect  million environmental refugees within the next five years similar forecasts have appeared in recent years in publications of environmental groups and on the editorial pages of many of the world's leading newspapers
how reliable are these predictions? should canada brace to receive waves of environmental refugees as a result?
to put the numbers into context, at present there are between nine and  million people officially recognized as refugees by the united nations, with another  million being identified as persons of concern (such as stateless people and people displaced within the boundaries of their own countries) the predictions made in the british climate-change report would represent a -fold expansion of the current global population of refugees and internally displaced people
such predictions also dwarf the numbers of people displaced by climate in the past people displaced in north america during the dust bowl years, in south asia by past typhoons, and in latin america by hurricane mitch numbered in the hundreds of thousands in each case only the  yangtze river floods, which temporarily displaced an estimated  million people, begin to approach the scale of the predictions made in the uk climate report
the extent to which climate change will lead to population displacements and environmental refugee movements depends on a number of factors it depends on how the impacts of climate change unfold if rising sea levels, and changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns, occur in a gradual, linear fashion, estimates of  million people displaced may be much too high this is because many communities, organizations and economic systems will have the opportunity to adapt to new climactic conditions
if, however, we see increases in the number and frequency of extreme events, or if climate change proceeds in a non-linear fashion (that is, there are sudden shifts in climactic norms), estimates of  million displaced are probably much too low
we have seen how slow and difficult the recovery process has been in louisiana after hurricane katrina, a single extreme event no country, not even the united states, would be ready for an increase in the frequency of such storms
how soon can we expect to see people displaced by climate change? people living on certain small islands in the south pacific and off the coast of alaska have already been forced to relocate due to infrastructure damage caused by unusually high sea levels during storms these people might be the first of many climate change refugees should the trends we are observing continue
the people most vulnerable to climate change tend to live in developing countries, where they often lack the financial resources and technology to adapt to harsh climactic conditions in the way canadians can in many developing countries, migration is already used as a means of adapting to seasonal variations as well as extreme events
for example, a semi-arid region of west africa known as the sahel has been particularly drought-prone over the past several decades one of the ways households have adapted is by having their young men and women migrate after harvest each year
where the young people migrate depends on the success of the harvest after a good harvest, the family may use its financial reserves to send a member off to europe in search of work this is a highly speculative undertaking, for the costs are high and the rewards are uncertain also, the chances are the migrant will not be home in time for the next planting season to reduce the risks, the migrant will follow in the path of friends or relatives who have migrated before, relying on them for assistance in getting established in the destination country
in a drought year, when harvests are poor, the migrants stay much closer to home they travel to nearby cities to seek work and to reduce the demand on the household's food reserves in such years, the risks associated with long-distance migration are too much to bear
similar migration patterns have been observed in other parts of the world we saw them in western north america during the s
the implications are this: harsh climactic conditions trigger local or regional-scale migrations they are less likely to trigger overseas migrations, and those who do migrate will follow established migrant networks therefore, the impacts of climate change may displace many people, and most are likely to remain in their home regions
if canada is to receive climate-change refugees, they will most likely come from vulnerable, developing countries that are already sources of migration to canada the four largest sources of current migration to canada -- china, india, the philippines and pakistan -- all feature regularly in analyses of regions where large populations may be vulnerable to climate-change impacts
in short, climate change may well increase the number of people seeking to come to canada from existing source countries perhaps not millions, but the increased pressure will be noticeable climate change will also increase rural-to-urban migration in many parts of the developing world, placing downward pressure on the economic sustainability of those areas and increasing poverty and political instability
there are any number of policy options available to canada clearly, building adaptive capacity at home and abroad must be a priority
even were the kyoto protocol to be successfully implemented worldwide, we would still be locked into a considerably different set of future climactic conditions from what we are used to, with an increased risk of population displacements canada's financial contributions to international development generally, and to helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate change specifically, have been embarrassingly low in recent years
we can continue ignoring these risks, or we can start constructing greater capacity for change in vulnerable regions and maybe -- just maybe -- prevent millions from being displaced
robert mcleman is an assistant professor in geography at the university of ottawa he has written several studies on the links between climate change and migration for scientific journals and international security organizations

'tremendous gains' in life expectancy to slow
canadians can expect to live longer in the future, but shouldn't bank on triple-digit lifespans, according to a report released this past week by the federal office of the superintendent of financial institutions

""""further increases in life expectancy are projected in the future, but at a slower pace than has been observed in the past,"""" the report said, adding that most future advances will have to come through extending the lives of the elderly """"this will present a challenge, as there is still much to be learned about the diseases that affect the old and the aging process itself""""
in addition, our lifestyles could prevent us from living even longer
""""the rising incidence of obesity in both children and adults and consequent deterioration in health, as well as the emergence of more virulent forms of infectious diseases worldwide, could act to reduce future projected gains in life expectancy,"""" it said

Montreal schools are filled with Chinese, Haitian, Jewish and Arab teenagers who speak perfect French, often with the Quebecois accent of an east-end garage mechanic.","for a jewish kid, i knew all the carolsi was walking down a busy montreal street last week when i suddenly realized i was belting out the words to """"hark, the herald angels sing""""
it's an odd song for a nice jewish boy to sing but i have an oddly personal relationship with christmas like most quebec jews, i was educated by an english protestant school system, so christianity is part of my tradition
i spent every morning of childhood learning endless christian hymns that most jews in montreal know by heart, from """"jesus loves me"""" to """"o little town of bethlehem"""" i can still go to any montreal synagogue and lead the congregation in a rousing chorus of """"onward, christian soldiers"""" - and they'll all know the words, including the rabbi
behind my jewish protestant tribe is a story that affects everything from the makeup of montreal's anglophone community to the possible results of this christmas election campaign
until several years ago, quebec's public schools were run by religious-based systems - either protestant or catholic for decades, the french catholic system didn't accept non-believers like me, so the english protestants shrewdly took us in, happy to convert us
by age , i was playing the good shepherd in my school christmas play, while my pal abie got a more authentic jewish role - as jesus in high school, practically my entire class choir was jewish, but we sang our christmas carols with the gusto of the mormon tabernacle choir
my own favourite was """"o come, all ye faithful,"""" which i practised at our breakfast table, stunning my parents with the stirring finale
""""o come, let us ado-o-ore hi-i-m, chri-i-ist the lord!""""
it wasn't just jews who sang for jesus most quebec minorities were funnelled into protestant-run schools portuguese, chinese, even many greek orthodox kids, as well as a smattering of sikhs and buddhists who knew their christian hymns as well as me
due to my childhood brainwashing, christmas still holds a sappy place in my heart my christian friends have a love-hate relationship with christmas but i love it, because i have no obligations except to sing, drink and eat
i don't have to go christmas shopping and spend $, on gifts i just go to christmas parties and attend christmas concerts where i sing louder than anyone else i've watched miracle on th street  times, and i think it's a wonderful life is a wonderful film
but i'm the tail end of the protestant-jewish generation in quebec, and our decline is part of a big social shift whose impact goes far beyond christmas
things began to change in the early 's when francophone birth rates started plummeting their political leaders suddenly realized that keeping us non-catholics out of their schools meant handing most minority groups to quebec's english community
allophones were becoming anglophones, united like a single nation in defence of the english apostrophe on commercial signs like eaton's
in , bill  finally changed the spirit of christmas by forcing the children of immigrants to attend french-language public schools since then, most ethnic quebecers learn in french and sing """"il est ne le divin enfant"""" at christmas, if they still sing christian tunes at all
my -year old son goes to french school (our choice) and he's losing the family christmas tradition he and most of his ethnic classmates don't know any christmas tunes in english, or even that many in french
quebec's english and french schools were de-confessionalizied in  and my son's politically correct christmas choir program has included german, hebrew and south african tunes, while christ keeps a low profile and santa claus may be next up for the axe
but the de-anglicization of quebec schooling for minorities has far greater importance than my son's acquaintance with """"silent night"""" and """"away in a manger"""" it may have political ramifications on this federal election and beyond
we protestant jews and other anglo minorities always voted religiously for liberals or other federalists, but today's quebec allophones have different loyalties montreal schools are filled with chinese, haitian, jewish and arab teenagers who speak perfect french, often with the quebecois accent of an east-end garage mechanic
unlike former minority groups, these children of bill  belong to the french-speaking community and aren't scared silly of the bloc quebecois or the pq like many young people, they're drawn to left- wing parties that promise change, but the ndp is almost as marginal in french quebec as the new moose party
consequently, the bloc is counting on these young ethnics to increase its vote this election (if they vote at all)
gilles duceppe also believes these kids will change the math in any future referendum, though i think that's more questionable i suspect that if it ever comes to another sovereignty vote, their ethnic roots will also be drawn toward canadian soil
but for the moment, all those kids who aren't singing """"onward, christian soldiers"""" in school may well help the bloc get  per cent of the overall vote in quebec for the first time this election
this christmas, many federalists are still singing """"o come, all ye faithful,"""" but fewer and fewer people know the words

""""If people don't understand what factors will maintain health and maintain healthy communities, then they're going to be unable to make the changes necessary (for improving health),"""" he said. """"Knowing is not enough, but it's an important prerequisite for change.""""","more than half of canadian adults do not have the skillsnecessary to properly make daily decisions about their health, according to a report released yesterday by the canadian public health association
its expert panel called the low levels of health literacy in canada """"critical"""" and says a countrywide strategy is needed to solve the problem, especially since our health-care system will become increasingly complex
only one in eight seniors has adequate health literacy skills, which suggests most may not be able to cope with the health-care system on their own, the panel found
this is particularly worrying since seniors are more likely to have chronic health problems and need more medications than the average adult canadian, the panel said
recent immigrants, people with low incomes and low levels of education, and people for whom english or french is not a first language are also most likely to struggle with health literacy, said irving rootman, executive director of the health and learning centre at the university of victoria, and co-chair of the expert panel
health literacy is defined as the ability to access, understand and use health information, and studies have shown low health literacy is linked to poor health research has shown the prevalence of diabetes - a chronic condition that can be managed with lifestyle changes - goes down as health literacy goes up
a similar trend was observed for high blood pressure, according to a february report by the canadian council on learning
rootman said the panel's findings were drawn from a  analysis of , canadians by the canadian council on learning participants were asked to perform different tasks related to health literacy, such as figuring out a dose of medication for a small child from a prescription label
even though health information can be found on the internet, rootman said a study conducted by the university of victoria found a minimum of grade  reading skills was required to understand most internet information in canada, the us and australia
""""that's much higher than the average reading level in the population,"""" he said """"most websites aren't written for people who don't have adequate literacy skills""""
the panel recommends a national strategy to improve health literacy skills that may include a multimedia campaign to raise awareness of the issue, integrate health literacy into school curricula and set and monitor specific literacy targets
canadians can immediately start to improve health literacy by reading more every day, said rootman, pointing out research has shown daily reading is the best predictor of higher health literacy
""""people also need to know that they should always ask questions, that they shouldn't be afraid of medical people if they don't understand something""""
the current health system also has to become more sensitive to languages, culture and literacy levels to adequately meet the needs of canadians, said rootman, who is researching whether videos are a good way to communicate with communities where language is a problem
dr david henry, ceo of the institute for clinical evaluative sciences in toronto and adjunct professor of medicine at the university of newcastle in australia, said health illiteracy, which is poor in the general population and common around the world, is a cause for concern
""""if people don't understand what factors will maintain health and maintain healthy communities, then they're going to be unable to make the changes necessary (for improving health),"""" he said """"knowing is not enough, but it's an important prerequisite for change""""
henry said the media has an important role to play in improving health literacy right now, he said the quality of health coverage in the canadian, american and australian media is quite poor

while every canadian ought to recognize the historical injustices our governments committed against indigenous canadians, is cancelling canada day the right response? first, let's remember that this is , not , nor even the s, by which time most residential schools had ceased to operate since then, we've had the truth and reconciliation commission, which acknowledged that indigenous canadians suffered a """"cultural genocide"""" and recognizing that indigenous canadians generally may have fewer advantages than other canadians due to historical injustices, all levels of government and many private institutions now have comprehensive affirmative action policies to help indigenous canadians
while work remains to be done, these developments are a sign that canada is moving in the right direction a national day is an opportunity for all of us who call this country home to express our collective appreciation for the many good things canada has done for us, and as a place in which people of all backgrounds have opportunities to succeed
this idea of canada is worth celebrating
happily, most canadians agree a leger poll recently commissioned by postmedia finds only  per cent of those surveyed favour abolishing our national holiday meanwhile,  per cent want the canadian flag displayed """"more often and in more places"""" the pro-flag sentiment was higher among people of colour, which doesn't surprise me at all
it's primarily a small number of far-left activists who are calling for the cancellation of our national day, but it's for a nation they don't even believe in they believe canada as a nation-state is fundamentally evil, a """"white colonial settler society"""" that is illegitimate and immoral their extreme views must not be allowed to shape a legitimate national debate on how canada can better itself
for those of us who chose canada, and didn't have the privilege of being born in one of the wealthiest, most advanced countries in the world, the notion of cancelling canada day seems truly bizarre many of us came from countries where racism and discrimination are often widespread, sanctioned by the state ask a non-muslim living in the arab world, where discrimination is baked into the system; or a muslim in india, where, despite theoretical equality under the law, bigotry is pervasive, with the government often looking the other way we need to consider canada in the context of the real world, not compare it to a utopian ideal
unfortunately, there is a vacuum in political leadership when it comes to standing up for canada, even when the very foundations are being challenged apart from conservative leader erin o'toole, who has said he opposes any attempt at cancelling canada day, few other leaders have taken a stand both prime minister justin trudeau and ndp leader jagmeet singh have called for thursday to serve as a day of reflection, rather than celebration such lame prevarication lets down the many canadians - not least of whom are the immigrants who toiled and sacrificed to come here - who don't feel at all squeamish about expressing pride in the country they've made their home
the idea of canada has evolved from a group of former british colonies that didn't wish to be absorbed into the us, into a multicultural, multi-ethnic microcosm of the world at its best there is tragedy in some of that history, of course but canada day is worth celebrating for everything good that this country has done, because it is a nation that recognizes its mistakes, and because it is always working towards becoming better this is why canada day matters",The Kingston Whig-Standard,2021-06-30,2021,6,30

the flurry of federal government announcements last week was not a sign that the slumbering chretien liberals had suddenly found some ambition (fortunately) it was instead a classic spin doctor ploy: rapid release of bad news announcements reduces the amount of attention any one item gets and if an ice storm pushes all your announcements right off the front pages, god has a party membership card
buried amid last week icy rubble was a report calling for a complete overhaul of the immigration system that the liberals chose to release the report in the midst of a bad news dump, and that the immigration minister has scheduled an absurdly quick round of public hearings on it, are unsettling indications that the government would like it just to vanish into the public archives

although the word most used by the media to describe the report was """"controversial,"""" i strongly suspect the only thing canadians will find shocking about most of the recommendations is that they're not already in place
consider the report insistence that immigrants be able to speak english or french, or, in some cases, pay for the cost of language training ability to use one of canada official languages is, unsurprisingly, the key determinant of successful integration, yet governments have allowed language proficiency to plummet: in the early s, just five per cent of immigrants arrived unable to speak either english or french; in the early s,  per cent could speak neither in , an astounding  per cent of the much- vaunted investor class of immigrants could not speak english or french
free-market conservatives have opposed a language requirement on the grounds that useful new cogs -- homines economici -- might be excluded from the economic machine: they would prefer the computer programmer from bombay just to pump out computer code, not talk to us but immigration is about talking it a form of community building, and there can be no community if we cannot speak with our neighbours immigrants know this best: polls show that a huge majority of immigrant-canadians favour a language requirement, even greater than the large majority of native canadians who agree
this proposal, and specific recommendations, are likely to get the most ink, but the report most important suggestions are long overdue attempts to inject some accountability into what has been an unaccountable system first, the report recommends separating the immigration and refugee systems into two new sets of legislation each act would state its goals and how it intends to accomplish them, finally giving the public something to measure immigration effects by putting the goals and means in bold black-and-white might finally force a public debate about what exactly it is canadians want immigration to accomplish and how it should do that

438713697,"All quiet on the border?; New book warns of the harsh impact stepped-up American security has on the lives of Canadians Professor says after Sept. 11, 'Canada is in new kind of relationship with the U.S.,' by Olivia Ward:   [ONT Edition ]","Says York University professor Daniel Drache, the world's longest undefended border - an 8,000-kilometre frontier crossed by 200 million people a year - has changed dramatically in its significance for Canadians since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. """"The events of Sept. 11 have forced Canadians to re-examine whether it is possible to pick and choose when they will be engaged with their southern neighbour,"""" he told a National Press Club meeting. """"The border crisis forced immediate decisions about a common strategy of border management. It was clear that the U.S. would fortify its perimeter approaches. The issue for Canada was whether it wanted to be inside that perimeter or outside."""" LUCAS OLENIUK TORONTO STAR York political science professor Daniel Drache says the once-friendly border between the United States and Canada has become a security wall that affects Canadians.","some of it is ragged with brush and weeds, other stretches are stony mountain paths and its best-known patches resemble parking lots of steaming cars and fuming drivers at busy times of day
canada's border with the united states is, for citizens of both countries, a geographical fact of life, something for which few people spare a second thought unless seeking the quickest crossing point to their destination
but, says york university professor daniel drache, the world's longest undefended border - an ,-kilometre frontier crossed by  million people a year - has changed dramatically in its significance for canadians since the terrorist attacks of sept , 
""""suddenly canada is in a new kind of relationship with the us,"""" he says """"the old ideas of a 'friendly' border no longer apply new american legislation has turned the border into a security wall we are now imprisoned in north america""""
drache, associate director of the robarts centre of canadian studies, is the author of borders matter homeland security and the search for north america and, he says, it's time that canadians woke up to their new role as outsiders on a continent dominated by a suspicious, and sometimes autocratic, superpower
""""if we don't come to grips with these huge changes, america's border policies will go on undermining canadian sovereignty we didn't negotiate these changes, they've been imposed on us
""""what's at risk are some of our basic values the way we treat immigration, political refugees, freedom of movement, diversity and our own foreign policy we need a new plan for dealing with the new realities""""
if canadians are only slowly realizing the deeper significance of the border, it is nothing new in our history the great north-south divide is, in fact, a relative latecomer to north america's political geography
until the american revolution of , the colonized continent was british, and the demarcation that followed america's violent birth was slow to affect the lives of those on either side in this sparsely populated and densely forested territory, settlers often had to guess in which country they were building their homes some were surprised to learn it was the wrong one
although american attacks on canada during the war of  reinforced the desire for securer borders, cross-border traffic was often a free-for-all in , some , americans stampeded to the yukon to join the gold rush meanwhile, thousands of immigrating europeans regularly trekked through canada en route to their southern destinations
in much of the th century, the border issue was one of free trade, a political hand-wringer that saw campaigners elected or booted from office while a few voices touted the benefits of joining the muscular american economy, most canadians feared being crushed by their neighbour's steely embrace a s article in time magazine, naming canada the th state, did nothing to calm the fierce frontier debate
in the s and early 's, pierre trudeau called for more international ties and less reliance on the united states, raising cross-border tensions
but brian mulroney's resurgent free trade policy ended in the  nafta agreement, an accord that defenders of the canadian border saw as the beginning of the end
drache says / changed all that now security, not economics, has drawn a line in the sand that threatens to be deep and lasting it is far more significant than the effects of the free trade agreement
economically, canada's ties with the us are tighter than the spaces between automobiles in the detroit-windsor tunnel eighty- seven per cent of canadian trade is with america, and more than $ billion (us) a day flows north across the border all in all, americans buy two-thirds more of our goods than we consume ourselves
but even before the terrorist attacks of sept , drache says, the us was heading in a far different direction from canada in its social, political, economic and religious values after the election of president george w bush
""""the bush revolution joins onto the (ronald) reagan revolution it's a continuation of deregulation, and the transfer of enormous wealth from middle america to a small group of super-rich elites bush is symbolic of the fundamental transformation of the us there you can have individual rights, but not equality of opportunity""""
and, he adds, figures show that for all its lack of self- confidence, canada has come out a winner by resisting american pressure to dismantle its social safety net  per cent of canadians, compared with  per cent of americans, are in low-paid jobs; child poverty affects one in six canadians but one in four americans; unemployment benefits pay  per cent of canadian workers' wages, but only  per cent of american wages; and almost  per cent of canadian workers are unionized, as opposed to  per cent in america
however, says drache, """"after sept , we were on a collision course""""
as soon as the smoke had cleared from the horrifying scene of the collapsed world trade center towers, american policymakers began to act, fortifying their defences in every direction quickly, they cast baleful eyes toward canada, which one american congressman had pronounced """"a club med for terrorists""""
""""terrorists do not respect borders,"""" said homeland defence expert frank cilluffo of the washington-based center for strategic and international studies """"but law enforcement authorities must""""
what was needed, he said, was """"the creation of a perimeter around both countries that will require standardization of policies in several areas""""
the kind of co-ordination washington was urging became clear with the establishment of the massive department of homeland security, with a $ billion budget and , employees empowered with legal authority to take any actions necessary to protect us interests inside or outside of its borders
the patriot act also gave border officials and police unprecedented powers to act against suspected terrorism
""""from washington's perspective, there is no longer a shared canada-us consensus that each country is responsible for its own side of the fence,"""" drache says
he argues the us security net has fallen over canada almost undetected the enormous changes made under the homeland security mandate include tough regulations for visitors, political refugees and immigrants; new security requirements for tourists, business travelers and all vehicles entering us space; outreach of police and intelligence forces beyond national borders; unfettered intelligence gathering coupled with lack of protection for civil liberties; new security checks for foreign citizens, including fingerprinting, with information banked in government computers
the sweeping changes have already affected canadian lives, drache says in the most dramatic cases, """"citizens not born in canada are treated in a different way, as we saw with (ottawa computer specialist) maher arar, who was sent to syria, where he was born, against his will""""
perrin beatty, former foreign minister and head of canadian manufacturers and exporters, also believes canada is in danger of being swept into washington's security orbit without a parachute
""""the events of sept  have forced canadians to re-examine whether it is possible to pick and choose when they will be engaged with their southern neighbour,"""" he told a national press club meeting """"the border crisis forced immediate decisions about a common strategy of border management it was clear that the us would fortify its perimeter approaches the issue for canada was whether it wanted to be inside that perimeter or outside""""
to americans, however, the aggressive anti-terror policies were a matter of common sense
the  case of algerian-born ahmed ressam, who planned an unsuccessful attack on the us after canada failed to execute a deportation order against him, led many americans to question canadian refugee policies even before sept 
""""from the american standpoint, these and other features of the canadian political landscape could be perceived as 'soft spots' that could compromise canadian security, with refugee law and policy considered too generous, and funding levels for law enforcement not generous enough,"""" said cilluffo, in his paper entitled terrorism and the canada-us border
in his recent book, canadian author stewart bell also makes a case for tougher measures and more co-ordination with the us in security matters
""""canadians like to think of themselves as benevolent world citizens, peacekeepers in blue berets who bring kindness and calm to troubled lands,"""" writes bell in cold terror how canada nurtures and exports terrorism around the world
""""the cold truth is that, since the early s, canada has become a source country of international terrorism""""
bell writes that """"canada is in many ways a case study in what can happen when politicians let down their guard against security threats and wilfully ignore warnings for partisan reasons""""
anxious not to be seen as a terror haven, canada rapidly took steps after sept  to upgrade security within three months ottawa signed the smart border declaration that launched an """"action plan"""" to identify """"security risks"""" before they arrive in north america, and develop common standards for screening dangerous cargo heading for the continent it would also beef up border security and increase intelligence sharing
many canadians agree that security is a vitally important issue at a time when terrorists could unpredictably strike but, says drache, """"the idea is to have a policy, not to bounce off the american agenda we have to assess what the threats are to our security for instance, we questioned that the war in iraq would improve it""""
but, he says, """"we can't assess the us's homeland security policy unless we have an inventory of the way in which it has impacted on canada it's a large project, and so far there's no sign that it has been started""""
canada's often-lampooned insecurity shouldn't get in the way of negotiating for its own interests, even in an age of """"bare-knuckle"""" diplomacy, drache says """"if there's a single message in (my) book, it's that being a prudent, middle-power country with a perennial lack of confidence should not be confused with being voiceless or powerless
""""we can be friends, at a distance""""

we were on a collision course'

239755997,"`Keep out', Ottawa chief tells hate groups:   [Final Edition ]","Still, Ottawa police are now preparing to lay their first charges under the hate law. The case, unrelated to Saturday night's clash, stems from the distribution of hate literature sometime in the past few months. The Ottawa-Carleton Boys and Girls Club, where Saturday's dance was held, is looking at how to prevent groups such as Heritage Front from renting club space. Club officials say they didn't know who was sponsoring the dance. Local hotels also will be tightening security, said Peter Howard, president of Ottawa Hoteliers Inc., representing Ottawa's major hotels. And Ottawa Mayor Jacquelin Holzman has asked city administrators to review procedures for renting city property to private groups.","  white supremacist groups such as heritage front should be prevented from even holding a meeting, says ottawa police chief brian ford
""""they promote hatred against jews, gays and visible minorities, ford said monday """"there's no place for this in our society
his comments follow saturday's near-riot between the white-supremacist group heritage front and anti-racist protesters
about  members of heritage front, led by former ku klux klansman wolfgang droege, held a recruitment-drive and concert at a rented nepean street hall
running street fights erupted between the two after the meeting and dance ford admitted monday his officers weren't prepared to prevent the late-night clash and a review of the department's handling of the incident has been ordered
""""i'm very concerned this (a violent confrontation) is going to happen again
ford also wants the criminal code revised to sharpen the language and broaden the definition of hate crimes
that sentiment is echoed by some visible minority groups, who see toughening hate laws as one way to combat extremist groups such as heritage front
but how far can the state go towards making racism or hatred illegal?
and what balance should be struck between promoting a tolerant society and protecting the right to free speech and assembly?
canada's hate propaganda law makes it a crime to advocate genocide against an identifiable group it's also illegal to make public statements inciting hatred against an identifiable group, """"where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace
please see hate/a
but it's unclear how that should be interpreted the law has only been used a handful of times the most famous conviction was against james keegstra, the alberta high school teacher who taught his students that the holocaust was a hoax
ottawa police have a two-officer bias-crimes unit that monitors the activities of extremist groups but with racist activity on the rise, it's clear that two officers are not enough, said ford
as well, police say the language in the hate law is vague, and there is little case law to guide officers in laying a charge
""""there's not much the police can do, said ford """"it's very difficult to enforce the average police officer would have trouble interpreting the code
for instance, the law says a charge can only be laid if the promotion of hatred is made in public
""""is a rented hall a public place? asks ford """"under the code, no one knows
and, unlike most criminal offences, the attorney general must approve before charges can be laid
still, ottawa police are now preparing to lay their first charges under the hate law the case, unrelated to saturday night's clash, stems from the distribution of hate literature sometime in the past few months
but others say the problem is not with the law, but with police and attorneys general who don't enforce it
""""we have the law, we lack the will, said bernie farber, spokesman for the canadian jewish congress """"the law is strong enough use it
the current hate propaganda law was upheld by the supreme court of canada in the keegstra case
but alan borovoy, of the canadian civil liberties association, said the law already goes too far in, """"threatening the free speech of a wide variety of people who don't bear any resemblance to hatemongers
he cited a case in the mid-'s when police used the hate law to arrest protesters at a shriner's parade in toronto who carried signs saying """"yankee go home
the problem, says borovoy, is that """"hatred is a vague concept """"where does strong dislike end and hatred begin?
meanwhile, shiv chopra, president of the national capital alliance on race relations, said demonstrations such as saturday's anti-racist protest can backfire, detracting from the anti-racist message
it's more important for politicians to attack systemic racism, to prevent groups such as heritage front from flourishing, he said
the ottawa-carleton boys and girls club, where saturday's dance was held, is looking at how to prevent groups such as heritage front from renting club space club officials say they didn't know who was sponsoring the dance
local hotels also will be tightening security, said peter howard, president of ottawa hoteliers inc, representing ottawa's major hotels and ottawa mayor jacquelin holzman has asked city administrators to review procedures for renting city property to private groups

1124635432,From policy wonk to prime minister; Sheila Pratt looks at the Reform party's 25-year journey from the outside to the centre of political power in Canada,"In three years, Liberal finance minister Paul Martin balanced the budget, and """"since 2002, there (have been) a series of tax cuts by both (Liberal and Conservative) governments - GST, corporate tax, personal income tax breaks,"""" Flanagan said.","  for the last few years, preston manning has headed to ottawa each march for a major huddle of the country's conservative establishment
more than  showed up last year for the manning networking conference - old time reformers, cabinet ministers and conservative caucus members, think tanks, activists and lobbyists all gathered at the congress centre in the capital's downtown the topics on the table included energy policy, national defence and moving beyond the welfare state prime minister stephen harper gave a speech
it's a high-profile event that illustrates the enduring links between the two key political figures of the last two decades, manning and harper - the old reform movement and the new conservative government
twenty-five years ago, manning was in charge, leading a western protest movement to ottawa and stephen harper was the hardworking, behind-the-scenes policy wonk the roles have reversed with harper in the prime minister's office while manning continues to build the base in new think tanks - on campuses, in cities and in business circles
manning and harper rode the winds of change out of the west in the late s, bringing about major change on the political landscape the conservatives are back in power after years on the sidelines, the old progressive conservatives no longer exist, the liberal party is in tatters and the country may well be on the way to a polarized, two-party system with the new democrats on the left
a handful of the young turks who started in the late s with manning are still there; among them jason kenney, john baird and diane ablonczy
manning said he's proudest of bringing fiscal conservatism - balanced budgets and lower taxes - to ottawa he's also happy there's been a shift in canada's centre of gravity, putting alberta's energy economy at the centre of the country
""""the old centre was rooted in an unspoken alliance between ontario and quebec,"""" manning said """"and on may , , (the last federal election) that shifted to a new alignment between ontario and the west""""
manning's reform party can certainly take credit for changing the policy direction of the country in the s, said tom flanagan, long-time party insider and political science professor at the university of calgary
pressured by  reform mps storming out of the west in , the liberal government adopted much of manning's fiscal agenda - balancing the budget, paying down debt and lowering taxes, flanagan said
in three years, liberal finance minister paul martin balanced the budget, and """"since , there (have been) a series of tax cuts by both (liberal and conservative) governments - gst, corporate tax, personal income tax breaks,"""" flanagan said
reformers can also take credit for stiffening the country's backbone in dealing with the separatists, he said after the nearly disastrous  referendum on quebec sovereignty, a young reform mp named stephen harper introduced a private member's bill - the precursor to the clarity act later put forward by the liberals, which put conditions around quebec separation
link byfield, former publisher of alberta report and an early champion of reform, said manning's greatest achievement was blowing up the old pc party, which paved the way for the hard-nosed harper to put together the new conservative party to win government
""""we lost our populism but we did retain a right-wing approach under harper,"""" said byfield """"it's a very different party but it's truly a conservative party in spirit and policy to a great degree""""
harper as prime minister had to learn to temper his ideological approach, byfield said
""""most people in the country don't want radical change, they don't trust it and you have to respect that preston, the populist, knew that and harper had to learn that lesson when he was in office where harper used to bring aggressiveness to policy, he now brings it to partisanship""""
critics, however, say harper has moved a long way from those populist reform roots
after passing the accountability act, harper quickly turned his back on """"the reform promise of open, accountable and transparent government,"""" said edmonton strathcona new democrat mp linda duncan, currently the only non-conservative mp elected in alberta
harper's use of omnibus bills - combining all sorts of proposed policy into one big budget bill - is just one new strategy to avoid detailed scrutiny by parliamentary committees, said duncan this government is the most secretive ever, she said """"we can't even find out what departments the government is going to cut""""
ralph goodale, former liberal finance minister and the only liberal to win a seat in saskatchewan last year, also doubts public opinion is shifting right harper's success, he said, was founded on """"divide and conquer"""" tactics, not persuasion or building consensus
harper has perfected wedge politics, which is how he got a majority of seats on less than  per cent of popular vote
""""i think his purpose is to kneecap the federal government,"""" goodale said the prime minister quickly abandoned manning's democratic reforms that called for free votes and independent committees said goodale but his biggest betrayal of the manning legacy comes in fiscal policy, he said
manning called for balanced budgets in the  election, and the liberals delivered for  years
then-finance minister paul martin brought in major spending cuts over the next three years in , goodale, by then finance minister, had built up a healthy treasury with a $-billion surplus but he said within two years, all that was squandered by harper
steve patton, a political scientist at the university of alberta and expert in populist politics, said the country's political culture was already shifting uneasily in the late s when manning and harper came along
those regional tensions grew in the wake of the failed meech lake and charlottetown accords which proposed special status for quebec it all gave impetus to manning's """"the west wants in,"""" he said
also in the early s, voices on the right were getting louder, calling for an end to big government, big deficits and big spending, patton said
""""one of the pivotal moments of canadian politics was the  budget, when paul martin turned the liberal party on its head and introduced his most conservative budget manning had been pushing for that """"
""""manning shook up the political scene, he built legitimacy for ideas that were more marginalized, and harnessed western alienation he gave legitimacy to another view of canada that rejected the liberal view of official biculturalism, big government and even multiculturalism,"""" said patton

Yvon Courcy and his wife Diane Doucet founded the first Vision school in Drummondville in 1995 out of frustration with the quality of English-language instruction available in Quebec's public school system. Courcy has studied and taught foreign languages at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke, the University of Mexico, Spain and Morocco. Outside Montreal, the surge in enrolment of Law 101-eligible francophone students is sustaining virtually all English public schools whether it be in the Gaspe, the Eastern Townships or Quebec City. In these areas it is now normal that children from francophone families account for a strong majority of the student population. So, under this symbiotic relationship, anglophones get to keep their schools open thanks to franco-phones.","five new english schools are to open in quebec next year, in places like thetford mines, kingsey falls and levis
they are not springing up because of any noticeable spike in the english population; these towns are about as thoroughly french- speaking as they come in quebec they are arising out of a grassroots demand for english-language education coming from francophone parents the catch, of course, is that these are private schools, where an annual tuition of as much as $, will buy the attentive student a ticket to the bilingual stars
these are the vision schools, now numbering six already up and enrolling - in quebec city, trois-rivieres, the eastern townships towns of warwick, victoriaville and drummondville, and varennes (on montreal's south shore) - with five more announced and accepting applications for next september's school term
schools are also slated to be open for classes in  in sherbrooke and st augustine de desmaures, a suburb of quebec city
all vision schools, according to their literature, also have compulsory instruction in spanish in a curriculum, otherwise taught in english, totaling  per cent more hours of teaching than the average public school that means that after six years of elementary school, vision students have had the equivalent of grade  in the public system
french also is a key component of the program and students must meet the same standards in grade  as they would in the public system
yvon courcy and his wife diane doucet founded the first vision school in drummondville in  out of frustration with the quality of english-language instruction available in quebec's public school system courcy has studied and taught foreign languages at bishop's university in sherbrooke, the university of mexico, spain and morocco
the vision schools and a few others like them are tapping into the growing market of ambitious parents who want to make sure their children are able to speak english well enough to compete in a world where the language of shakespeare is the lingua franca
virtually all these parents do not have the right to send their children to public english schools, a measure of law  initially intended to bar the children of immigrants from attending english schools
private english schools - or german or hebrew schools, for that matter - are accepted in quebec but do not receive any government subsidies if they do not conform to ministry of education regulations parents willing to pony up for private schools have sustained several well-known institutions in the province for decades, including lower canada college and selwyn house in montreal, and stanstead college and bishops college school in the eastern townships
while the burgeoning demand for english education from francophone parents has spawned a private school network, it has also had a huge impact on the public sector this september a new english public school opened in quebec city, something that has not been seen in decades everest school took over an abandoned former french public school and welcomed upwards of  students
outside montreal, the surge in enrolment of law -eligible francophone students is sustaining virtually all english public schools whether it be in the gaspe, the eastern townships or quebec city in these areas it is now normal that children from francophone families account for a strong majority of the student population so, under this symbiotic relationship, anglophones get to keep their schools open thanks to franco-phones
the percentage of francophones attending english public schools across the province has more than doubled in recent years across the province francophones make up about  per cent of enrolments in english public schools, or about , students
there is a bit of a trade-off in that about , english mother- tongue students attend french schools, but they only amount to a drop in the linguistic bucket - less than two per cent of the entire francophone enrolment
critics of this boomlet in english education in quebec blame the provincial government for the situation they say the quality of english-language instruction is so poor in french schools that francophones have been driven to desperate measures the shortage of good english teachers, the limited number of hours of instruction and the lateness of when english teaching starts are all factors
the charest government plans to make english compulsory starting in the first grade of elementary school, which should help the situation somewhat but what seems more likely to happen is the hundreds of vision school graduates will go on to private secondary schools like the vision high school already operating in victoria- ville
vision schools, and others, are responding to a political situation that appears blind to public demand

what sells best overseas, it seems, are shows that aren't identifiably canadian tv is now truly a global village, ridding itself of specific local references in pursuit of ever larger international audiences
there are exceptions, of course road to avonlea, due south and made-for-tv movies dieppe and conspiracy of silence could not have been made anywhere else
but by-and-large, canadian producers have adapted with vigor to the demands of the new market and they're doing spectacularly well
``what matters is genre, not location,'' says ted riley, president of atlantis releasing, the distribution wing of toronto production company atlantis films ``and family programs don't sell as well as action/adventure programs
``the business is now international, a matter of forming strategic partnerships with co-producers and foreign broadcasters
``the industry is tending to shy away from the canadian skyline, unless it's a cop-thriller that could be set anywhere the canadian broadcast industry doesn't have the appetite for indigenous canadian shows,'' riley adds
``the cultural integrity of our airwaves was compromised a long time ago and the world market is now driven by where a show plays on the us (tv) schedule a show has to be exceptional to get beyond that''
rola zayed, who runs toronto's alliance marketing office in paris, agrees
``a combination of north american and european sensibilities makes tv shows marketable''
but trudy grant, president of sullivan international begs to differ (she has sold such intrinsically canadian sullivan entertainment shows as anne of green gables, road to avonlea, and the tv-movies butterbox babies, lantern hill, looking for miracles and by way of the stars to some  countries)
``if you make quality programs, they'll sell anywhere my shows happen to be indigenous, but in the end, they sell - even in china (sullivan has sold  hours of programming there in the past year; disney has yet to get a foothold) and japan - because quality is what matters
``family programming doesn't exclude action and adventure''
here's a list of canada's top-selling tv shows - and ideas - in the past  months in the us, britain, europe, australia, and in the burgeoning south american and asian markets
* alliance communications' biggies, sold in most parts of the world, are the tv newsroom drama eng; due south (``americans and europeans love the self-deprecating humor of due south,'' zayed says ``it's scheduled always in prime time, which is rare for foreign programs'') and the computer-animated show reboot, a cross-generational hit on pbs in the us it's unique in the world of animation and sells particularly well in asia
* atlantis' hits outside canada are the ray bradbury theatre, sold in more than  countries, the family channel series mysterious island ( countries); the outer limits, distributed by mgm (``it's no  in the world,'' riley says); sci-fi series tekwar; and the uniquely canadian tv movie the diviners, based on margaret laurence's popular novel
* toronto's breakthrough productions, a small independent company, is responsible for what may be our most visible export, the pre-school kids' hit dudley the dragon, which has also spawned a massive merchandising enterprise now into its fourth season, dudley is seen on  pbs stations in the us,, reaching about  per cent of the market there
breakthrough president peter williamson says that while dudley, which features regular performances by well-known canadian stars graham greene, eric peterson, and carl johnson, among others, is aimed at an international audience, ``the social values presented in the program are canadian the stories are influenced by the canadian experience with multiculturalism, native culture, the environment and the characters, dudley aside, are based on canadian animals it's very obviously set in a bc rainforest''
breakthrough in the past year has also produced the critically acclaimed tv-movie coming of age, starring jan rubes, and the hit cooking series what's for dinner? both have sold well in european and other tv markets
* cbc-tv's top international sellers in the past year are david suzuki's science program the nature of things; the action series danger bay and drama series street legal; fashion file; the miniseries love and hate: the joann and colin thatcher story; and the tv-movie liar, liar, starring art hindle as a sexually abusive father
other cbc hits outside canada include beachcombers (europe, australasia, south africa); the broadcast tapes of dr peter (us, japan, uk); conspiracy of silence (europe, australia); dieppe (us, europe); the fifth estate (us, the caribbean, south america, japan); and man alive
* canada is particularly strong in the production of french-language programs ( scoop, les filles de caleb, blanche and most quebec-produced music and variety specials sell extremely well in europe) and of animated, live-action,and educational programming for children
export leaders are montreal's cinar, which counts among its top  exports the busy world of richard scarry (a co-production with france, sold in  countries); the live-action ``tweens'' hit are you afraid of the dark? (seen here on ytv and in the us on the nickelodeon specialty channel); the animated program real stories; the series the legend of white fang and stop the snoggies
* toronto-based nelvana is also a major exporter of kids' animated, educational, and family programming, with jim henson's dog city; rupert ( countries); tales from the crypt keeper; the magic school bus (featuring lily tomlin and seen in the us on pbs); care bears; cadillacs and dinosaurs; jim lee's wild ca,ts; the adventures of tin-tin; and babar
* andrew cochran and associates in halifax has an international hit - both in broadcast and video sales - with the educational show theodore tugboat
* big comfy couch, produced in toronto by radical sheep productions and seen here on ytv, is also a major seller in foreign tv markets
paragon, based in toronto and los angeles, is not only a producer but also a distributor high on its list of international sales are the teen drama series ready or not! (produced for canwest global by toronto's insight productions and seen in the us on showtime, and also in britain, france, and germany) paragon's own lamb chop's play-along is a pbs hit in the us, and sells as well in asia, and in most english- speaking countries around the world
paragon also distributes animated programs internationally made by lacewood productions - katie & orbie (kids' pre-school), and the obviously canadian special for better or for worse, based on lynn johnston's popular comic strip
* tvontario is now a world leader in production and sales of educational programs, mostly in us sales of curriculum programs not seen outside classrooms they include concepts in science, today's special, nature watch, read all about it, take a look, polka dot door, parlez moi, read along, concepts in math and the science program eureka
but it's not just canadian programs that sell in other markets city-tv is actually selling itself, the very idea of local tv

spain is a case in point according to data from the european union, it had an unemployment rate of  per cent last fall, followed by greece with  per cent
take away the few european countries which are still prospering, such as germany, austria, holland and finland, and the unemployment rate across the eu was more than double that of canada, which announced an unemployment rate of  per cent last week
the figures in europe were far worse for those under the age of 
spain again led the way with a staggering youth unemployment rate of  per cent, followed by greece with  per cent, compared to a rate of about  per cent in canada
given those appalling european numbers and immigration minister jason kenney's stated goal of taking in , immigrants this year, it is in canada's national interest to modify existing programs or create a new program to specifically headhunt tens of thousands of highly educated but unemployed or underemployed europeans of special importance should be the large number of young europeans who already speak english and/or french well and who possess sophisticated computer skills or have solid mechanical, engineering and scientific backgrounds
again and again as i travelled last month by train from italy through france, spain, belgium, germany and poland, checking the continent's feeble economic pulse, sometimes desperate and always despairing europeans complained to me about how, despite top notch schooling, their job prospects were extremely limited or non-existent
a few of those i spoke with, such as a -year-old female apprentice car mechanic from perpignan, in southern france, had friends who had emigrated to canada and were encouraging her to join them
a -year-old quadrilingual hotel clerk in belgium with a graduate degree in international relations who aspired to become a teacher complained that ottawa did not seem to want europeans
he and others questioned why, from where they sat, canada seemed to give preferential treatment to asian and middle eastern migrants
as the result of policies established during by liberal governments in the s, which greatly diversified the pool of immigrants eligible to settle in canada and actively sought them from new places, it takes far fewer immigrants from europe today
in , the most recent year for which citizenship and immigration canada as well as statistics canada have published data, the country took in , asians and , europeans

it was not always like this, of course canada took in , european immigrants and only , from asia in 
as late as , canada welcomed , newcomers from europe compared to , from asia however, only  years later, the balance had shifted dramatically in asia's favour, with about , more immigrants from the far east and south asia than from europe
europeans represented  per cent of canada's intake of immigrants in 
half a century later, the percentage of european immigrants to canada had plummeted to about  per cent of the total
looked at another way, canada has taken in almost  million more immigrants from asia than from europe since 
over the past  years, the number of immigrants from africa and the middle east has also greatly surpassed immigration from europe, growing nearly six-fold to nearly , last year during this same period, the intake of immigrants from central america and south america grew, although not by as much
anecdotal reports from canadian posts overseas suggest the number of europeans emigrating to canada is now growing slightly but there are no figures yet to support this contention
canada did well when it encouraged immigration from europe, just as it has done well recently by encouraging immigrants from elsewhere
however, factors that propel immigration change over time it would be a boon to canada if it were to redirect a few of its heavily asia-centric immigration resources to europe and, for the first time in decades, actively seek more immigrants from among the deep pool of highly capable europeans who are in an economic pickle and are keen to take their talents elsewhere

""""We are in favour of an aboriginal justice being appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and beyond that, if there is a way to appoint First Nations in the selection of the judiciary, we would even want that to happen. The Constitution itself recognizes that we are not just another minority in Canada, that we are not just a special interest group. Aboriginal people have definite traditions and world views that you really wouldn't understand unless you were raised and steeped in those world views."""" The lack of aboriginal jurists on a court with such a heavy caseload of complex high-stakes aboriginal cases has been condemned as an embarrassment and disgrace by many non-aboriginal constitutional scholars, such as Peter Hogg and Peter Russell, and by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. There are more than 700 aboriginal Canadians who hold law degrees, but only about two dozen aboriginal judges across Canada. Last year, Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Harry La Forme became the first aboriginal elevated to an appellate court.","some members fear bar association move would amount to 'racial profiling'
amidst charges from some of its members that it is veering into """"racial profiling,"""" the canadian bar association will decide this week if it should join the assembly of first nations in lobbying for the appointment of a qualified aboriginal jurist to the supreme court of canada
the prestigious association of , judges and lawyers will vote at its annual meeting in vancouver next weekend on whether to press the government to appoint native jurists to the appellate courts, including the top court, where a vacancy opens up next december
but many lawyers, including the bar association's quebec branch, are uncomfortable with the proposed move because it calls for the appointment of jurists who are aboriginal, rather than simply jurists who are well-versed in aboriginal legal traditions
""""should race be a factor in an appointment to the supreme court of canada? many lawyers have a deep-seated discomfort at such a notion,"""" admits supreme court expert eugene meehan, a former canadian bar association president

the goal of getting native representation on a court that decides aboriginal rights and treaties is seen as so vital by the assembly of first nations that its national chief, phil fontaine, wants to address the bar association's national council on the subject next weekend in advance of the meeting, the assembly is also drafting an op-ed piece for the globe and mail

canadian bar association president susan mcgrath stressed that no one wants an unqualified aboriginal jurist to be appointed a controversial suggestion last year that one seat on the nine-member court be reserved for an aboriginal has also been dropped
""""the new resolution is very clear that it is not looking at any kind of quota system,"""" ms mcgrath explained """"it reaffirms our position that appointments are to be made on the basis of merit, as well as taking into consideration other factors such as diversity and multiculturalism""""

the risk for the government is that it courts a backlash from voters annoyed at being pushed into what looks like an opportunistic election  / months before the fourth anniversary of the  vote -- and nearly  months before the current mandate absolutely expires call it the david peterson syndrome, after the ontario liberal premier who, riding high in the polls, called an election in , three years into his term, only to be trounced by bob rae ndp
forget it the chretien liberals will argue the comparison is invalid; for one thing, what real difference does three months make between june and a fall election?
for another, unlike the peterson government, whose legislative record was skimpy, the federal grits are boasting they have some major accomplishments under their belt and now is the time to turn the page
rapid deficit-cutting, the lowest interest rates in more than a generation, a restructuring of the social security system including major reforms to both public pensions and employment insurance, open skies air transport deregulation across the us-canadian border, devolution of manpower training, tourism, forestry and mines to the provinces, and so on
so it is that, just to smooth the way in key battlegrounds such as ontario and bc, the chretien team is busy fixing long-standing irritants with the country most right-wing and left-wing governments, mike harris aloof administration at queen park and glen clark periodically belligerent regime in victoria
ontario is getting additional federal funding for immigrant resettlement, aimed at closing down the province repeated claims that the federal government does not treat it fairly it will amount to a -per-cent increase that should go a long way to answering ontario bitter complaint that in recent years the province has received only  per cent of federal immigration money even though it takes in more than  per cent of the nation immigrants -- while quebec gets the same amount to handle  per cent of the immigrants
the beauty of the immigration deal is that behind the scenes it was a key factor in ending ontario finance minister ernie eves refusal to sign onto paul martin canada pension plan reform package, without which it could not proceed and eves endorsement, however reluctant, gives the federal liberals a handy political shield against attacks from reform preston manning and federal tory leader jean charest that the federal government has perpetrated a major tax hike, ``the biggest tax grab in history,'' as manning calls it
by the same token, alberta outgoing treasurer, jim dinning, has been a fervent advocate of the move to stabilize the cpp with higher contributions
as well, in return for extra immigration money for bc, the grits are settling the biggest outstanding dispute with that province, namely its court action against the federal government for withholding $ million in annual social transfers the federal transfer cut has been meted out against bc as punishment for imposing in  a three-month residency requirement against welfare claimants who have moved to the west coast from another province
bc action violated a key condition of the federal government canada health and social transfer, which is full mobility rights for welfare recipients as they move from province to province
but bc complained it had no option but to restrict welfare entitlements since the chretien liberals had continued the previous mulroney administration practice of unilaterally shortchanging the big provinces to save money and fight the deficit
clark open hostility to the chretien government over the last year was seen internally as a major electoral liability for the liberals on the west coast even as hopes flourished for a major breakthrough in the next election which is why chretien and his office have devoted considerable time and energy to the province lately, and to wooing clark himself the belief now is that the ndp is at least somewhat neutralized
with the unemployment picture unlikely to improve dramatically this year, and us interest rates poised to start climbing, why delay?

 another viral infection in circulation is mild in children but worse for teens and adults pregnant women, should they contract the disease, risk serious birth defects and potential fetal death eighty-five per cent of canadians contracted this disease before age  childbearing women were at greatest risk in , there were , cases the vaccine has reduced this to about , cases per year local pockets of unvaccinated and partially immune people contribute to these remaining cases
 a strain of bacteria lurks ready to kill one in  infected canadians (despite treatment) if we let our guard down as they did in the former soviet union the bacterium produces a toxin that causes the throat to swell and forms a thick filmy membrane large enough to suffocate its victim the toxin can damage the heart, kidneys and nerves
the vaccine, developed in , reduced the number of canadian cases in  from , to fewer than two to five per year since 
 in ,  million people from canada, the united states, the former soviet union, western europe, australia and new zealand contracted a disease that permanently damages nerve cells in the spinal cord, leading to leg or arm paralysis and, in some cases, death
about one in  suffering from the disease develops paralysis, and , people succumbed to this complication that year the vaccine became available in  by , the number of cases for the year was , for those same countries, a reduction of more than  per cent the last case in canada was in 
people respond to immediate threats the aforementioned diseases were the sars of their time: front-page diseases our senior citizens can attest to the fear and dread they felt when their children fell ill they asked questions about treatment and vaccines then similar to those we ask now
common childhood infectious diseases are no longer on the front page because of vaccines and public risk-reduction strategies these other diseases are by any reasonable standard worse than sars -- but our radar no longer registers these threats
indeed, some choose not to vaccinate their children some do not trust pharmaceutical companies, fear perceived vaccine side-effects or do not think there is any need to vaccinate given that the radar screen remains relatively clear
if we choose to be complacent about our social responsibility and forget about the reasons our children no longer face traumatic and life-threatening illness, we will face health risks greater than sars
public health is not a fait accompli it must be evidence-based, consistently applied throughout our society and accepted by everyone if it is to have an impact there is justification to the public's demand to ensure the safety of canadians indeed, witness the latest hullabaloo about the lack of airport screening and thermal detection (fever) units to intercept potential sars carriers
refusal to vaccinate children and poor health screening procedures for refugees and immigrants for hepatitis b ( million carriers) and tuberculosis (two billion people worldwide) put everyone at risk it is akin to removing the airport screening systems and public health initiatives thereby increasing the community's risk of illness
two  studies in the canadian medical association journal support this argument foreign-born individuals, the majority emigrating from asian countries, accounted for  per cent of the tuberculosis cases in alberta over a five-year period the average period between immigration to canada and diagnosis was  years a montreal study reported similar findings
there must be a consistent approach to disease prevention it is not a boutique where we choose which diseases we wish to prevent
answers:  measles  rubella  diphtheria  poliomyelitis

241168772,A return to tolerance,"Does this mean """"the end of tolerance,"""" to borrow an editorial headline in the Sunday Times? The answer has to be yes, if we are referring to the kind of hyper-tolerance that breeds intolerance. As the newspaper noted, only in western countries, with their traditions of tolerance, have """"extremist factions been given the space to spout anti-western hatred."""" Indeed, that is exactly what has happened. The West experiment to create the """"maximally tolerant society,"""" to borrow philosopher David Stove phrase, has, paradoxically, allowed the emergence in western societies of those who want a """"maximally intolerant society."""" For nearly five decades postmodern intellectuals have claimed that the assimilation of non-western immigrants is wrong because it presumes the superiority of western culture. These cultural relativists insist that the contemporary West, with its hard-won heritage of the rule of law, political freedom and individual rights, is no better than those cultures that remain tyrannical, violent and oppressive. The result has been a """"therapeutic multiculturalism,"""" to borrow philosopher Michael Walzer phrase, that promotes the relativity of all cultures and values. But this relativistic multiculturalism amounts to a de facto surrender of those values and traditions that are the very source of tolerance. Therapeutic multiculturalism, says Walzer, threatens to undermine """"every sort of common identity and standard behaviour,"""" creating """"postmodern vagabonds"""" who """"may not be the most tolerant fellow citizens."""" Tolerance, rightly understood, demonstrates """"patience toward a practice or opinion one disapproves of,"""" say ethicists Brad Stetson and Joseph Conti. But it also implies limits to tolerance. """"Tolerance allows for prudent moral criticism and strongly held individual belief."""" That is to say, because toleration is invariably connected to moral judgment, it requires a willingness to confront competing views about the best political and social order. Put bluntly, tolerance cannot be, as it so often is now, an excuse for moral cowardice. Treacly invocations of """"difference,"""" """"diversity"""" and """"mutual respect"""" are a cop-out, the rhetoric of those who have no convictions. Real tolerance, say Stetson and Conti, is a """"moral tool"""" for the building and maintenance of civic order.","  our quest for a 'maximally tolerant society,' which presumes all beliefs are equally correct and valid, has allowed intolerance to flourish genuine toleration presumes disagreement, accompanied by mutual respect
it is about competing views, not an excuse for moral cowardice it demonstrates the possession of values,
and the willingness to defend them and a society uncertain about its values will be incapable in the long run of toleration
complete moral tolerance is possible only when men have become completely indifferent to each other  that is to say, when society is at an end if, on the other hand, every struggle is treated as a war of extermination, society will come to an end in a shorter and more exciting manner, but not more decisively a healthy state of things will be a compromise between the two
--james fitzjames stephen, liberty, equality, fraternity, 
the virtue of toleration has been much abused in recent decades the original notion of toleration, the toleration promoted by political thinkers such john locke and james stephen, was based on two assumptions: that humans are flawed creatures, and that freedom is a necessary requirement for a flourishing life
recognizing the impossibility of human perfection, these early moderns understood that genuine toleration is a hard-won habit it is not easy to put up with the views, values and activities of those with whom we disagree, and of whom we might even disapprove yet, for men like locke, toleration, rightly understood, is a necessary precondition for any stable, orderly and decent way of life among imperfectible creatures
unfortunately, this minimalist concept of toleration is not good enough nowadays the classical idea of toleration is unfashionable, in part at least, because society as a whole no longer accepts the christian notion of humans as inherently flawed and prone to evil we tend to think that all we need to create the perfect world and establish universal peace is the correct social program, the right government or the latest technological fix the idea that we have to """"tolerate"""" our imperfection is, well, intolerable
indeed, dissatisfied with tolerance as a virtuous habit of patience and forbearance, we've tried to sidestep the need for it though various attempts to overcome our flawed nature whether through politics or pills, biotechnology or behavioural modification, we seek to order human experience in terms of safe, comfortable and passive contentment as philosopher john gray puts it: """"grounded as it is in accepting the imperfectability of the human lot, (classical) toleration is bound to be uncongenial to the ruling illusions of the epoch, all of which cherish the project of instituting a political providence in human affairs whereby tragedy and mystery would be banished""""
one result, as i argued earlier in this series, has been the inflation of tolerance into hyper-toleration; that is, extreme toleration in which all lifestyles, beliefs, cultural practices and moral claims are, in theory, recognized, esteemed and validated because all are equal why this is a problem and what can be done about it is the focus of this last essay the place to start is with the idea of multiculturalism because it is the form through which toleration is most fully manifested in our society

in canada, the charter of rights and freedoms officially enshrines multiculturalism in the constitution imposed on the country by the liberals, the idea was to create a new canadian identity that would weaken the centrifugal forces that tended to fragment the country, particularly the tension between french- and english-speaking canadians by and large, the country elites think it worked, for a time at least in the words of philosopher daniel marc weinstock, canadian multiculturalism is """"a remarkable success"""" for having """"woven a highly diverse population, drawn from the four corners of the planet, into a peaceful, prosperous and remarkable cohesive society""""
yet, weinstock acknowledges that recent demands by some minorities have gone beyond the soft multiculturalism of past decades -- what multicultural bureaucrats call the """"three fs: fun, food, and fashion"""" -- to the hard multiculturalism of wanting """"exemptions from laws and policies applying to the broader society"""" in order to """"make room for the precepts that they derive from their religions"""" even environics pollster michael adams, while finding canadians generally support multiculturalism, concedes many """"are indeed starting to worry that this country may have bitten off more than it can chew when it comes to the integration of newcomers of vastly different religious, cultural and ideological backgrounds""""
so it seems the herouxville controversy, the bouchard-taylor commission on """"reasonable accommodation,"""" the religious undercurrent in the recent ontario election -- these are not isolated phenomena taken together they suggest that four decades of multiculturalism are beginning to produce tensions they were supposed to prevent according to the magazine the walrus, canadians """"are far from sanguine about the country increasing diversity"""" citing a  strategic council study that  per pent of those surveyed think canada is accepting too many immigrants, the magazine concludes that """"to some extent, it seems that canadians, like their brethren in europe, australia, and elsewhere, have had their fill of multiculturalism, hyphenated citizenship, and the like  there is also growing evidence that canada fabled mosaic is actually fracturing into community self-segregation by ethnic group""""
the toronto star recently offered an example of """"enclave"""" thinking when it reported hindus in canada were upset at regulations that prohibit them from dumping the ashes of their dead in canadian rivers reporter prithi yelaja, citing a ryerson university study, wrote, """"rigid provincial and municipal regulations regarding funerals and burials, created primarily to accommodate western judeo-christian customs, are forcing faith communities to adjust to the law rather than have the freedom to practise their final rites""""
the reference to judeo-christian customs is telling the reporter implies that existing regulations are culturally relative, and it is only the biases of """"judeo-christians,"""" who, by an accident of history got here first, that are preventing hindus from doing as they wish such a slant suggests that some in the hindu community regard multiculturalism as a one-way street, a policy that allows them accept only those canadian laws and traditions that suit their purposes, but to otherwise avoid integration into the mainstream of canadian society
---
this not what the originators of multiculturalism intended, of course, they saw multiculturalism as a way to promote tolerance, to ease the integration of immigrants into western societies, both for their own good and that of the host country but good intentions often produce flawed results in the case of multiculturalism, says martin collacott, a former canadian diplomat, the result has been """"the expectation among many members of immigrant communities that canada is committed to accepting and adapting to whatever traditions, beliefs and practices they bring with them""""
nearly  years later, even some of the original architects of multiculturalism are rethinking the issue in , bernard ostry, the former senior public servant responsible for drafting and implementing the federal multicultural policies in the s, acknowledged that a policy aimed at helping immigrants to better participate in canadian life is now being criticized for having had the opposite effect of encouraging minorities """"to retreat to their own corners""""
but it not just canada where the shibboleths of hyper-tolerant multiculturalism are being challenged european countries, including germany, france, spain and italy, have introduced, or intend to introduce, measures that impose greater obligations on immigrants to adopt the customs of their host countries in , then-british prime minister tony blair effectively pronounced the end of hyper-tolerant multiculturalism in the united kingdom, saying immigrants have """"a duty"""" to integrate into the mainstream of society """"conform to it; or don't come here  if you are permitted to stay here permanently, you become an equal member of our community and become one of us""""
the british government recently followed through on blair admonishment, announcing new immigration rules that will place those seeking british citizenship on probation for at least a year to show they can speak english, pay taxes, obey the law and, perhaps most importantly, """"integrate into local life"""" the government is concerned that immigrants who don't integrate into british society foster conditions that can, as one news report put it, """"lead to intolerance""""
does this mean """"the end of tolerance,"""" to borrow an editorial headline in the sunday times? the answer has to be yes, if we are referring to the kind of hyper-tolerance that breeds intolerance as the newspaper noted, only in western countries, with their traditions of tolerance, have """"extremist factions been given the space to spout anti-western hatred"""" indeed, that is exactly what has happened the west experiment to create the """"maximally tolerant society,"""" to borrow philosopher david stove phrase, has, paradoxically, allowed the emergence in western societies of those who want a """"maximally intolerant society""""
interestingly, some muslim commentators make exactly this argument """"as westerners bow down before multiculturalism, we anesthetize ourselves into believing that anything goes,"""" writes irshad manji, a commentator who been the recipient of death threats for criticizing radical islam """"we see our readiness to accommodate as a strength -- even a form of cultural superiority (though few will admit that) radical muslims, on the other hand, see our inclusive instincts as a form of corruption that makes us soft and rudderless the more we accommodate to placate, the more their contempt for our 'weakness' grows"""" the ultimate paradox, manji says, may be that defending diversity will require westerners """"to be less tolerant""""
two muslim scholars, haideh moghissi and shahrzad mojab, iranian-born academics who teach, respectively, at york university and the university of toronto, echo this view in a recently published an online essay, they argue that too many people in the west bow to the demands the """"rigid totalitarian ultraconservative islam"""" in the name """"respecting their cultural heritage"""" this, they say, """"is to give up on principles of citizens' equality before the law and the hard-won norms of women rights still worse, tip-toeing around the harmful cultural practices as some left and feminists are doing is tolerating for others what is intolerable to 'us'""""
the two academics denounce those who allow their vaunted tolerance to promote intolerance """"the fact is that in canada we are facing a very serious and growing problem of the rise of religious zealotry canadian multiculturalism, failing to combat racism and muslim-phobia, is gradually moving towards adopting faith-based multiculturalism, allowing the formation of cultural ghettoes immune from social and legal scrutiny against violations of human rights""""
---
there is irony in this situation multiculturalism is rooted in a concept of tolerance conceived by western philosophers yet, contemporary postmodern thinkers teach that western societies are inherently racist, imperialist and proto-totalitarian (not to mention phallocentric, homophobic, etc) the achievements of the west -- the rule of law, democratic government, individual rights, equality of opportunity, economic affluence, etc -- are deliberately depreciated and excoriated
for nearly five decades postmodern intellectuals have claimed that the assimilation of non-western immigrants is wrong because it presumes the superiority of western culture these cultural relativists insist that the contemporary west, with its hard-won heritage of the rule of law, political freedom and individual rights, is no better than those cultures that remain tyrannical, violent and oppressive the result has been a """"therapeutic multiculturalism,"""" to borrow philosopher michael walzer phrase, that promotes the relativity of all cultures and values but this relativistic multiculturalism amounts to a de facto surrender of those values and traditions that are the very source of tolerance therapeutic multiculturalism, says walzer, threatens to undermine """"every sort of common identity and standard behaviour,"""" creating """"postmodern vagabonds"""" who """"may not be the most tolerant fellow citizens""""
unfortunately, this imprudent thinking has infected the public mind with uncertainty and doubt regarding western values and achievements so much so, says philosopher roger scruton, that """"western societies are experiencing an acute crisis of identity"""" many westerners no longer conceive of themselves according to the enlightenment ideal as rational creatures capable of rising above the limitations of birth, culture or geography now they assume their sense of identity, their sense of belonging, is tied to a particular religion, ethnic group or lifestyle community this is a reversion to tribalism and to the degree postmodern multiculturalism fosters this new tribalism, it threatens the west liberal heritage
the retention and continuance of that heritage requires putting an end to the self-flagellating psychology of anti-western postmodernism one small step in this direction is the recovery of toleration, properly conceived genuine toleration presumes disagreement this disagreement, however, is accompanied a willingness to treat the one with whom you disagree decently and respectfully that doesn't mean, as the postmodern multicultists insist, that you are required to support, nourish, esteem or validate beliefs or lifestyles with which you disagree
tolerance, rightly understood, demonstrates """"patience toward a practice or opinion one disapproves of,"""" say ethicists brad stetson and joseph conti but it also implies limits to tolerance """"tolerance allows for prudent moral criticism and strongly held individual belief"""" that is to say, because toleration is invariably connected to moral judgment, it requires a willingness to confront competing views about the best political and social order put bluntly, tolerance cannot be, as it so often is now, an excuse for moral cowardice treacly invocations of """"difference,"""" """"diversity"""" and """"mutual respect"""" are a cop-out, the rhetoric of those who have no convictions real tolerance, say stetson and conti, is a """"moral tool"""" for the building and maintenance of civic order
---
political scientist philip resnick applies this criteria of tolerance to the canadian context when he says """"canadians need to put some water into their multicultural wine and stop celebrating  the gifts of difference"""" they need to be more hardnosed in """"emphasizing what core canadian values really are instead of making of diversity an end in itself"""" canada """"is not a blank slate to be reinvented with each new immigrant or group of immigrants that arrives at our airports""""
indeed, canada values -- peace, order, constitutional government, individual freedom and equality before the law -- are grounded in the political and social traditions of its western european heritage therapeutic multiculturalism, the multiculturalism that makes everyone feel good about themselves, is no substitute, says resnick, """"for a civic consciousness in which ethnic, religious, or racial origins take second place to the things we share as canadians; or for core political values""""
on this view, then, toleration does not, as the postmodernists would have it, reflect doubt or uncertainty about our ability to proclaim values rather, it demonstrates the possession of values, and the willingness to defend them as john gray puts it, """"a tolerant man does not doubt that he knows something about the good and the true; his tolerance expresses that knowledge"""" equally, the truly tolerant society reveals its capacity for tolerance to the degree it possesses a widely shared conception of the good and the true a society uncertain about its values -- as appears to be the case in many western countries, including canada -- will be incapable in the long run of toleration a tolerant culture, says gray, doesn't necessarily require a shared religion or even ethnic homogeneity, but it does demand widespread acceptance of particular norms and values, and, above all, a shared sense of nation """"a stable liberal civil society cannot be radically multicultural because it depends for its successful renewal across the generations on an under-girding common culture""""
gray conclusion returns me to the circumstances and the thinker with whom i began this series the controversy that erupted over the herouxville """"code of life"""" demonstrated that many quebecers -- and many other canadians, too -- are concerned about what political philosopher george grant described as """"the love of one own;"""" that is, the love of those traditions, values and practices that provide people with meaning and purpose in their lives to """"love one own"""" is not xenophobic as grant pointed out, it is through our particular roots that we first gain access to a more universal good
the same, i suggest, holds true for toleration by learning to tolerate each other we gain a more universal perspective on how much we share indeed, those who acquire the habit of tolerance often find they have much in common without having to surrender their own values the challenge we face today is avoiding the abuses of toleration -- hyper-toleration, in short -- that make sharing values or finding common ground so difficult for flawed and imperfectible citizens such as ourselves

many refugees fled their war-torn homelands with little or no identification and have not been able to secure the papers needed to become a landed immigrant, leaving them in legal limbo for years
landed status can open the door to a wider range of jobs and lower tuition fees as well as give people the right to sponsor relatives who also wish to come to canada
the immigration department recently agreed to relax the identity requirement after representatives of the somali community challenged the provision in the federal court of canada as discriminatory
two sworn declarations
under the court-sanctioned agreement, crafted through negotiations between the parties, convention refugees who lack satisfactory identification may provide two sworn declarations attesting to their identity
one must be from the refugee and the other from either a credible person who knew them before they came to canada, or from a legitimate organization that has taken steps to establish the refugee identity since his or her arrival
ahmed hashi of the getting landed project, an advocacy group for refugees, said the new provisions """"lift a significant barrier"""" to the landing of newcomers
""""now people will be able to get on with their lives and begin full integration into canadian society,"""" hashi said yesterday in a statement
the federal government had insisted strict identity provisions were needed to ensure warlords and other criminals did not slip through the screening process
advocates for refugees argued that many strife-ridden countries lack functioning central authorities to issue identity documents in other cases, refugees are unable to obtain such records from governments that persecuted them, or which might make reprisals against family members in addition, about  per cent of affected refugees were women and children
wait five years
as of , the immigration department required refugees without proper documentation to wait five years before applying for landed status in , the period was reduced to three years
however, members of the somali community argued the identification provisions discriminated against them based on nationality and race and therefore violated the charter of rights and freedoms
they cited one case in which a refugee couldn't obtain landed status even though seven siblings vouched for his identity
the agreement, reached in mid-december, """"applies to any refugee who does not have acceptable identity documents for purposes of landing,"""" said immigration spokeswoman danielle sarazin
it will remain in effect until at least june , 
hashi lauded other aspects of the agreement, which:
- require immigration officers, prior to a final decision, to advise applicants of any negative assessment and give them the opportunity to contest the assessment
- obligate the department to """"process identification documentation as expeditiously as possible in all circumstances""""",The Kingston Whig-Standard,2001-01-03,2001,1,3

Senator Chuck Schumer is proposing a 27 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods if the Chinese government doesn't adjust its currency.

The broader world and Canada's place in it have received barely a mention in this election. Instead, as the campaign goes into its final days, Harper and Martin are obsessed with television ads that are about the equivalent of two schoolkids shooting """"boogerhead"""" and """"doofus"""" at each other, but with better production values.","  harper and martin miss the point when it comes to one of the world's most repressive regimes
in any election, there are a lot of big things that don't get discussed, but none of them is bigger than canada's relationship with china
to listen to conservative stephen harper and liberal paul martin, you'd think the big canada-china issues were a fee on immigrants and an apology for a head tax on chinese that was last charged in  harper gets an extra half-mark for saying the kyoto accord doesn't mean much without imposing restrictions on a polluter such as china
the official line from the liberals is that china presents great economic opportunities for canada all we need is more education, better cities and more innovation
if only it were true canada's real relationship with china is much different in , we imported $ billion of goods from china, but sold the chinese only $ billion in our trading relationship, we play the role of third world country, exporting raw materials to china so the chinese can sell us manufactured products go into any retail store and you will see our market is flooded with chinese goods you used to be able to buy clothing, shoes, electronics and sporting goods that were made in north america good luck trying to find them now
we import more from china every year, but we are making few inroads in the chinese market what could we sell them other than raw materials? we simply can't compete with china the average annual income for a canadian was $, in  in china, it was only $, how could you fight a wage gap like that? add in an artificially low currency, a huge domestic consumer base and a solid education system, and the chinese have an economy that's in an entirely different league than ours think of the ottawa senators playing a peewee team
if we do have something the chinese want, like icewine, they unscrupulously bottle some local plonk and call it canadian icewine
canada isn't alone in getting its economy hammered by the chinese china's trade surplus with the world was $ billion last year that's according to china experts in the west say it's easily four times that much
in the united states, legislators at least realize the trade imbalance is a problem senator chuck schumer is proposing a  per cent tariff on all chinese goods if the chinese government doesn't adjust its currency china's economic success should have boosted its currency by now, increasing the price of its goods and making it easier for others to compete the government has kept the currency artificially low our leaders aren't speaking about this, even though canada's trade figures with china are quite bad
the problem in dealing with china goes well beyond the impact on our economy bluntly put, china is a polluting, repressive regime, and we're supporting that every time we buy chinese goods and yet, since the time of pierre trudeau, our political and business leaders have toured china like puppy dogs begging for scraps from the chinese economic table we're told the politicians make an obligatory mention of human rights that must mean a lot to china's jailed dissidents
in canada, paul martin is trying to alarm us with the idea that stephen harper might override the constitution to take away someone's right to something imagine, a country with rights in china, repression of anyone who doesn't agree with the regime is routine
canadian leaders talk about kyoto and offer a transit pass tax credit to get us to ride the bus meanwhile, we continue to do business with a country that pollutes the environment on a scale that we can barely comprehend in its race to rapidly expand its economy, china hasn't bothered worrying about the damage to the environment
martin keeps saying he supports kyoto, but without a country such as china included, how much value does it have? kyoto classified china as a """"developing"""" country, but it is estimated that its economy will be the fourth-largest in the world this year some development

1696138515,"Time for Canadian politicians to talk about immigration; It's vital to our economy, Elie Mikhael Nasrallah writes",[...]this new system could potentially create a two-tier citizenship streams:,"  the immigration file may not be sexy, but it is surely significant in an aging and demographically-challenged canada the issues of immigration numbers, integration, citizenship rules, family unification, refugees and reasonable accommodation are all of national importance
yet again, immigration is no-show in yet another federal election campaign season why? what is behind this culture of silence, especially given the traditional importance of the immigrant vote to the liberal party's fortunes in ontario, montreal, vancouver and particularly in the vote-rich gta? and now that the ndp is seen as a viable agent for change, it should tell canadians of its plans on immigration
prime minister stephen harper's regime has made drastic, fundamental, even revolutionary changes to the immigration and refugee system
first, the economic stream the conservative government changed the skilled immigrants program by imposing a new management system called """"express entry"""" to manage applications for permanent residents under the following federal economic programs:
the federal skilled worker program
the federal skilled trades program
the canadian experience class potential candidates complete an online express entry profile emphasizing their skills, work experience, language ability, education and adaptability and spouse's input the new system has fundamental weaknesses, such as lack of transparency, accountability and any control by the applicant over the process decisions are taken in the dark with little knowledge of the selection process and by invisible decision-makers
second, the drastic changes to the citizenship regime immigration minister chris alexander introduced the strengthening canadian citizenship act in bill c- this year lorne waldman, one of canada's foremost immigration and citizenship lawyers, wrote a scathing analysis of the new law, saying: """"under the proposed changes (they are now the law of the land), a person will only be eligible for citizenship if they satisfy the minister that they intend to reside in canada after they obtain citizenship this only applies to naturalized citizens  that's not a way to foster a citizenship of commitment that's a way to foster a citizenship of fear""""
in fact, this new system could potentially create a two-tier citizenship streams: the bornin-canada citizen vs the naturalized citizen, making them unequal before the law
furthermore, the government is granting under this new law extensive discretionary powers to immigration officers unprecedented in canadian immigration history they could refuse citizenship based on their subjective understanding of an applicant's intent to reside in canada add to that the requirement to be in canada at least  days in each calendar year for four out of six years this act may well be tested and challenged in the supreme court under section  of the charter (equality rights) opposition politicians should take notice
third, family unification and sponsorships the present government has reduced the sponsorship of parents and grandparents virtually to a minimum the program was opened in  for a cap of , applications and was filled within a month or so the program is dying and only the funeral arrangements are missing that should be an election issue
immigration is becoming slowly but surely the lifeblood of the canadian economy, so the liberals and the new democrats cannot afford to lose their focus on this issue
multiculturalism is still respected and revered in canada, given the upheaval around the globe, and it is key to a prosperous economy robert d putnam, a prominent political scientist in the us, once remarked that, """"the most certain prediction that we can make about almost any modern society is that it will be more diverse a generation from now than it is today""""

Requirements of its designation as a Minor Basilica include that all liturgical and sacramental rites are to be celebrated with the fervent participation of the faithful.; Photo: Wayne Cuddington, The Ottawa Citizen / St. Patrick coat of arms.","  st patrick basilica is much more than just a beautiful building, as its current rector points out it a parish with roots as deep as its city, he tells hilary mclaughlin
in the early th century, in the rough lumber camp that was booming along the ottawa river, it used to be said there was no god in bytown
but, in fact, god had arrived about two centuries earlier, when samuel de champlain brought four missionaries with him to upper and lower canada in 
a lot of history would flow over the chaudiere falls before an actual church would rise in the area, but the seeds of ottawa were largely planted by french catholics two centuries later, as labour was needed and famine drove a nation to look for greener pastures, they would be joined by the irish
as st patrick celebrates its th anniversary as a parish, echoes of those days still resonate the current rector is monsignor robert martineau, whose name suggests one ancestry, but whose face carries the map of ireland (his mother was a ryan)
""""it not the building we are celebrating,"""" he reminds """"it the actual parish -- the people the building came long after the parish was formed""""
the first mass in the seminal parish was held in the upper floor of a molson brewery, located in the s in a building behind where the supreme court now stands in , a committee prepared to campaign for the building of a church the project faced a variety of obstacles, chiefly financial for some time, mass and services were conducted in a residence on sparks street
things got a boost in  when pope pius ix elevated bytown to the status of a diocese, and consecrated father joseph gigues as its first bishop he purchased, for $, a small methodist chapel on sparks street it was renovated and consecrated in  as st andrew church
the first pastor of the new parish, appointed in , was a scot, the scholarly, literary, highly educated and grandly named father aeneas mcdonnell dawson he was a real find for a new canadian church; he wrote the first book ever published in the city he became a great friend of thomas d'arcy mcgee, and preached the eulogy at his funeral after mcgee assassination he was also friendly with sir john a macdonald, who would, in , lay the cornerstone of the building that is today st patrick
initially, st patrick was the mother church for english catholics in the area as the population spread out and building continued, other churches were built but it still retains the pre- eminence with which it began
the makeup of the congregation prompted the name change to st patrick, under the leadership of father john collins he secured the land upon which the basilica now stands, and building commenced in  the architects were augustus laver and frederick warburton, who had built the east and west blocks of the parliament buildings they began construction of the church now standing in , in the gothic revival style
the first mass was celebrated, with the formal blessing and re- naming, on march ,  three days later, the parish had the first celebration of their patron saint in the new church
while many changes have been made to the building and its decorations over the years, it is very similar to what sir john would have passed on his way to the hill, or where sir wilfrid laurier attended masses said by pastor matthew whelan
and a church is not, however beautiful, just a building it is a community st patrick is located near the heart of political and commercial ottawa, but in its early days the area was also hugely residential at one point its borders contained six schools there was a home for orphans and seniors; in time the orphanage closed but st patrick home for the elderly stood for years on the site of what is now centennial towers
as the population moved to the suburbs and commercial buildings rose in their place, the schools closed and the home was moved to mooney bay a church hall at one time had bowling alleys in the basement, an auditorium with a stage (longtime home to the tara players), and rooms for many parish meetings and social functions however when it required prohibitively expensive renovations, it was torn down
its space now forms the much-needed parking lot adjacent the gloucester street side of the church """"don't forget,"""" says msgr martineau, """"people come to this parish from all over the city --  per cent of those who attend are from outside the area we are not simply a local church """"
andy doyle, chairman of the anniversary committee, says the associations of people with st patrick tend to be lifelong """"people move, but they come back here for all their special occasions there is a sense of coming home at st patrick""""
mr doyle grew up on cooper street """"my mother was baptized in the church  years ago her great-granddaughter was baptized there two years ago people come back to get married or for their funerals""""
the application to become a minor basilica, of which there are only  in canada, was driven by msgr martineau predecessor, msgr david corkery, with support from the archbishop marcel gervais of ottawa, and it was granted in 
requirements for this designation include that all liturgical and sacramental rites are to be conducted with exemplary presentation and celebrated with the fervent participation of the faithful
more than any church in ottawa, st patrick meets these stipulations it holds four masses every weekday and sunday, and three on saturday confessions are offered before most of them """"we sometimes do  a week,"""" says msgr martineau with a twinkle, """"and at the : weekday masses, we sometimes have all four confessionals going""""
the parish demographic has changed immensely although irish names are still prominent in many of the organizations that keep the church vibrant, a large percentage of the immigrant community resides or works in the centre of the city and they constitute an increasing part of the congregation """"our defining mission,"""" says msgr martineau, """"is to provide people with an opportunity to get the sacraments priests are always available""""
that availability is aided in part by the rectory having the space to accommodate foreign priests undertaking graduate studies at st paul and other area learning institutions places, with free room and board and a small stipend, are offered to four priests from places such as africa and the philippines; in return, they share the heavy roster of masses, confessions and some pastoral duties
additionally, priests from other parishes pitch in """"this way, we've been able to keep it open,"""" says mr doyle """"so many churches are locked most of the time there something nice about being able to get into a church, and this one is a place for prayerful devotion, with people there at all hours of the day""""
mr doyle has known the parish all his life recent convert john kersley, who was received into the church this spring at st patrick, has easily reached the same conclusion he and his wife were initially drawn to st patrick by the music well-travelled and exposed to some of the great churches of europe, he still finds in the beauty of st patrick """"a church that feels like a real church""""
he knows that what he finds there is based upon more than the building, but, he declares, """"i feel so good in that church""""
the basilica is celebrating its anniversary with many special events throughout the year, from barbecues on the lawn all summer to their forthcoming first golf tournament a grand banquet will take place in late november, and a new history book is being prepared by a team led by freelance historian fred mcevoy
in honour of their sesquicentennial, government house has just granted st patrick a charter of arms
no god in bytown? tell it to the , to , faithful who attend st patrick every week

for several decades, ottawa has been canada's nexus for shawarma, which i shouldn't have to tell you is a pita bread sandwich packed with shavings of well-seasoned chicken or beef that was cooked on a vertical spit and garnished with your choice of lettuce, hummus, tomatoes, onions, pickles, pickled turnips and sauces
ottawa's shawarma supremacy derives at least in part from the arrival of lebanese immigrants that began in , just as lebanon entered into a prolonged civil war
however, osama abu daqqa says ottawa's shawarma sellers have basically bastardized a beloved middle eastern staple
""""it's not authentic it's like they americanized the shawarma based on the market or demand,"""" says abu daqqa, who opened laheeb shawarma, his very casual somerset street west eatery, in early july
""""we decided to be unique, authentic, exactly like back home,"""" abu daqqa says
(to be fair, some of his shawarma predecessors told this newspaper in  the canadian version of shawarma rarely resembled the original, and that one distinction was that, back home, french fries were among the ingredients)
saj beef shawarma meal from laheeb flaming hot restaurant
where did abu daqqa call home before he came to ottawa three years ago? he and his two fellow laheeb co-owners are palestinians, and he says he has  years of experience running similar restaurants in saudi arabia the murals inside laheeb shawarma, which otherwise is spartanly decorated, refer to """"shawarma arabica, laheeb style, not sold anywhere"""" laheeb's chef, abu daqqa says, is syrian
i tried laheeb's shawarma this past week and its hype man is right it is different from ottawa's usual shawarma suspects and also very good
first, while you can order laheeb's sandwiches on pita bread, they're better on saj bread, the fresher, thinner, softer, chewier unleavened flatbread quickly baked on a convex metal griddle called (what else but) a saj regulars at the lansdowne and westboro farmers' markets will know and probably love the falafel sandwiches made with fresh saj bread by the syrian cooks who call themselves the falafel guys
the contents of those saj breads also set laheeb's shawarmas apart beef shawarmas here are in fact made with a mix of beef and lamb, and they come garnished with tomato, onion and parsley rather than the buyer's choice laheeb's chicken, both light and dark meat, comes with garlic sauce, pickles """"and nothing else,"""" abu daqqa says
both sandwiches, ordered large and cut into manageable slabs, were juicy and well-seasoned and served with their pickled accompaniments and some raw veg on the side
laheeb shawarma also serves broasted chicken, the pressure-fried variant of fried chicken popular in the middle east mildly seasoned pieces of bone-in chicken and spicier, well-battered strips of chicken breast were tasty at home, but would have been better (that is, crisper and juicier) had we dined in taken home, laheeb's chunky fries also suffered - steaming in a container does that to fried food
spying knafeh on a laheeb's murals, i had to order the hot arabic dessert, which wraps desalinated cheese in shredded filo pastry or semolina dough and adds syrup and chopped pistachios it, too, was a dish best eaten without delay after its trip home, it had lost its gooeyness also, its exterior seemed a little overcooked
laheeb also has machine for making ayran, a cold and salty yogurt beverage my fresh-from-the-machine sample was much better than the few sips of bottled ayran i've had
the laheeb on chinatown's outskirts, which replaced the unique vietnamese pho eatery lobster noodle house, is abu daqqa's second laheeb in town
beef and chicken shawarma at laheeb shawarma on somerset street west
in late , he and his partners opened laheeb grill on montreal road that tiny eatery is notable because its specialty is kebabs cooked over charcoal that intensely flavours the morsels of cubed or ground beef and chicken
i've twice sampled the kebabs offered in the family meal along with a flattened half-chicken they easily won over me and my fellow char-lovers once again, they were better when eaten onsite, fast-food ambience notwithstanding
the east-end laheeb also grills lamb chops, which were fine and cheaper than you would find elsewhere, but not special enough to outdo the kebabs all meats at both laheebs are halal, killed and prepared according to muslim strictures
laheeb offers veggie kebabs made with bulgur, which i didn't see on the menu until i wrote this column sorry i'm too easily fixated on middle eastern char-grilled meats
my shortlist for smoky charred kebabs in ottawa includes pita bell in the west end, which also offers turkish dishes, and the lebanese restaurant les grillades on colonnade road these more established eateries, which are better set up for dining in than the laheebs, are my go-to's for char-grilled kebabs in ottawa but i'm glad laheeb grill is a worthy east-end alternative
so, in less than two years and during a pandemic, abu daqqa and his partners have opened two laheebs, which means flames in arabic, that are lifting the bar for middle eastern fast food in a city with a glut of it
""""we're not going to open a store to fail,"""" abu daqqa says if anything, his success means your satisfaction

it was economics rather than an artist's curiosity about people that saw ms hotte take to cab driving to pay her tuition to study for a master of arts degree in visual arts at windsor university

her passion for human folklore in art never died and in  she returned as a mature student to northern college in south porcupine, ont, where she received her first diploma of arts and crafts with photography and weaving majors supporting herself by a variety of unrelated jobs, she went on to achieve a bachelor of fine arts degree at queen's university where she completed her bachelor of education this year

as a housewife watching the seemingly endless snowflakes from her window in the lonely north, ms hotte """"began to feel a need to express my feelings, which i began doing through the medium of oil painting""""
the bleak canadian landscape and its people left an indelible imprint on the artist's heart """"the feelings i have been expressing are concerned with the peaceful, quiet, open spaces as they appear to me in all seasons and all weather,"""" she said """"i was then and am still concerned with the people of the north, our natural resources and their possible loss through bad management and pollution""""

Please email bird observations and/or photographs to: bruce.dilabio@sympatico.ca using the subject line Ottawa Citizen Birds.","  spring's roller-coaster weather ride continues with cool temperatures this past week and the long-range forecast doesn't look much better the cooler weather has significantly slowed the northbound movement of migrant birds to eastern ontario and, as a result, birds are still just trickling into the region on a positive note, the lack of vegetation makes it easier to see the birds that have arrived wait until all the leaves are out and you're searching for those warblers high in the canopy even at point pelee national park in southern ontario, the migration has been slow hopefully there is warm weather on the horizon and lots of great birding to follow
even though it's been a slow migration, we've had a couple of rarities discovered, including a male hooded warbler in the ottawa area and a male painted bunting at a feeder in the huntsville area
the hooded warbler discovered by stephen phillips on april  caused lots of excitement in the ottawa-gatineau birding community it played hide and seek along the jock river at the terry carrise park with the cool temperatures, the warbler fed close to the ground, searching for insects fortunately there was lots of food and the bird was still present on april  this is one of the few records of this southern warbler for the ottawa-gatineau district and the earliest occurrence the previous earliest record was on may , , at clyde avenue woods in ottawa where jim harris discovered a singing male
the male painted bunting was discovered on april  going to a feeder in the huntsville area this species is extremely rare in canada its normal range is in the southeastern united states the male is unmistakable while the female has bright-green upper parts and is a paler yellow-green below there is one record for the ottawa-gatineau district on may , , a male was photographed at a bird feeder and was present for two days keep a watch out at your feeders and if you see an unfamiliar species, try to photograph it anything is possible at this time of year, and with inclement weather birds can be blown off course
still no local reports of rubythroated hummingbird or baltimore orioles but you should be considering putting up your hummingbird or oriole feeders within the next couple of weeks both species enjoy feeding on a diluted sugar-water solution the first ruby-throated hummingbirds and baltimore orioles have been sighted in southern ontario and hopefully a few will be reported soon in our area remember to keep your birdfeeders full too there are now purple finch migrating and whitecrowned sparrows have been reported the first rose-breasted grosbeak of the spring was observed april  in richmond by peter blancher more should be in our region shortly and they do visit feeders i received a number of reports of brown thrasher and eastern towhee this past week from various areas including carp ridge and the dunrobin area the eastern towhee, formerly called rufous-sided towhee is a scarce breeder in the ottawa-gatineau district
even though we are in the middle of spring migration, there are a number of species of land birds nest-building and laying eggs this includes the eastern phoebe, american crow, black-capped chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, american robin, european starling, common grackle and northern cardinal
if you're looking for a good spot to view spring migrants, the britannia conservation area/mud lake is one of the best in the city during may, more than  species of warblers can pass through along with vireos, thrushes, flycatchers and sparrows
also consider trips to the kingston area, chaffeys lock and algonquin provincial park another  species of warbler can be found at these locations if you can't make it to point pelee for spring migration, there are a few closer locations including presqu'ile provincial park and prince edward point, both on lake ontario and worth the visit so it's time to study your field guide and review your warbler songs
new arrivals in the ottawa area this past week included virginia rail, common gallinule, broadwinged hawk, great crested flycatcher, house wren, cliff swallow, and field sparrow from this week on, there will be many new species each week as more than  species can be found during may in eastern ontario

clearly, the people who undertook this perilous journey are not responding to incentives and disincentives in the neat and tidy way abbott expects tough love for migrants has not stopped smugglers from taking people out to sea instead, the smugglers identified the obvious loophole that policy-makers did not they have learned to simply make false promises, pocket the money, then abandon the migrants at sea
canada's government has adopted a similar ideology to abbott's when it comes to refugees arriving by boat it contends that if destination countries turn away boats and punish smugglers, the exploitation of desperate people will stop the situation in the bay of bengal - and in the mediterranean - suggests that theory is a dangerously simplistic approach to a complex problem desperate people will do desperate things, whether countries provide safe access to their shores for migrants or not
canada should do its part for abandoned migrants, should increase pressure on burma to respect the human rights of the country's minorities and should increase its global resettlement programs this year, canada has agreed to accept up to , resettled refugees, total there are almost a million refugees worldwide who have no prospects of return to their homes, no ability to start a new life where they are and for whom resettlement to a third country is the only option the vast majority don't make it into official resettlement programs for many rohingya, the officially approved choices are to stay where they are and be attacked or go to a permanent refugee camp to languish until they die what would we have them do? the response that all they need is a little tough love, so that they will stop risking their lives for their freedom, is disgusting

hughes recently returned from india, where she attended a world association of girl guides and girl scouts conference trainers from countries such as singapore, kenya and new zealand came together to exchange ideas and expand their training techniques
the willowdale resident was one of two canadians chosen to participate in the -day conference
``i wanted to go because it was in the asia pacific and there are so many immigrants from there coming into toronto i felt guiding should understand the culture they're coming from, the cultural differences,'' says hughes, who also volunteers as a leader of sparks, the age group below brownies
``we have girl guides and brownies all over ontario of all ages, but my job is the training of the leaders for those girls,'' says hughes ``there are , leaders in ontario and you can only provide as good a program for the girls as those leaders are trained to provide''
the mandate of girl guides of canada - which is entirely funded by those yearly cookie sales - is to help girls and young women become responsible citizens, able to give leadership and service to the community
``you'll find kids out cleaning out rivers and waterways or visiting seniors' homes, taking things to shut-ins,'' says hughes ``if you can train people in their developing years, they will continue to give service to their community as an adult''
hughes says the conference was ``quite a challenge'' trainers communicated in english but for many, it was their second or third language and the group didn't use translators
``i learned a great deal about the diversity of the countries that were there and how they had to adapt the same sort of program to their country,'' says hughes but she adds, ``when we got down to the bottom line, we all had the same purpose and reason''

1513823972,Top contenders set sights on leadership:   Trio of Parti Quebecois wise men targeting top job before dust has settled on leader's crushing defeat,"Even though the details of the next PQ leadership contest have not yet been announced by the party, it was clear late Monday night that even as the last of the election ballots were being counted, confirming that the PQ had recorded its worst result since the 1970 election, six years before the party took power for the first time, the race has begun.","  it was an uncomfortable scene to watch - the three presumed wise men of the sovereigntist parti quebecois giving what amounted to leadership pitches before pauline marois had even announced her resignation
a business titan (pierre karl peladeau), a demagogic former journalist (bernard drainville) and a backroom political strategist (jean-francois lisee) were there to warm up the crowd of supporters for their defeated leader but they seemed to already have an eye on the soon-to-be-vacant post leading the party
the pq, more than most any other movement, is a party that devours its losing leaders and carries on, waiting, scheming and dreaming of the next chance to make quebec an independent country
even though the details of the next pq leadership contest have not yet been announced by the party, it was clear late monday night that even as the last of the election ballots were being counted, confirming that the pq had recorded its worst result since the  election, six years before the party took power for the first time, the race has begun
""""the parti quebecois that rene levesque created made it through the years of (liberal premier robert) bourassa and took back power,"""" said lisee, an outgoing pq minister and university professor who served as the pq's  referendum strategist
""""(the party) made it through the (jean) charest years and took back power and it will survive through the (philippe) couillard years and take back power""""
it was a twist of electoral fate that at that very moment broadcaster radio-canada cut away from the scene to make the official announcement that marois had been defeated by the liberal candidate in her charlevoix riding north of quebec city - the ultimate disgrace for a tarnished party
""""we are right to be disappointed but i have to tell you one thing: we'll never give up, never, never,"""" said drainville, who has had long-held and poorly disguised designs on the pq leadership since shortly after he quit journalism just days before the  provincial election
""""in our history we have gone through trials so much worse than an election defeat and we have always come back and we will come back from this defeat""""
despite the tough talk there are dark days ahead as the pq tries to take away some guiding message from monday's crushing loss one came from the former leader of the federal bloc quebecois, gilles duceppe, who presided over the  election massacre that reduced the bq to just five mps
""""it would be a grave error to try and chose a saviour without posing important questions about the objectives of the party without defining a clear strategy and without asking if a changing of the guard shouldn't occur considering that the pq lost much of its attraction among the youth,"""" he wrote on his journal de montreal blog
it would seem that the popular-but-controversial stab at wedge politics - using a proposed public-service ban on religious clothing to separate quebecers into a francophone """"us"""" versus an immigrant """"them"""" - was not enough to prop up a stumbling and disjointed pq campaign but the party might have had a different outcome if only they had introduced their so-called values charter legislation two months ago rather than letting it drag through the legislature since last september
the next leadership race will have to think hard about where the pq fits on quebec's more cluttered political spectrum that appears to be less defined by the historical rumbles between federalists and sovereigntists
for the pq in particular, the next leader will have to set out a long-term strategy to compete on its right flank with the fiscally conservative coalition avenir quebec for disinterested or disavowed sovereigntists and nationalists at the same time the pq must fend off the encroachment on its left flank of the socialist and sovereigntist quebec solidaire

1817485713,Culture war splitting Tories,"Since their drubbing last Oct. 19, Conservatives in Canada have been like deer in the headlights. Last week it was reported that a Leitch campaign survey had posed this question: """"Should the Canadian government screen potential immigrants for anti-Canadian values as part of its normal screening for refugees and landed immigrants?"""" A furor ensued.","  you have to give kellie leitch, previously a long shot and now an insurgent long shot to lead the conservative party of canada, this much: she's got brass
since their drubbing last oct , conservatives in canada have been like deer in the headlights a succession of party stalwarts, jason kenney chief among them, have backed away from the race to succeed stephen harper they've suddenly discovered much more important business to occupy their time kenney was last seen piloting a pickup along the back roads of alberta in his new quest to become premier of his home province peter mackay, who left politics in the spring of  while leaving the door open to a return, appears paralyzed by indecision lisa raitt has been testing the waters - and testing, and testing james moore is out for family reasons john baird is happy in the private sector michelle rempel isn't interested and on it goes
but leitch is good to go, as are tony clement, maxime bernier and michael chong - none of them among the top tier in harper's firmament, save clement to a point it is as though - perish the thought - those with the best chance of defeating prime minister justin trudeau in  have decided they can't, and are content to let another take the fall
even among those now declared, leitch was a controversial candidate, not least because she - with chris alexander, the former diplomat and immigration minister who lost his seat last year - had been a poster child for the """"barbaric practices tip line"""" miscue that sent last year's conservative campaign into the ditch
the tip line, a transparent bid to stoke a fight with the liberals and new democrats over the """"reasonable accommodation"""" of immigrants, undid in a day much of the good work done by the party to welcome new canadians in april on cbc's power politics, leitch teared up while professing regret that put the matter to rest, seemingly
but apparently, as far as team leitch is concerned, a new wind is blowing - a nativist wind, ripe for the harvest last week it was reported that a leitch campaign survey had posed this question: """"should the canadian government screen potential immigrants for anti-canadian values as part of its normal screening for refugees and landed immigrants?"""" a furor ensued leitch upped the ante
""""canadians can expect to hear more, not less from me, on this topic in the coming months,"""" she said friday
sunday, speaking on ctv's question period, interim conservative leader rona ambrose disavowed the idea of an """"anti-canadian values"""" screen monday bernier did the same ergo, there are now two conservative parties - one hostile to immigration, one not the leadership race now shapes up as a battle between these poles the likely beneficiaries? the liberals, naturally
and there's more than electoral math at stake at issue is the conservative party's history of embracing immigration under harper and his red tory predecessor, brian mulroney canada routinely takes in about , immigrants a year that influx accounts for two thirds of the country's population growth, according to statistics canada, which in turn fuels economic growth, such as it is this trend is expected to accelerate as the baby boom generation ages harper himself, in an interview with the wall street journal in , attributed his majority in  to its success in courting new canadians
why did leitch decide to go all-in? one objective seems plain: donations last month it emerged she's taken an early but significant lead in fundraising, accounting for about  per cent of the $, raised by three thendeclared leadership aspirants (leitch, chong, bernier) in the second quarter, the canadian press reported the conservative base is loyal, fiercely partisan and famously driven to donate by hot-button issues what alienates swing voters in a general election, in other words, may have the opposite effect on populist social conservatives primed for a culture war by months of saturation coverage of donald trump and the brexit
the take-away is this: leitch doesn't care about upending the pluralist tradition of her party, or about how her latest gambit will surely be used by the liberals to paint all tories as xenophobes nor does she care about the evident risks in broaching a culture war, witness the career-ending losses of harper last year and quebec premier pauline marois in  leitch cares, it seems, about filling her campaign coffers
it may pay off for her, fundraising-wise - while kneecapping the party for the bigger battle to come given current support for the liberals at  per cent, according to poll aggregator threehundredeight com, it's hard to discern the looming nativist revolution in canada, just yet but perhaps we can now begin to speculate feverishly about a centrist pivot for future tory leader leitch, as was once posited for trump, sometime in ?
well, sure sure we can

call it the user-pay principle, fees-for-service or plain old cost cutting estimates in the budget indicate individuals and businesses could eventually pay close to $ million a year for public services once provided free
consumers in general may be hit with higher prices as government subsidies to business decline measures announced in the recent budget, for instance, could increase the cost of cheese, butter and, in some cases, electricity
many users of government services are already paying the price of smaller government others are about to begin
``this may just be the first wave of user fees,'' says carleton university tax expert allan maslove
``there may be a second wave once the provinces figure out how to adjust to the money they are losing then they may start thinking about higher user fees for provincial services''
the user-pay principle requires taxpayers to pay extra if they receive any special benefit from government services the list to date includes new immigrants, private pilots, anglers, boaters, airplane passengers and people seeking detailed weather information
``this is fair when you have a service that benefits a small percentage of the population,'' says maslove ``especially when that small percentage of the population is better off than the average''
in local terms, the new enthusiasm for cost-recovery meant an increase in airport parking fees last fall
beginning next month, visitors will pay to enter the laurier house museum
sailors will eventually be charged more for the use of the dozens of recreational harbors in the area
and boaters on the rideau canal will pay higher fees to go through the locks landlubbers who picnic, fish and boat-watch at the locks may also be charged for the pleasure following a heritage canada decision expected later this month
``we are looking at fees for land-based visitors,'' says dave ballinger, the director of canal operations with heritage canada ``boaters have told us that since they are paying toward the cost of the canal that visitors who arrive by road should also be paying''
the people who fish at the black rapids lock station off hwy  (near fallowfield road) and picnickers at the long island locks near manotick are just some of those who could be affected by a decision to introduce new user fees
the trickle-down effects of the budget and the massive rethinking of federal programs also mean:
l the price of dairy products such as cheese and butter could go up as the federal subsidy paid to industrial milk producers goes down
the farm subsidy will decline by  per cent over the next two years -- to $ million from $ million
``i will be very surpised if the industry absorbs the cuts,'' says honey forbes, an alberta lawyer who represents the consumers association of canada before the canadian dairy commission the commission, which regulates the price of dairy products, allowed a one-per-cent increase in the cost of butter, cheese and other dairy products in  after a -per-cent cut in the subsidy
* canadians who want to talk to a real, live weather forecaster will have to dial a - number and pay $ for the first three minutes of detailed, educated opinion environment canada expects the service will be used by everyone from drivers worried about winter storms to ski resort operators canadians who just want the basic weather can still phone free of charge for the pre-recorded environment canada forecast
* boaters using the  recreational harbors across the country will pay more to berth their vessels within the next five years the fisheries department will turn over all the harbors -- and their $ million in operating costs -- to local authorities or private operators in the meantime, fees are expected in some cases to double to boost the $ million in revenue now generated by the harbors
federal harbors in this area include the dick bell marina in nepean andrew haydon park as well as facilities in dunrobin, rockland, constance bay, aylmer and gatineau
* canadians travelling outside north america will see the air transportation tax added on top of a ticket price increase beginning may  travellers to the united states will also pay a slightly higher tax depending on the ticket price
the higher fees are expected to generate an additional $ million in revenue, bringing total earnings from the tax to $ million in -
* transport canada proposes to collect an additional $ million in landing and terminal fees from airlines in - this could also lead to a small increase in ticket prices if the airlines pass the costs on to travellers
* private plane, glider and balloon pilots will have to pay a new $-a-year fee to validate their licences transport canada proposes to introduce the new fee in the summer and raise about $ million in the first year
* about , salmon anglers fishing off the british columbia coast could see their permits triple to $ a year beginning in  the fisheries department also proposes to introduce a permit for recreational anglers on the east coast it will cost less than $ and apply to people after mackerel and, where permitted, cod the fees will earn the federal government about $ million in the first year, up from $ million right now
* reductions in the postal subsidy for magazines will likely increase the cost of subscriptions for about  different canadian publications the subsidy, worth $ million this year, will decline to about $ million by -
``the government calls this a spending cut, but really it is just passing on the cost to the consumers because there is no way the magazines with their low profit margins can absorb this,'' says catherine keachie, president of the canadian magazine publishers association
* the cost of canadian books will likely increase, while their variety decreases, because of cuts in federal subsidies to the publishing industry federal assistance to publishers for the publication of canadian books will fall to $ million next year from $ million in -
``this is a subsidy to book publishers but it is also a subsidy to consumers because it helps keep down the price of candian books,'' says roy macskimming of the association of canadian publishers
the small canadian market means the price of canadian books is already higher than mass-produced american publications
* heritage canada later this month will announce a new fee schedule for the  national parks and more than  historical sites it administers the goal is to double parks canada revenues to $ million over the next five years
new fees will be introduced: for instance, it will soon cost adults $ to get into laurier house in ottawa and existing fees will be increased, including the cost of entry, parking and camping in national parks
* the end of a federal tax rebate means customers of investor-owned utilities will see their power costs increase
the rebate offset discrimination between public utilities that don't pay federal income tax and the investor-owned utilities scrapping the public utilities income tax transfer act will save the federal treasury $ million in - and $ million the year after
but the utilities, located mostly in alberta, estimate the average electricity cost for a residential customer will increase by seven per cent, or $ a year natural gas costs for a residential customer are expected to increase by three per cent or $ a year
* immigrants to canada and refugees claiming asylum will have to pay $ each, a controversial move that will raise about $ million in new revenue
the government also announced in the budget that the process of becoming a canadian will now cost a landed immigrant $ in fees, compared to $ in the past the higher fees are expected to generate an additional $ million a year

stewart jeans of ottawa told the story of a pigeon that crashed into glass door and fell on the ground with a sharp-shinned hawk attacking it after a few minutes, the hawk flew off with its prey sharp-shins are more likely to go after mourning doves, which are lighter than the pigeons
the hawk spotted by lauren macies was a cooper's hawk, with the rounded end to the long barred tail that has a well-defined white edge to it it was seen at mud lake in britannia don caldwell watched a bald eagle soaring seeming without concern over the ottawa river although it was being pursued by some obviously upset crows
the raucous harassment of crows is part of life for eagles and owls and other raptors it must be very trying, though, especially if you are trying to sleep like the owls do in the daytime

Black & White Photo; Canadian Press photo; BRIAN MULRONEY with appointees, from left, John McDermid, [Gerry Weiner], [Gerald Merrithew]; GERALD MERRITHEW","ottawa (cp) - with an eye apparently to the public opinion polls and a general election, prime minister brian mulroney shuffled his cabinet thursday, moving around five ministers and adding two new faces
mulroney promised to create two new government departments - forestry and multiculturalism - and appointed a full-time minister of housing to reflect what he called the """"needs and realities of canada""""
deputy prime minister don mazankowski, mulroney's house leader and day-to-day operator of government, takes on yet another job - the agriculture post left vacant with john wise's announcement thursday that he is leaving politics
the new-look, election-war cabinet features fresh ministers from southern ontario and a promotion for a british columbian - both tory weak spots, according to recent opinion polls
gerry st germain, an affable mp from british columbia, takes over forestry from his old post as junior transport minister, while gerry weiner gets a promotion to run the new department of multiculturalism and citizenship weiner had been minister of state for multiculturalism
ministers of state are paid the same and enjoy most of the same perks as ministers in charge of full departments, but their responsibilities aren't as large state ministries usually operate out of the facilities of the parent department and have only small staffs
newcomers include shirley martin, appointed junior transport minister, and john mcdermid, who becomes junior trade minister and gets the new post of minister of state for housing both come from southern ontario
martin is the caucus vice-chairman, while mcdermid had been a fiercely partisan parliamentary secretary to trade minister john crosbie he has stridently defended the free trade pact with the united states in the commons and in commons committees
moved to new portfolios within the cabinet were: monique vezina, the junior employment and immigration minister, who retains her job and becomes minister of state for seniors; and gerald merrithew, who had been minister of state for forestry and mines and now takes the reins at veterans affairs
liberal leader john turner, visiting montreal, said the creation of two new departments was a cynical gesture by the prime minister he predicted the new ministers won't have much time to enjoy the perks of office
""""i hope that the new ministers are not going to be over-exercised about their new cars and their chauffeurs, they're not going to last long,"""" turner told reporters
ndp leader ed broadbent called the shuffle """"cynical electioneering,"""" while ndp mp lorne nystrom said it was a """"desperate attempt"""" by the tories to save their political hides he said farmers have been cheated with mazankowski's appointment as a """"part-time minister""""
merrithew, a new brunswicker, was also named minister responsible for the atlantic canada opportunities agency, a post that had been held by lowell murray, the government's leader in the senate
george hees, the veterans affairs minister leaving politics after  years in office, has been appointed mulroney's personal adviser and ambassador-at-large he'll have a key role in telling mulroney what to do about canadian food aid to developing countries
still vigorous at , one of the most popular mps, hees earlier said he wanted exactly such a job
wise said he'd grown tired of politics after more than two decades in office he won't say what he'll do next
in acquiring agriculture, albertan mp mazankowski alters the traditional split among farm-related jobs of one minister from the east and one from the west both he and grain minister charles mayer are from the west
both wise and hees were praised by the prime minister, who wouldn't take reporters' bait on whether the shuffle is an election harbinger
""""these days, if i change my shirt, it's perceived as an election gesture,"""" he said outside rideau hall, the governor-general's residence where ministers were brought into cabinet
mulroney said the multiculturalism and forestry departments won't be formed until parliament has passed enabling legislation
the departure of wise and hees and the addition of martin, the mp for the ontario riding of lincoln who rolled up to the swearing-in ceremony in a shiny red mazda, and mcdermid, mp for the west-of-toronto riding of brampton-georgetown, leaves cabinet at  members including mulroney
the cabinet includes six women,  men;  from the west,  from quebec,  from ontario and seven from the atlantic region

but if the us continues to ratchet up security -- and the federal government sits idly by -- the idea of the """"friendly, undefended"""" border that we have always taken for granted will simply disappear
this past week, for example, the us started photographing and fingerprinting foreign visitors who arrive at airports later this year, the program will be extended to land borders while canadians are exempt, the us is warning that we are likely to face increased demands for documentation very soon
also, a special border security team was established to provide another layer of inspection for us-bound trucks and trains specifically, the team will check for explosives, illegal aliens, drugs and other terrorist-related cargo
friday, tom ridge, the us homeland security secretary, toured the st clair river by helicopter and called the narrow waterway a """"pathway for terrorists"""" ridge said the us border patrol has now tripled in size to more than , agents along the canadian border, but even more resources might be needed
by now, it should be clear to prime minister paul martin that the current border crackdown isn't going to let up until the americans are convinced that the risk of terrorists entering their country through canada is eliminated

but before the us would consider implementing a security perimeter for the continent, canada must take a tougher stance on immigration and refugee issues
the european union's common security border provides one model for canada and the us to follow under the eu plan, people entering the mainland security zone undergo common screening and are then allowed to travel freely between eu countries truck drivers, for example, can travel from one eu country to another without having to go through a single customs inspection time is saved and efficiency increases
two themes usually dominate criticism of a continental security perimeter -- integrating our immigration and refugee policies with the us would erode our multicultural values and harmonizing our laws with the us would mean giving up sovereignty
first, common immigration and refugee policies that would keep terrorists out of the us and canada -- before they get off boats or planes -- would make us all safer decent, hard-working immigrants have always been needed and welcomed here and in the us and they still would be
second, sovereignty is a measure of our ability to govern ourselves and make laws, something that wouldn't be eroded to any measurable degree by increasing our common security

1709592936,"Why Syria's refugees are Canada's business; We are meddling there, and we have always welcomed those in need, writes Chris Kilford","Life in a refugee camp in Afghanistan, Jordan or elsewhere is not pleasant.","  my family and i arrived in canada from the united kingdom in  seeking a better future and last year, after almost  years in uniform, i retired from the canadian armed forces
when my wife and i moved from ankara, turkey, to victoria we purchased an older condominium and soon began much needed renovations and, as it turned out, our electrician happened to be one of the , vietnamese refugees or """"boat people"""" that canada took in between  and  for both of us, immigrant and refugee, canada was and still is a land of opportunity
when you are overseas, especially in conflict zones, one understands quickly why countries such as ours are beacons of light for millions of people, including refugees life in a refugee camp in afghanistan, jordan or elsewhere is not pleasant even in the well-run turkish refugee camps, hope eventually fades and that's why ordinary people are willing to take extraordinary risks and why the lifeless body of alan kurdi came to wash ashore on a beach
as for me, i have little empathy for the european union, which now finds itself under semi-siege with some , refugees and migrants having crossed the mediterranean so far this year four years ago, and using un security council resolution  as a cover, many of these european countries as well as canada, toppled the libyan government when the syrian uprising began in early , the british, french and canadian governments, among others, also moved quickly to isolate and weaken the assad regime but there was little consideration as to what this could mean for the syrian people well, now we know by the end of , syria had become the world's top source of refugees, overtaking afghanistan on average one out of every four refugees today is syrian
so what about alan kurdi? should we care?
some canadians, from the safety of anonymous newspaper comment sections, would say no, many refugees are muslim so not wanted and they will take our jobs or it's simply not our issue of course, those commenters conveniently ignore the fact that when your government sends cf- fighter jets to supposedly """"liberate"""" the libyan people and actively works to undermine the syrian government, it is your issue i would argue, therefore, that like the european union we also have a moral responsibility to take in more syrian refugees in part, this is due to our own middle eastern meddling but more so because according to immigration canada our country """"is recognized around the world for its leadership in offering a safe haven to people who need protection""""
so far, the government plans on accepting , syrians along with , more over a three-year period considering that , have already arrived, that's another , per year between now and likely  it's not that many when you think of the , vietnamese that arrived in just one year nor should we forget that some , kosovar refugees were brought to canada in  and that , of them classified as """"highly traumatized individuals"""" were airlifted here in just  days
given elections in canada are now on the horizon, it's easy for everyone to start pointing fingers but now is not the time for fingerpointing and to date canada has generously provided over $ million in humanitarian related aid for syria's refugees but what should we do now? well, if canada could take in , vietnamese refugees  years ago surely we can bring in , syrians now
and, if they do come, the simple fact is that the vast majority will not become burdens they will, taking my cue from icelandic author bryndis bjorgvinsdottir, become our future friends and co-workers, authors and architects, builders and baristas, the classmates of our children, the electrician with a story to tell

starting this week, police have the power to detain, question and demand a roadside breath sample from a driver even if there are no grounds that point to any alcohol consumption
foreign students, workers, visitors and permanent residents who are convicted under the new law will now lose their immigration status and be banned from canada - even if it's their first offence and they receive no jail time
and it is no longer just an offence to operate a vehicle while impaired; it is now also an offence to be impaired within two hours after operating a vehicle in other words, drive sober but have a few drinks afterwards and the script is flipped - it's now up to the accused to prove innocence
if these new police powers, trumpstyle immigration measures and courtroom shortcuts sound like a relic of the harper era tough-oncrime agenda, it's because they are the new liberal drunk-driving law is an almost perfect copy of an old conservative bill this was surprising political plagiarism from a government that said it """"will always stand up for the rights of canadians and will always respect the charter of rights and freedoms""""
in light of the liberals'new drunkdriving law, let me add to that pledge: """"unless you are a visible minority driving a car"""" visible minorities will be targeted under these new police powers experience has unfortunately demonstrated that """"random"""" detention and search powers are too often exercised in a non-random manner that disproportionately targets racialized and marginalized individuals
visible minorities were disproportionately arrested for marijuana offences and were disproportionately stopped and carded by the police
in , the results from the ottawa police's traffic stop race data collection project found visible minorities were disproportionately subjected to traffic stops the study also found that after being stopped, visible minorities were ticketed for driving infractions less often than non-racialized individuals in other words, minorities were more likely to be stopped by the police for no reason why should we expect things to be any different now that we have given the police even more power? for those minorities who are """"randomly"""" pulled over five,  or a dozen times for no obvious reason other than the colour of their skin, being required to submit to a breathalyzer will frequently be experienced as humiliating, degrading and offensive
perhaps this is why most canadians oppose the government's expansion of police powers or why the senate opposed these new powers and amended the law after hearing the testimony of experts
but the government rejected that senate amendment, along with an amendment that would have prevented foreign nationals and permanent residents from being automatically declared inadmissible to canada after a minor driving conviction

O Canada, we stand on guard for thee,"""" wrote Chandaria.","federal immigration policy a vote-getting scheme; liberal immigration policy provides the best insight into just how undemocratic and unworthy they are to govern this country
there are two reasons why the liberals in ottawa refuse to admit, or debate, the fact that this country has frightening immigration and refugee problems
it has nothing to do with public opinion public and private polls have consistently and dramatically documented that canadians are very concerned about the level of, and quality of, immigrants and refugees being allowed into this country they don't know what to do and don't want to stop immigration but they realize there are problems, anecdotally and instinctively we all do
that's why it is instructive to examine the way the liberals handle the issues around immigration it provides the best insight into just how undemocratic and unworthy they are to govern this country
reason : slander made easy
immigration is the best weapon the liberals have in their quiver anyone who criticizes immigration and refugee policies or processes or levels is always and immediately slandered and labelled as a """"racist"""" and """"anti-immigrant,"""" or even """"holocaust denier""""
the press duly reports these slanders, turning them into libel, which creates victims automatically that's because the victim is stuck with what's known in law as """"reverse onus"""" -- the only remedy for those unfairly labelled is to disprove the allegations
but there is no way to do that because when they defend, the press calls the liberals for comment and they repeat the libel so it's guilty until proven innocent, one more time
current immigration minister denis coderre illustrated the technique this past week by slandering the canadian alliance he deployed all the usual lies that its members were western rednecks, racists and would turn canada into an intolerant, horrid place mississippi run by le pen
what's most destructive is that if canadians, who are basically a decent and tolerant lot, keep hearing these allegations enough -- without any evidence to the contrary -- a permanent odour develops unimpeded, the odour is then escalated into the big lie and repeated constantly it's now to the point with the canadian alliance that anyone who claims to support or vote for them is asked, """"but aren't they a bunch of racists?"""" even by intelligent people
reason : swing ridings
liberal insiders tell me that there are dozens of ridings in this country where the immigrant population is large enough to swing the vote in their favour if immigration is an issue
it's interesting here to note, however, that immigrants like myself are as opposed to the current immigration and refugee situation as are native-borns
here's a comment from immigrant raj chandaria, who e-mailed me recently: """"i totally concur with your views as a recent ( years) immigrant, i was initially rejected as an applicant, despite having postgrad qualifications from the uk and us, speaking fluent french and english and various other positive points instead, canada lays out the welcome mat for terrorists, criminals and other non-desirables this country is beautiful, the people are wonderful and immigrants should thank their lucky stars that they have a chance to live here canada can attract the best and the brightest because of the quality of life let us practice what we sing    o canada, we stand on guard for thee,"""" wrote chandaria

their game is hideous and they have turned this country's political process upside down they have mccarthy-ized it their strategy means that the only way to unseat them is for opposition parties to unite and stay away from ever criticizing immigration or refugee policies and practices
it means ignoring the fact that two million people who have come into canada since  have not been economically assessed under the point system they have come in as relatives or as bogus refugees
it means ignoring the fact that the health and wealth of canadians have been badly damaged by this massive influx, equivalent to atlantic canada's population ottawa has opened the floodgates to an unknown number of people with aids, tb, criminal records, violent pasts, cultural problems, psychological and behavioural problems and more without education, language skills, intelligence or proper work habits

The older generation is getting out in large numbers and it seems too few replacements are in sight. """"We are not the preferred trade for students coming out of schools,"""" says the 51-year-old owner of Toronto- based Viana Roofing and Sheet Metal Ltd. """"We make presentations at colleges, but if students have a choice of becoming an electrician or a roofer, they choose electrician."""" But amid tremendous growth in Ontario residential and industrial construction sectors there also a shortage of electricians. Other tradespeople such as carpenters, plumbers and bricklayers are in high demand, too. A potential annual income of $100,000 and chances to become entrepreneurs have not been enough to reel young Canadians into the construction industry to replace an aging workforce. Things are so desperate that some employers are trying to steal workers from competitors. A forecast released in June by the Construction Sector Council (CSC) estimates that 85,000 new skilled workers will be needed in Ontario over the next nine years, with 50,000 of those required just to replace retirees. The situation has prompted those in the industry to look overseas for help. As a stop-gap measure, a provincial government program called CREWS (Construction Recruitment External Workers Services) was established in 2001 to help employers with the application process to bring in foreign temporary workers. It designed to help protect workers from unscrupulous consultants who charge huge fees foreign workers wish more could be brought in for longer, even permanent, stays. There are also large numbers of workers employed in an underground labour market without documents. DaCosta, a member of the CREWS board of directors, has relied on foreign workers to help meet the demands of his business. Among his 65-member staff, he has six workers who came to him through the CREWS program, mostly from Portugal. """"It costs $1,000 to bring a worker in through CREWS, which is much less than what consultants charge,"""" DaCosta says. """"Consultants charge $2,500 to $5,000 to fill out forms, which takes advantage of workers. When you bring a worker here through CREWS, you also pay for airfare, lodging and look after their well-being."""" Silvia Bendo, program manager for CREWS, says there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for roofers lately. Other trades experiencing severe shortages requiring foreign labourers include bricklayers, carpenters, cement finishers and framers. Last year, more than 300 job offers through CREWS were approved and the majority of those who came here were from Portugal, such as 33-year-old Luciano Acenso. He a roofer who has been trying for almost two years to achieve permanent status. """"The company I work for could easily bring in more workers,"""" Acenso says. """"It crazy busy with no shortage of work. On good days I work 11 to 12 hours and I work many weekends."""" He currently makes between $28 and $34 an hour, time-and-a-half on Saturdays and double time on Sundays.

unscrupulous consultants who charge huge fees foreign workers wish more could be brought in for longer, even permanent, stays there are also large numbers of workers employed in an underground labour market without documents dacosta, a member of the crews board of directors, has relied on foreign workers to help meet the demands of his business among his -member staff, he has six workers who came to him through the crews program, mostly from portugal """"it costs $, to bring a worker in through crews, which is much less than what consultants charge,"""" dacosta says """"consultants charge $, to $, to fill out forms, which takes advantage of workers when you bring a worker here through crews, you also pay for airfare, lodging and look after their well-being"""" silvia bendo, program manager for crews, says there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for roofers lately other trades experiencing severe shortages requiring foreign labourers include bricklayers, carpenters, cement finishers and framers last year, more than  job offers through crews were approved and the majority of those who came here were from portugal, such as -year-old luciano acenso he a roofer who has been trying for almost two years to achieve permanent status """"the company i work for could easily bring in more workers,"""" acenso says """"it crazy busy with no shortage of work on good days i work  to  hours and i work many weekends"""" he currently makes between $ and $ an hour, time-and-a-half on saturdays and double time on sundays but bringing in foreign help to alleviate shortages doesn't sit well with everyone mike yorke, president of carpenter union local  in york region, admits there is a problem finding enough workers for construction sites, but he does not feel foreign workers are the answer """"crews is not really a solution we're looking at,"""" he says """"our focus is to work on youth outreach"""" yorke speaks proudly about the training programs in the union $-million-plus, ,-squarefoot centre at weston rd and highway  """"we tell young people when we go to high schools that they don't have to be carpenters forever,"""" he says """"they can eventually own their own business if they want it a career with lots of opportunities when they start, they make $ an hour and work their way up once they're fully trained with , hours as apprentices, they'll make $ to $ an hour with overtime they can be making $, a year"""" to help spread the word about the benefits of construction careers, yorke says his union formed a partnership with school boards and the provincial government to create the ontario youth apprenticeship program five years ago grade  and  students come into the training facility in march in may they head out to sites where they make $ to $ an hour at the end of the summer, some go back to school, some go to college or university and some stay to start apprenticeships another initiative is the choice program with the ymca and the toronto community housing corp (tchc) """"we train young people who live at tchc properties for six weeks and then put them in the field to renovate tchc properties,"""" yorke says """"they're very proud of what they do and get a lot of respect for their efforts"""" as far as george gritziotis, executive president of the construction sector council, is concerned, youth, along with (adult) women and aboriginals, are the future of ontario construction industry """"i don't usually take the time to talk to reporters,"""" he says """"but this is an important issue """"what we're seeing is that we don't have the training and infrastructure to respond to higher demands  we want to invest your tax dollars to encourage kids in regions where demand is to replenish workers a critical piece is a planning tool to forecast the future, so we have the products and initiatives to train kids"""" some of the projects the csc is working on include an aboriginal website to be released this fall, incorporating construction examples into math for the toronto district school board, and additional outreach to school systems even with these programs, there are still not enough students signing on to become tradespeople which brings us back to the issue of foreign temporary workers five-hundred temporary foreign workers are eligible to enter canada each year, but the actual numbers always fall below this quota, bendo of crews says that partly because there is still not a great awareness of the program employers may also be loath to pay the $, for every worker they bring in through crews peter ferreira, a former immigration officer and now a licensed paralegal immigration consultant, says that """"because the quota is not reached doesn't mean there isn't a demand"""" he says more of these workers are coming in than we realize some come legally, without crews, and others are just not legal he says the figure usually used, by agencies, unions and companies who work with the immigrant population, is about , undocumented workers in canada """"many employers who don't use crews approach me to get a labour market opinion from human resources skills development canada (hrsdc),"""" ferreira says """"my mission is to get hrsdc to say they are satisfied the company has attempted to recruit canadians therefore, they have no objection to hiring foreign workers"""" but there is one nagging problem for both employers and temporary employees -- uncertainty as to how long the permit will be valid for employers such as dacosta, who spend more than a year training new employees, the question is """"whether or not to invest in a worker if i may lose him in a year"""" and employees like acenso are getting frustrated because they want to purchase a house here, or invest some of their income, but they don't know if they'll be around tomorrow ferreira, who works with  clients a year to attain permanent status, says that even though these temporary workers are helping construction keep up with demand,  per cent of them will never have enough """"points"""" required by ottawa to achieve permanent residence here the federal government requires skilled foreign workers to accumulate  out of a possible  points in order to qualify for permanent status points are given for things such as post-secondary education, proficiency in english or french and work experience """"nowadays, the only people who can get the  points required have a degree completed and fluency in one official language,"""" ferreira says """"in general terms, those working in the construction industry don't have a college or university education if the government truly believes they are contributing to canada, they need to do something about it"""" one obvious change ferreira points to is making the temporary worker program more like the live- in caregiver program participants in this program can apply for permanent residence after working full-time for two years and are usually accepted, regardless of education or language skills since this is not an option for temporary foreign workers, ferreira says a lot of these single men end up getting married sooner than they planned so they can apply for residence under the spousal program karen shadd-evelyn, spokesperson for citizenship and immigration canada (cic) in ottawa, says the temporary foreign worker program is a demand-driven program while the live-in caregiver program is designed to meet a very specific need """"because of the unique demands of the occupation, the opportunity for permanent status after a limited period has always been a feature of the caregiver program"""" shadd-evelyn adds that when discussing permanent residency, it is important to remember that canada admits about , permanent residents a year and the backlog is still about , applicants changing the eligibility criteria would likely just expand this backlog, she says """"immigration, both temporary and permanent, will always be secondary to the training and integration of canadian job-seekers into jobs"""" that being said, there have been some measures recently introduced to simplify and accelerate the hiring of foreign temporary workers, shadd-evelyn says employers who need workers with less formal training can now employ these workers for up to  months instead of the former  months labour market opinions and work permits can now be processed at the same time for certain skills, and the  federal budget announced $ million over two years to improve the temporary foreign worker program by streamlining requirements, a better response time to labour and skill shortages, and improved protection of foreign workers but deciding what best for canada is not so easy """"crews helps bridge the gap but our perfect solution would be training of domestic workers,"""" says stephen dupuis, ceo, greater toronto home builders' association as for acenso, he on his fourth work permit he hasn't seen his parents in three years because if he leaves there is no guarantee of reentry to canada if his work permit is not renewed, he moving back home to portugal to learn more about crews, visit

1806009774,The narrative of white privilege doesn't hold up,"Despite their numbers, we don't hear a great deal about racial discrimination against Chinese or South Asian people.","  canada is one of the most welcoming and immigrant-friendly countries in the world, a place others look to as a model for how to build a pluralistic society and yet, we are still told that we live in a nation riven by racism, where the majority keeps its """"white privilege"""" intact by marginalizing people who are of a different skin colour
sure, canadian police officers and black people are not gunning each other down in the streets on a regular basis, but that doesn't mean that white people are not conspiring to keep other folks down as my colleague angelina chapin said in a recent column, """"the desire for white people to guard their privilege like a pot of gold is destructive and delusional""""
white privilege is generally defined as special advantages given to people simply because they are white whites help other whites, the story goes, keeping others on the fringes yes, people can point to black, east indian or chinese people who have succeeded in pretty much every area of canadian society, but look how many more good jobs and powerful positions are held by white people
it's not surprising that white people would dominate many spheres of activity in canada they make up about  per cent of the population and their families have typically been here far longer than those of immigrants from nonwhite parts of the world among g countries, canada has by far the largest percentage of its population born elsewhere, at  per cent
if the big priority for white people was maintaining their supposed white privilege, why would canada be admitting so many non-white immigrants? why would we have federal laws encouraging employment of visible minorities and human rights commissions to protect them? in canada, we even fuss because the top people at our spy agency are not sufficiently diverse
to those who see white privilege everywhere, even hiring targets for visible minorities are another manifestation in a head-spinning example cited by the cbc, a representative of the elementary teachers of toronto said that when white people assume a black person got her job because of quota hiring, that's white privilege
a look at how immigrants are doing overall in canada provides some useful context
canadian immigrants primarily come from south asia, china and the african and caribbean nations combined, those groups account for  per cent of the visible minority population
despite their numbers, we don't hear a great deal about racial discrimination against chinese or south asian people nor do we hear much about their lack of economic success in part, this is because they come from countries that have strong economies and education systems placing a high value on education is particularly important immigrants of asian background are achieving a higher rate of postsecondary education than other canadians are black canadians are in a different situation slightly more than half of canadian blacks are foreign-born, and many have arrived in recent years, primarily from haiti, nigeria and jamaica that background puts them at a relative disadvantage to other immigrants it's not a surprise black people aren't doing quite as well as some other immigrants
while there are many individual success stories, black people as a group have had less success than anyone would like it's convenient to blame that on racism on the part of white canadians, but it's not convincing if other immigrant groups are doing well in our white privilege society, why not blacks? clearly, some black people feel that things are so bad that they have to assert that black lives matter yes, they do, and they will get better when black people start doing a better job of lifting each other up
in canada, self-flagellation is almost a national sport we are always wringing our hands over some group that is said to be treated unfairly no doubt our country is imperfect, but ask yourself this: if canada is such a racist society, why do so many non-white people keep choosing it as their home?

this summer, garfinkel was appointed psychiatrist-in-chief of the clarke institute of psychiatry and head of the department of psychiatry at the university of toronto he had been chief psychiatrist at toronto hospital and vice-chairman of the department at u of t
the prevalence of mental illness in this country may come as a shock to the fortunate few who have remained untouched by family tragedies
in ontario, about  million people have some form of mental illness and about , people have a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, according to a  clarke report
the same study notes family physicians can spend up to  per cent of their time handling emotional or psychiatric problems
in , there were  suicides in ontario - more than  a week - according to the chief coroner's report sixty per cent of the suicides are attributable to depressive illness, adds another report
but there is a shortage of psychiatrists in some areas
""""there is no question that we must make more psychiatric help available throughout all regions of ontario,"""" says garfinkel """"there are crucial shortages in certain fields, such as psychiatric care for children
""""we must have better identification of psychiatric problems by everyone, parents, school nurses, primary care physicians we have to be on guard for depression in young people and be aware of the high rate of suicide among teenagers""""
by conservative estimates, about  per cent of canadians under  are in need of mental health services and while  per cent of children met the criteria for diagnosis of psychiatric disorder in a study of pediatric practice, only  per cent had received referrals to mental health services
two other areas of particular interest to garfinkel are """"transcultural psychiatry"""" and women's mental health
""""the very ethnic diversity of (metro) toronto makes understanding mental illness as it occurs in different cultures an important area for investigation,"""" notes garfinkel """"health professionals must examine what is the meaning of illness in different cultures

The federal Liberals are worried Canada is losing out on the international claims rush. Gone are the days when Liberals erected walls around the country and tacked up Do Not Enter signs to protect domestic industries from takeovers. The theory then was the foreign domination of the Canadian economy would drain profits and capital out of the country. And that a branch plant economy deprived Canadians of economic sovereignty and domestic head-office control.,"  ottawa - the hopeful prospectors of the temagami have nothing on industry minister john manley and trade minister art eggleton
as hordes descend on the northern ontario region in search of gold, the two liberal ministers have embarked on a global prospecting mission panning for nuggets of international capital
the federal liberals are worried canada is losing out on the international claims rush
the country share of worldwide direct investment - corporate investment in plant, equipment, research and other business operations - has declined precipitously since the s
it wasn't supposed to be that way
when the conservatives negotiated the north american free trade agreement, they hyped the deal as positioning canada as the gateway to the vast north american market
and the liberals ran with that theme when they signed the deal
now, it seems the united states is the location of choice for foreign investors, while mexico provides cheap labor and canada provides    what?
resources, such as natural gas, and a place to take a vacation?
``some of our advantages of being part of the large nafta market are being lost, particularly to the united states and also to mexico, in attracting investment,'' manley said in an interview
and that means lost opportunity in terms of jobs
in , canadian subsidiaries accounted for  per cent of global foreign investment, or $ billion of the $ billion in total assets owned by foreign investors
by , canada share had dropped to  per cent of the total $ trillion in assets, or $ billion
the liberals now say that lower share of foreign investment has meant fewer jobs for canadians and a smaller economy
gone are the days when liberals erected walls around the country and tacked up do not enter signs to protect domestic industries from takeovers the theory then was the foreign domination of the canadian economy would drain profits and capital out of the country and that a branch plant economy deprived canadians of economic sovereignty and domestic head-office control
now the liberals have adopted the open-for-business mentality of the former conservative government under then-prime minister brian mulroney
the controversial foreign investment review agency, a notorious gatekeeper under the liberals in the s and early s, became the toothless investment canada under the market-oriented conservatives
prohibitions on further acquisitions in the already-foreign- dominated oil and gas sector were gradually whittled back until they have been pretty much dropped by the liberals
only the sensitive cultural industry and banking have effective prohibitions on foreign takeovers, and even those are being challenged
manley said the old policies of liberal protectionism are passe
``i think every government has to deal with the challenges of its own decade,'' he said
``and we've seen incremental increases in the unemployment rate decade after decade in canada right now, the priority of the government and preoccupation of canadians is jobs''
as a result, he and eggleton have joined forces to open an investment partnership office, which will use industry canada links with domestic firms and international trade network of overseas commerce officers
eggleton said the new office will develop ``strategic plans,'' using the expertise of both departments, for getting more direct foreign investment in canada
in recent weeks, eggleton has travelled to germany to lobby for more canadian investment last month, manley completed an around-the-world tour, with investment meetings in japan, sweden and the netherlands
manley said the sales pitch combines canada low-cost business environment and well- educated work force, quality of life and well developed social programs
he said senior executives with multinational companies overseas are often shocked to learn that canada is no longer a high-cost place to do business
``i encountered a lot of surprise on the part of business people in large multinationals about the numbers i was giving them on canada and our competitiveness,'' he said
among other things, manley touts:
* canada corporate tax burden is highly competitive measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, the tax load is just slightly above that in the united states and united kingdom, and well below germany, japan, italy and france
tax incentives for research and development are among the most generous in the world
* canada has the lowest labor costs in the group of  industrialized nations, slightly below the united states and significantly lower than europe and japan
in a booklet prepared for the overseas investment-prospecting, the government boasts that ``competition and a soft labor market'' (read: high unemployment) are keeping wage settlements down
* over the last three years, canada has had one of the lowest inflation rates in the world (the booklet does not mention that is because the economy has been on its knees for six years)
* free trade agreements provide access to the vast american and mexican markets
but he also notes that canada has the highest rate of post-secondary enrolment in the world, a top-notch public health-care system and strong multilingual capabilities, thanks in part to a huge immigrant population
and he boasts about the country sophisticated transportation and telecommunications infrastructure and financial markets
labor leader bob white sees a tremendous amount of irony in the liberals' sales pitch
and he wonders whether the country isn't selling its economic sovereignty to attract multinational investment
on the one hand, manley and eggleton seem to be selling canada on the basis of a free market approach: low corporate taxes, low inflation, free trade and a low-wage economy
``of course there been a shift in emphasis to job-security issues from wage increases,'' said white, president of the canadian labour congress
``that only because people are trying to hang on to what they have and in a lot of cases, the resulting lower labor costs are because corporations have taken away what wage and benefits people have earned over the years''
on the other hand, the ministers are highlighting canada good education, excellent health care and other quality-of-life issues, while the government is chopping away at them
``the things that we argue that make canada a good place to invest and a good nation in which to locate jobs are under attack by the federal and provincial governments: an education system, a good health-care system and good training system,'' white said
``those are the areas in which they've done the most cutting it a bit of a double standard when you look at what they're saying overseas compared with what they're doing at home''

the question is irrelevant, but the answer is yes sane people do not board a ship sailing to an unknowable destination, in a light frivolous way the circumstances in which these tamil migrants left sri lanka were not happy they were on the losing side of something very like a civil war i could go on for some paragraphs describing the fix they were in -- the greater for those of greatest danger to us in canada, if they were in fact associated with the tamil tigers; and whose word, if they say they now regret this association, cannot be taken at face value

as a public policy, """"compassion"""" is nearly always a fraud; and i have inserted the word """"nearly"""" only in case i think of an exception after filing this column i can't think of one now
when, for instance, a certain george w bush jr was first running for president of the us, with a political message of """"compassionate conservatism,"""" my comment was that he means some kind of fraudulent conservatism when brian mulroney described canada socialist and dysfunctional medical system as a """"sacred trust,"""" i called it irish smarm it is unfortunate that electorates aren't better trained to spot snake-oil salesmanship, but there you go democracy lasts, in this world, for only as long as the people remain astute
we are lucky, for the moment, to have a party in power that owes nothing to the tamil tigers for the liberals, the sham of """"compassion"""" extended to fundraising events with their goons, and the settled party understanding that any large, fairly desperate, and culturally exotic pool of welfare-propending immigrants will make reliable liberal voting fodder hence side-splitting expostulations of compassion
hence, a canadian immigration system that is actually designed to be dysfunctional, and advertises opportunities for abuse it is no accident that it takes very little time to become a fully-voting canadian citizen, but a lot of time to deport even the most flagrantly illegal visitor to this country, once he has """"opted"""" to stay it is no accident that an immense vested interest has been assembled in the form of immigration lawyers, who will scream pink bluster when their own gravy train is impeded
the liberals built and own canada immigration system, together with the justifying public policy of """"multiculturalism,"""" that the trudeau government summoned while pointing a demographic hose at major english-speaking urban areas, back in the s we take it for granted that no tory today can hope to win a seat in toronto or vancouver, or any other dense urban environment this result did not come about naturally
we must accept the consequences of past immigration policy, and the political difficulties in persuading past beneficiaries that they will not benefit from its continuation for there is such a thing as a tipping point, past which an entire country becomes dysfunctional -- because the cultural virtues on which it depended have been squandered
in this respect, the public ideal of """"multiculturalism"""" does far more harm than open immigration, though the one policy depends on the other, and both are aggravated by the venal attractions of a welfare state
a society in which all social, economic, and cultural values are optional, and in which, moreover, all traditional and received values are placed under formal suspicion, is a society that is disintegrating it is a society in which the self-serving rule, the dutiful are in their way, and hypocrisy is consistently rewarded
the poor souls aboard the sun sea were unlikely to have much, if any understanding of the canadian circumstances into which they were projecting themselves nor can they be blamed for receiving all kinds of material assistance at the expense of the canadian taxpayer, for which they did not specifically ask their own interests are immediate, and exclude those of their new host nation; after all, their first choice for landing was australia
yet the whole process by which they were delivered was a cynical manipulation, of an immigration system designed to be cynically manipulated
paradoxically, we could better afford to accept refugees at a time when it was clear that each applicant must assimilate in the """"melting pot"""" of an established canadian society, would be watched, and would be under compulsion to earn his way as a test of his commitment
we cannot be held to account for the mess in sri lanka; nor, from this distance, are we in a position to judge tamil claims of persecution, after an armed conflict in which the tamil side was governed by an obviously terrorist organization
and while we are now compelled to review each refugee claimant under our existing laws, we'd be fools not to change those laws to prevent further cynical manipulation

2104640256,We the Norse? Viking relics ranked high amid 1930s Gothicism:   How the ROM was fooled for decades by a Viking hoax in northern Ontario,Aucun(e) disponible.,"charles trick currelly, the renowned rom archeology director, paid $ in  for relics supposedly found a few years earlier by prospector eddy dodd at the time, the discovery in beardmore, ont, satisfied a thirst to confirm that the viking voyages described in legends did indeed extend to canada, and went deep inside the country but did norse adventurers of , years ago really make it inland from hudson bay? in beardmore: the viking hoax that rewrote history, author douglas hunter looks at the origins and lasting power of the beardmore hoax
on sept , , a small canadian press story that related the news out of fort william of viking relics caught the eye of an unknown henry morgan executive in montreal he glued the clipping """"historic armor stirs interest"""" to a sheet of letterhead, jotted beside it """"can these things be?"""" and mailed it to ct currelly the director of the royal ontario museum of archeology responded on sept  although no reply is preserved, the clipping indicates that teddy elliott's subsequent letter of nov , , revealing dodd's weapons cache, could not have come as a complete surprise
the contents of elliott's letter electrified currelly the enclosed drawings of dodd's relics, he would recall, """"sent me right up into the air"""" they suggested to currelly that dodd possessed """"one of the early types of the norse sword, th to th century the axe could very well also be norse, and the pick-like piece might be a good many things"""" currelly wondered if elliott would write dodd """"to beg him to send the things down here,"""" if only for the sake of preservation but instead of mailing the letter, currelly, like tl tanton before him, decided to set aside his reply to the schoolteacher and to write eddy dodd directly on nov 
from the beginning of his collecting activities, currelly had struggled with two opposing tensions one was the fear of missing out on opportunities by not acting quickly and decisively, which caused much personal and financial anxiety in his early acquisition years currelly routinely encountered what he considered once-in-a-lifetime chances in a market dominated by major institutions and private collectors with far larger budgets than what was available to him the other tension was the fear of being duped by fakes
throughout his career, currelly had to make snap decisions on acquisition opportunities there was no time for prolonged investigations of provenance, and all museum directors of his generation had to contend with the ephemeral if not nonexistent archeological documentation for many of the objects they collected currelly had been fortunate to work under flinders petrie, a pioneering figure in scientific archeology in egypt and palestine
but most of currelly's collecting from the beginning of his career involved dealers as well as ordinary people who appeared at excavations with purportedly ancient items to sell his archeology experience ended in ; thereafter, he was exclusively a buyer, not an excavator, of relics currelly could not know for certain the origins of items, and his memories of collecting in egypt and the mediterranean were animated by an ever-present and understandable concern that he would be duped
the rise of public museums along with private collectors in the late th century created a ravenous market for relics, which could only encourage fakes as currelly advised sir byron edmund walker at the start of his - season with petrie, forgeries outnumbered authentic items on the market by a margin of  to one
currelly considered petrie to be one of the best at spotting fakes, and he learned everything he could from him after currelly's first season in egypt, he passed a key test with sir william ridgeway, disney professor of archaeology at cambridge, by correctly identifying some egyptians scarabs as exquisite fakes because he saw that they were made from labradorite the ridgeway test was one of currelly's stories, and the wealthy philanthropists who funded currelly's museum acquisitions must have been comforted by the idea that his exceptional eye spared them from underwriting worthless acquisitions
however, there was a difference between items that were forgeries and items that were authentic but had been planted in a sensational location to increase their significance and value new world archeology had a long history of both authentic and fraudulent items that people claimed to have dug up and that proved the presence of ancient romans, phoenicians and other old world peoples
discoveries of authentic ancient coins were easy to fake, their being readily available from numismatists other items, like the weapons hjalmar holand presented as evidence of norsemen, could be brought to north america by immigrants as heirlooms and then proclaimed as remarkable discoveries
currelly explained to dodd that elliott had sent """"some quite good drawings of a sword, an axe and a couple of other things that he saw in your house they are intensely interesting, because if his drawings are right, they may very well be norse"""" he asked dodd to send the items to the museum at the rom's expense so that, at the very least, they could be preserved
""""if you can give or obtain proof that these were not planted there by some norwegian or swede in recent years, we will be willing to give you a very good price for them""""
despite his caution about the possibility of fraud, currelly volunteered circumstantial evidence to support dodd's find, including the kensington stone """"it is known that the norsemen came down into minnesota and left an inscription, and of course indians may have brought the pieces long ago down into the long lac, or norsemen themselves may have come down there the last is rather unlikely, i think, though mr stefansson [currelly's friend, vilhjalmur stefansson] told me that he had every reason to feel sure the norsemen had landed in the hudson bay and had not come up from the east coast of america""""
initially, then, currelly doubted norsemen had been anywhere near beardmore; rather, he suspected the relics had some relation to the kensington stone [the kensington stone, which contained ancient writings, was found in minnesota in , but decades later came to be considered a fake]
currelly's remarks call to mind an exchange of letters the previous year with knute haddeland of the league of norsemen in canada haddeland had sent currelly a clipping of an article he had published in the winnipeg tribune magazine on nov , , """"viking colonies predated columbus,"""" which endorsed holand's kensington stone theorizing and included a map showing the route the knutson party took deep into the continent via hudson bay - a route that in haddeland's interpretation employed the albany river, which empties into james bay in northern ontario
""""the explorations of the intrepid early norsemen were primarily within the border of what is now canada and, therefore, should be of particular interest to canadians,"""" haddeland had lectured currelly in reply, currelly noted: """"my friend stefansson has been very much interested in the matter of the norsemen in america, and has talked a good deal about the minnesota inscribed stone, which he found most interesting""""
currelly informed haddeland that the museum had just acquired another viking sword it was from a private collection in paris and was said to have been found in the seine currelly presumed that it had been lost in the great viking siege of the city in the late th century a year after buying the paris sword, currelly had the opportunity to acquire relics that would endorse the view of norse explorations that stefansson propounded and that was otherwise contentiously supported by the kensington stone
currelly's interest in the beardmore weapons tapped several undercurrents of historical interest, museum policy and cultural framing
the archeology division placed a strong emphasis on european history, which currelly believed could be taught through its wars in an object-based educational setting there was no better way to teach wars than with weapons currelly knew that a key audience for his museum's collection was schoolboys - perhaps more than schoolgirls - and that weaponry sparked imaginations with a glorious if violent past across the atlantic norse weapons carried deep ethnohistorical connotations
the letter from knute haddeland of the league of norsemen in canada was a reminder of the continued strength of the home-making myth in scandinavian communities, which the museum's sword purchases fed, even if they were not north american relics but currelly was more interested in what norse artefacts said to most museum goers, who had a british heritage
since the th century, norse fascinations in north america, especially among anglo-americans in new england, had been buoyed by a view of race, culture, and history that scholars call gothicism gothicism embodies a mélange of paganism, a hardy warrior ethos, freedom-loving republicanism, chivalry, protestant morality and white racial superiority
it constantly shifts shape to suit the needs of its advocates, but in its essential form it contends that white people from northern europe are the finest human race, descended from japheth, a son of noah favoured by god these northern european whites hailed from the wellspring of modern civilization and overthrew the southern tyrannies of the imperial romans and roman catholicism gothicism encoded and legitimized powerful notions of race-based entitlement and privilege where colonization in the americas was concerned 
in canada, gothicism fused the lore of vikings with the british heritage and allegiance of the country's dominant class the gothicist sentiment within the rom in the s was such that viking relics were more important than anything that survived from the ancien régime of french canada, and indigenous materials were a low acquisition and display priority the distinction between the british as a biological race and as a culture and nation was as ephemeral as were the distinctions applied to other peoples in the western worldview, and racial fitness was a bedrock notion of immigration policies in canada and the united states
""""white racism  was a universal feature of britannic nationalism in the settlement colonies,"""" john herd thompson writes of canada in the first decades of the th century ct currelly, to his credit, never stooped to the aryanist racism of hjalmar holand in extolling the superior nature of norse adventurers (especially where indigenous peoples were concerned)
currelly's claims of ancient italian roots defied the blatant racism that infected the most virulent strain of gothicism and its intertwined sentiments of british imperialism, and his respect for craftsmanship inoculated him against a blindered devotion to britishness at the expense of other cultures
still, currelly's public discussions of the beardmore relics would have an undeniable if lightly wielded gothicist edge norse weapons of any origin were freighted with connotations of a deep cultural heritage claimed by the british and their imperial descendants in canada through the norman invasion of england
in january , currelly would state that the vikings """"to a certain degree are our own ancestors (because we must all have a bit of norse blood in us if we are british)"""" the beardmore relics were an unparalleled opportunity to bridge the old and new worlds through weaponry, one of currelly's favourite instructive tools, within a complex ethnic and imperialist context the relics placed the vikings in the landscape with a sword, which was always treated with the greatest priority by anyone discussing eddy dodd's find
a sword conveyed power, authority and daring it conjured the sweep of a norseman's arm in claiming a new land for the gothicist descendants who ultimately would settle it

in fact, the latter is actually in the process of being institutionalized in the global compact for migration between un member states, which stipulates, among other regulatory provisions, the return of irregular migrants to countries of origin - whether those countries want them back or not
thanks to the ongoing mediterranean refugee crisis in europe, trump's egregious immigration policies, the uk's insecurity over border control and canada's own overplayed policy on mass economic immigration, """"immigrant,"""" has become a dirty word
since the komagata maru was turned away from canada's pacific coast, to anti-italianism in late th century united states, to the south asian """"paki"""" influx in 's uk, willing and unwilling migrants have always been looked upon as outsiders they have been seen as outsiders who need to be """"included,"""" integrated"""" and even """"mainstreamed,"""" and who, more recently, are """"diverse"""" and """"newcomers""""

one of the reasons i have never taken to the word immigrant, even though technically i am one, is because of its sheer permanency once an immigrant, always an immigrant even successive generations are haplessly labelled into categories of first, second, third, etc
and not only do we let others closet us into these categories, but we do it to ourselves our degree of success is measured by our desire to be one of """"canada's top  immigrants"""" and no, that's not a reality tv show, it's an annual awards event
simply succumbing to these tactics denotes that we have come to terms with the idea we will never be accepted into our host society as equals that we will always have to prove ourselves as worthy employees, entrepreneurs, business persons and the like, before we can be accepted into the white-picket-fence mould
dina nayeri, a refugee from iran to the united states, wrote a long-read in the guardian last year, entitled, the ungrateful refugee: we have no debt to repay"""" in it, she speaks of the discrimination faced in her new country, all the while being made to feel how fortunate she was to be there the secret to her acceptance, she realized, was to be grateful and to acknowledge her hosts as saviours
we have witnessed this behaviour in canada with the syrian refugees we constantly promote the good that we have done in providing refuge to the nationless and cannot get enough """"thank you canada's"""", each time a refugee is profiled for the media
but in nyeri's words, how much do we actually owe to our hosts, based on our pre-packaged immigrant status? most of us have had to fight to be where we are today, including refugees; for jobs, housing, education we earned the right to be where we are today, just as much as anyone who was born here particularly, since we want exactly what everyone else does; respect, opportunity and security but while for others, no questions need to be asked, for us """"immigrants,"""" the question remains of """"will we ever be good enough?""""
of course, none of this applies to when policies are being developed to encourage mass economic migration, because more immigrants mean more money (except under trump's usa) even more refugees mean more money, once their debts to the host country have been paid off (most refugees to canada have to repay an immigration loan to the government after a stipulated period)
this makes the discussion on migration today a heavily political tool in which we are mere pawns in a greater global game the global compact on migration, or its counterpart, the global compact on refugees, can be categorized as tools for """"migration governance"""" but they ultimately choose to play with our lives as if we aren't real just the way prime minster justin trudeau could claim to welcome everyone being tormented by donald trump, but in the next breath send his immigration minister to a war-torn and impoverished country in an effort to convince them to stop people from fleeing to canada
at what point do politics end and does reality begin, or vice versa?
at what point can we break away from our past and become the present and, through that, the future?
at what point can we stop being immigrants and just be who we are - humans in an unequal world
i for one stand for being called simply that

((Page B5).","star columnist richard gwyn delivered the d g willmot distinguished lecture at brock university in st catharines, on nov ,  the following is an edited version
within not much more than  years, perhaps a good deal less, canada may no longer exist the canadian national chronicle could end, quite quickly, in a kind of regretful sigh
or the opposite may happen canada may complete its evolution into a society unlike any other we may become the world first post-modern nation, inventing ways others may follow in which people almost infinite in their variety can still cohere into a self- sustaining and a creative collectivity
it seems extravagant, if not absurd, to suggest that a people like ourselves, pragmatic, self-effacing, addicted to the golden mean of muddling through, could blaze a global trail
yet this is what we are doing already no other country is multicultural officially no other has so comprehensive a constitutional guarantee of gender equality no other is as decentralized, that is to say does so much of its governance so close to its citizens no other is changing its own demography so dramatically: our immigration program is the largest in the world
these policies cause stresses and strains but all are the essential components of a post-modern society, provided we can find a way to contain all our disparate parts within a whole larger than their sum an impossible goal for canadians except that pierre trudeau, in , forecast that canada could be """"a brilliant prototype for the building of tomorrow civilization""""
the alternate scenario - that our nation-state might soon peter out - is, of course, a more shocking one yet who, even a decade ago, predicted the erosions to our national identity now happening to us, or that we would accept them so passively
the dissolution of our single pan-canadian sporting competition - the canadian football league the appointment of non-canadians to head such central national institutions as the globe and mail and air canada
or the choice made by millions of canadians that their national birthright entitles them to spend the dollars they have earned in canada outside of canada, or at least to have done so until the decline in the value of our dollar eliminated most of the benefits of cross-border shopping
if a people do not shop together, do not play games together, do not holiday amongst each other - maclean once brilliantly titled a cover story: my canada includes florida - can they really stay together?
my own response is: yes, we can
most forecasts for canada demise assume quebec separation as its immediate cause but next year referendum has been lost already - by the separatists only malignant stupidity by the rest of us could alter this result
the narrowness of the electoral victory of the parti quebecois and the subsequent decline in support for sovereignty in the polls strongly suggest this but the essential reason quebecers no longer feel the need to separate is because they are already separate, culturally and psychically and in almost all practical respects rather than a mere distinct society, quebec is a distinct nation within confederation it one of the ways we have already become a post-modern state which isn't at all to say that quebecers' cultural concerns will not - forever - challenge our nation-state
this, though, is a familiar, indeed an age-old, theme in the canadian debate but what are the new themes?
the erosion of the nation-state
it always possible that our nation-state will muddle along for many more decades inertia is the most powerful political force of all but this middle ground may not hold for us for long
that globalization is undermining nation-states the world over is the great cliche of contemporary commentary the canadian nation- state is threatened uniquely, though
we've always been at least two nations, and many more, depending upon how the first nations are counted relevant also is that we - most of us - have never been distinct, ethnically and lingustically, from our overpowering neighbor
instead, our distinct identity has always resided in our political distinctiveness we've depended upon state enterprises, canadian national, cbc, air canada, petrocanada, to ensure that we owned essential parts of our national infrastructure and also to alter the character of our market economy
our political discourse has always depended upon civility and compromise rather than, as south of the border, upon the free- market virtues of competitiveness and the quest for victory it been said often, but does still say most of what needs to be said, that our national goal is """"peace, order and good government"""" while that of americans is, much more ambitiously and aggressively, """"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""""
other nations have survived the vanishing of their nation-state, in the instance of the french for four years of wartime occupation, of poles during  years of partition, of jews during a thousand- year disapora
but can a people defined by their state survive its vanishing?
the forces of globalization, of the trans-national movement of goods and services, of capital, of production facilities, of know- how, of technology, of consumer tastes, cannot be halted at national borders regional groupings - the european union, nafta - are quickening the unravelling of the nation-states that form their membership the european union members are committed to a single currency an equivalent financial homgeneity has been forecast for nafta by paul volker, former president of the us federal reserve bank
amidst globalization and regionalization, nation-states can no longer fulfil their original economic purposes they cannot ameliorate significantly business cycles, they cannot guarantee their citizens full employment nor protect them from the effects of international capital and technology and trade instead, employment is now largely the responsibility of each individual the most a nation-state can do - it is still a lot - is to improve its citizens' employability by well-judged investments in infrastructure
a post-war justification for nation-states has been to protect their citizens from the marketplace by turning themselves into welfare states often, as between canada and the us, it is differences in social security systems that most distinguish nation- states now
but the assumptions upon which all post-war welfare states have been built - the attainability of full employment; the attainability of perpetual increases in national wealth - are in fundamental doubt now the gap between these past assumptions and contemporary reality is measured by our debt and annual deficits we cannot continue the style of welfare state to which we have become accustomed it will have to be reformed, restructured, reduced in the process, though, we'll diminish our national distinctiveness, most certainly vis-a- vis the us
one other external force is altering the character of our nation- state this the """"information revolution"""" consider two slogans used to describe it: the global village the wired world
in a global village, where is the space left for a th century construct like the nation-state? in a totally wired world, what meaning is left to national boundaries? will they be replaced by the so-called """"virtual communities"""" in which an individual, living in st catharines, say, can, by way of the internet, e-mail, fax and lap-top computers, live simultaneously here and in san francisco or new york or london or tokyo, as a full member of a geographically separated community of like-minded people
what about the effect of the promised  channels of television? the french analyst elihu katz has written about the loss of what he calls """"the public space,"""" or the commonality between citizens of each nation-state what will we all say to each other around the water cooler when none of us have watched the same programs the evening before?
this condition won't be unique to us but it will affect us especially our popular culture is not our own culture our magazine stands, our movie theatres, our tv, our pop music, bathe us in the ideas and images of the culture of our neighboring nation-state our public space is already narrowing sharply today, cbc-tv accounts for  per cent of the audience in english-speaking canada a decade ago, its share was  per cent
in all these ways, the canadian nation-state is certain to become, year after year, less and less relevant to the daily, practical lives of canadians
the implosion of the nation-state
internal forces are having the same hollowing- out effect i've already noted quebec virtual separation within canada native peoples are moving along the same path, negotiating their own legal systems, educational systems, policing systems, local linguistic regulations
we are the only country in the world in which most citizens do not identify themselves as citizens of that country we identify ourselves instead by region, as albertans or quebecers or newfoundlanders or we identify ourselves by ethnicity, as italian canadians, somali canadians, ukrainian canadians
in effect, more and more canadians are re-writing the terms of their contract with the canadian nation-state to suit their own circumstances more accurately, we are allowing these contracts to be re-interpreted without thinking through - without daring to try to - the consequences and the alternatives
multiculturalism is the case-example it was created, in , by the customary coupling of political opportunism and good intentions those intentions really were honorable: to inculcate among canadians greater sensitivity and understanding towards so-called """"new canadians;"""" to make it easier for newcomers to integrate by softening the cultural shock they all underwent
rather than bringing us together, though, multiculturalism i believe has become a system that pushing us further apart it the principal reason why there are no canadians in canada, only hyphenated ones, the single exception, ironically, being quebecers in his recently-published book, selling illusions, neil bissoondath writes, """"depending on stereotype, ensuring that ethnic groups will preserve their distinctiveness in a gentle and insidious form of cultural apartheid, multiculturalism has done little more than lead an already divided land down the path to further social divisiveness""""
bissoondath use of the phrase """"social divisiveness"""" is especially apt at its inception, multiculturalism was assumed by the public to be intended to mean legitimating cultural differences, as of folklore, of music and dance and song, and even, if only temporarily, of language today, multiculturalism is being used to legitimate social differences, that is differences of habits, attitudes, values
a vivid illustration is contained in the proposal from ottawa recently, for a """"cultural defence"""" against certain breaches of the law - polygamy; the wearing of ceremonial weapons public outrage compelled the minister of justice to make an instant retreat but how did the idea itself ever get through him, his aides, his officials?
the explanation is that the idea of discriminatory treatment is no longer in the least unusual it the intellectual and moral justification for the ontario government employment equity legislation which provides for canadians to be treated differently on the basis of their gender, their color and their race in the case of native peoples it the justification for the demand for state support for segregated religious schools, and that all public schools close on the religious holidays of some unspecified proportion of their students
it is the justification for the recent proposal by the harriet tubman community association, for separate legal treatment for those canadians who have committed minor crimes and who happen to be black
multiculturalism as it has developed could divide us, as it were, at our centre signs exist that a growing number of english- canadians are beginning to think of themselves as just another multicultural group within our mosaic
to a significant degree, the reform party represents a political expression of a retreat by some english-canadians into a kind of ethnic identity the kind of crude backlash against """"diversity"""" that exploded during the recent mid-term elections in the us could happen here
i anticipate not but if english-canadians begin to rewrite the terms of their contract with the canadian nation-state, what left to hold the centre together?
multiculturalism is also hopelessly out of date once, all newcomers underwent a severe cultural shock but the efficiency and comparative cheapness of contemporary systems of transportation and communications, and the ease with which cultural artefacts - foods, clothing, works of artisanship, videos, films, newspapers - can be imported enable all who want to do so to nourish their original culture, rather than merely to preserve it in some kind of household museum, or in a ghetto
the phenomenon now reshaping our society is much more multinationalism than mere multiculturalism that canadian law permits, almost encourages, the retention of two passports is a factor the decisive one is that it is scarcely more difficult now for someone to live simultaneously, in a commercial and a cultural sense, in another country as well as in canada than for that person to commute regularly between canadian cities
in no way do i apply the term multinationalism only to newcomers any canadian visiting eastern europe and the ex-soviet union would be struck by how many canadians live there now many are the second- and third-generation children of immigrants who, whether in croatia or serbia or estonia or ukraine, have found in their """"homeland"""" a self-identifying cause they could not find in the land of their birth
neither is multinationalism in any way unique to the descendants of those who came from countries other than those we once called the mother countries
in his last book before his recent death, the revolt of the elites, the american critic christopher lasch writes angrily about those americans who have, in his term, """"ceased to think of themselves as americans in any important sense"""" these individuals, lasch continues, have turned their back upon america crumbling cities and upon the traditional values of middle america, to retreat into private education, private medicine, private security within walled estates, and to retreat also from america itself into, """"an international culture of work and leisure, business and entertainment""""
an increasing number of canadians, even if they still reside here, have similarly become global expatriates
compared to the phenomen of multinationalism, multiculturalism merely inculcates variations upon a theme its very marginality, though, confirms that if the program were scrapped, few need miss it
humanism vs indentity
discussing multiculturalism is a good entry point into what i believe is a fundamental intellectual and moral debate now going on about what amounts to canada post-modern character
this debate is between those i would call """"humanists"""" (my own creed) and those i would call """"identity politicians"""" i am trying to distinguish between those who regard ethnicity and gender as central to each person attitudes and circumstances, and who therefore see canadians as divided naturally into groups, and those who regard humanity itself, or individuality, as the single essential, common, distinguishing characteristic of us all
the starting point of those who espouse either creed is the same
both accept that canada was structured historically, and to a greater or lesser degree still is, so as to disdavantage - and often also to discriminate against - certain canadians by ethnicity and gender a difference, possibly only a distinction, is that humanists would place greater emphasis on the distorting effects of wealth and class, while identity politicians would emphasize the common discrimination inflicted upon, say, all women regardless of their station
their end point is the same also both seek a canada in which neither sex nor sexual orientation nor color nor race nor culture nor language make any difference to whether a particular person fulfils his or her potential, or fails to do
the entire intellectual and moral debate is taking place in the centre ground this is the source of the arguments about employment equity and the other schemes to discriminate in favor of those once discriminated against - even at the cost of reverse discrimination against others the opposite view holds that to use discrimination as a kind of vaccine against itself is to inject it permanently into our body politic
some of this debate is merely tactical humanists fear that discrimination will provoke a backlash - specifically by white males - that will slow the process of change identity politicians fear that failing to advantage the disadvantaged immediately will multiply their frustration and alienation, making it more difficult for them ever to enter the mainstream
some of the debate is only about perspective identity politicians argue that far too many of the good jobs are still held by white males humanists argue that this is a fading reflection of the canada of decades ago when today vice-presidents were hired as messenger-boys
identity politicians point to the slowness of change, such as that women earnings are only  per cent of those of males humanists point to the rapidity of change; that, for example, young women are gaining jobs far more easily than young men now - their unemployment rate is a full  per cent lower - and that, since  per cent of all university students now are female, they are poised to do better in tomorrow economy
and, as evidence that color itself is no economic barrier, there is the recent finding that vietnamese canadians, most of whom came here a decade ago as unskilled, unilingual refugees, already have a superior employment record to that of native-born canadians, while the many second-generation vietnamese canadian names on honors' lists and deans' lists confirms that they are going to do far better economically than their """"old-canadian"""" equivalents
the debate itself, though, is real, painful and strongly felt by both sides last summer, canadian writers were torn apart over whether a conference of writers of color from which whites were excluded was a necessary technique for overcoming racism, or was itself racist to one side, discrimination can only be ended by discrimination and exclusion only by exclusion, however temporarily and regretfully to the other, to legitimate discrimination and exclusion is to make them permanent disfigurements of our society
a sense of the canadian sensibility
until now, i have painted a portrait of a nation- state being eroded by external forces at the same time as it is being hollowed out by internal ones
what wrong with this portrait isn't that it is inaccurate it wrong because it is out of focus
it time to shift from my thesis to my antithesis and to lighten the gloom clearly, loyalty to the traditional canadian nation- state is declining and will continue to decline but not a scrap of evidence exists of any decline in loyalty to the canadian sensibility most canadians, palpably and overwhelmingly, want to go on being canadian
earlier this year, people in a number of countries were asked which country in the world they judged """"the best country to live in"""" the highest proportion of those who selected their own country were canadians -  per cent ninety per cent of quebecers thought the same way about canada
an almost uncanny difference exists now between the political and social conditions on either side of the border as the mid-term congressional elections confirmed, many americans have arrived nowadays at the point of actually hating each other the level of vitriol, and vengefulness and paranoia in public debate there is extraordinary
no less extraordinary, the contemporary mood of canadians is equable and relaxed, even though our economic conditions are decidely more exigent one illustration of the cross-border difference: by a wide margin, californians have just approved a savagely anti-immigrant proposition; here, the federal government has recently enacted quite minor changes to our immigration system, yet canadians, who only recently told pollsters they feared our immigration program was """"out of control,"""" have almost instantly turned calm about it
personal and stylistic differences between jean chretien and bill clinton account for part of the difference these are only circumstantial differences, though they don't explain why canadians should be so ready, almost anxious to trust their leader, while so many americans should be so eager to mistrust theirs - as they have every leader but ronald reagan during the three decades since john kennedy
our government may be weak, but we still regard it as ours americans want to weaken their government as much as possible because many regard it as an alien, as the enemy
no explanation for these cross-border differences exists but the canadian sensibility we don't really know what it is: some blend of civility, tolerance, a readiness to compromise, an eagerness to engage in dialogue, an appreciation of ambiguity, a fear of extremes, although, as critics have rightly pointed out, a fear also of excellence; plus a certain passivity and smugness but we know that we've got it, and we don't want to give it up
from sensibility to synthesis
post-modern is a pretty slippery phrase in architecture, it doesn't mean much more than buildings that aren't all shaped like cereal boxes in literary terms, it means the doctrine of deconstruction, a conveniently apt description of what happening to our nation-state
so far as nation-states are concerned, political post-modernism means that their normal condition is going to become one of multiple loyalities among their citizens, of individuals possessing multiple identities, and of an ever-shifting balance between the opposed virtues of unity and divisions, of solidarity and segregation
i can think of no nation-state better fitted to cope with these st century challenges than the curious, fractured, radically decentralized, nation-state of canada
provided that we don't fly apart, or just peter out
our traditional nation-state is bound to become ever less relevant to our daily lives many of its activities will become largely symbolic - much of the ottawa apparatus functioning as a kind of enlarged governor-generalcy
end of canada, therefore except that the canadian sensibility is if anything stronger than it has ever been it lacks the assmilative power of the american dream but don't underestimate its seductive power
a relevatory moment for me happened last summer when i sat in on the hearings in toronto of the senate-commons committe on foreign affairs by happenstance, all the presentations were by groups of so- called """"newcomers,"""" a croat group, an iranian one, representatives of the east timor network supported by the canadian-portuguese association
all called on the canadian government to intervene on behalf of democracy and human rights gradually, i realized that these invocations were identical to the demands made so often by canadian aid groups and peace groups and environmental groups, even to their exaggerated estimate of canada international influence
i realized also that these newcomers had picked up the baton of """"helpful fixer"""" first handed to canadians by lester pearson
another relevatory moment happened earlier soon after coming back from seven years in london, i realized that toronto had become at least as polyglot almost as quickly, i noticed a profound trans- atlantic difference couples of different colors walking together along toronto streets, whether as intimates or acquaintances, are common; in london, they are still rare
a moment of pure epiphany about canada contemporary character happened last month the list of finalists for the first annual giller prize for fiction was announced of the five writers judged to be the best in the country, two were women, two were writers of color, one was gay
a more politically correct choice could not be imagined yet less politically correct judges than the novelists alice munro and mordecai richler and english literature professor david staines could not be imagined they sought, in munro phrase, those writers who had """"the truest voice"""" we've created a country, therefore, in which any voice can be heard, provided it speaks the truth
so we aren't a nation instead we've made ourselves into a distinctive national sensibility nor are we without some of the vital inter-connecting sinews of a nation the charter of rights regulates the behavior of all of us, and influences significantly the attitudes of all of us
another poll finds  per cent of all canadians say their commitment is to all of canada rather than """"just the area where you actually live;""""  per cent of quebecers say the same thing
we are cross-hatched over by all kinds of regional, cultural, lingustic and ethnic fault-lines, yet almost all remain committed to the canadian whole why? because, without that whole, none of those differentiated parts could survive, let alone flourish as they now are doing
so my synthesis, my conclusion, is this: for us to make the collective decision that the true mirror-image of tomorrow canada was reflected in those five giller prize finalists and that the alternative, of the exclusionary writing thru' race conference of last summer, would be a regression into a fractured canada that could not survive
to recognize this is to say, that we've already accomplished far more by way of creating a new kind of canada - a post-modern one - than we are yet prepared to give ourselves credit for
who are we? who should we be?
it time for a national debate about the nature of the canadian nation an innovative proposal for how this debate might be framed has been advanced by reform mp ian maclellan he has said canada needs a charter of responsibilities as well as a charter of rights this idea has since been picked up by immigration minister sergio marchi he has said he intends to develop a charter of citizenship that would try to spell out, to the native-born as well as to newcomers, the """"duties and obligations"""" of canadian citizenship
most probably, the idea will prove to be impractical how to define a good canadian? someone who pays their taxes scrupulously? someone who mows their lawn scrupulously? or someone who turns their lawn into a wildflower meadow?
but out of the confusion of a debate about who we are could come a far clearer understanding among all of us of who we should be
nothing should be excluded from that debate rethinking multiculturalism, for example, to cancel the part of it that divides us as opposed to the part - the anti-racist programs - that brings us together casting doubt upon employment equity programs, as, likewise, unnecessary putting a question mark against all of our double barrelled canadians terms like italian canadian, say, may seem impossible to give up because they are so convenient but nothing prevents us from changing our vocabulary, the mutation from chairman to chair as an obvious example
anyway, is """"canadian of italian origin"""" that much more difficult to say than the rest of canada that, according to official decree, has now replaced the traditional term, english canada?
to the phenomenon of multinationalism, i have no solutions limiting canadians to a single passport is probably impractical but we'd be exceedingly naive to pretend that dual-national loyalties do not strain the cohesion of a nation-state
if we did decide to eliminate all these, what we would replace them with is the canadian sensibility we would take the great dare that if all canadians are treated equally, no more, no less, then, being canadians, they would treat each other equally
if a national debate did cause us to make such choices, these would of course fit exactly my own humanist creed
i accept fully discrimination value in specific, time-limited, instances native people cannot do more harm to themselves than we have done to them clearly disadvantaged groups clearly need direct assistance i'm convinced, though, that canadians would support such specific, practical programs if they had no need to fear, as they do today, that these would set precedents for generalized policies of segregation and discrimination
one benefit of a debate about the nature of the canadian nation could be a re-discovery of our history
today, the old canada is treated as irrelevant to contemporary canada
it was the old canada, however racist and sexist and homophobic and the rest of it, that created, as no other society has done, official multiculturalism, also the world most generous immigration and refugee programs, also a charter of rights that is the most liberal and pluralist in the world
if we are defined internationally now by our commitment to keeping the peace for others, we, and the world, owe that concept to a canadian born in the last century, lester pearson it is this continuity between the old canada and canada today that makes me convinced that, because we have a collective past, we will have a collective future
the old canada really is gone, though the national debate should not be about nostalgia the one canada that john diefenbaker once proudly proclaimed is anachronistic as we approach the millennium we are destined to become a global nation, or a microcosm of the entire world - like the finalists of the giller prize
within this canada, multiple loyalities and multiple identities will become as distinctively canadian as once were our air waves, our crown corporations, and the canadian football league
in practical terms, being a global nation in a global economy will give us immense competitive advantages in psychological terms, it will make us unlike any other nation
that infinitely varied whole will lack all self- sustaining form and coherence, though, unless the canadian sensibility is strong enough, is deeply rooted enough in us, to give us a common loyalty, to the whole and to each other i believe our sensibility is strong enough to do this i believe we've already re-invented ourselves into the world first post-modern nation

2308661356,How the price of milk affected Monday's vote in Quebec,Aucun(e) disponible.,"i sometimes see former quebec premier jean charest at my local grocery store, wandering through the isles pushing his cart someone in the family eats muslix for breakfast and i know they buy their steaks from the chain grocery store butcher, rather than at the more expensive atwater market nearby
i have no doubt the charest family can afford to have someone do their shopping for them and that if they wanted to, they could shop at a much better grocery store than mine but waiting in the check-out line with the plebes is extremely savvy politicking over the years, thousands of people have seen charest or his wife, michelle dionne, behaving like average, relatable people (and sure, charest may be out the game now, but it doesn't mean he isn't thinking about a comeback)
being average and relatable is a big sell for canadian voters most of us have a kind of small-town mentality we like unpretentious, friendly feeling politicians who we could see ourselves sitting down and having a beer with that's why i think one of the defining moments in last year's quebec election campaign, which saw the right-leaning nationalist caq elected, was when former premier phillippe couillard suggested during a radio interview that a family of four could eat on $ a week
when couillard made his marie antionette statement, his opponents jumped on the opportunity to call him out of touch for a while, it seemed everyone on the internet was talking about how much groceries cost, and we all agreed they are too expensive
people who don't follow current events, often because they don't have the required background knowledge, were suddenly able to enter into public debates online
if you didn't know who you were going to vote for before that moment, it was very easy to make a decision to vote against someone who had clearly never bought his own groceries
since the caq's election last year, pundits have almost unanimously agreed that the caq's win can be attributed to its dog-whistle politics, which unearthed quebec's latent racism and xenophobia
it has been suggested that the populist trend that has taken off worldwide in the wake of us president donald trump's rise to power found a natural foothold in largely rural quebec except that doesn't explain why maxime bernier's people's party of canada, which made its anti-immigrant feelings well known during the federal election campaign, didn't make a dent here
last october, after the caq government was elected, the religious symbols debate was ramped up again during the campaign, it was barely mentioned and was only brought up once during a televised leaders' debate however, when the caq declared its intention to follow through with its campaign promise, the quebec media and especially the quebec anglo media, twisted themselves into a fury
the proposed religious symbols bill was debated in the media every day for almost a year the rest of canada chimed in the province of quebec and its people were incessantly accused of being ignorant backwater racists in newspapers and online comment sections
quebec's recent history was moulded to suit the dominate narrative that french quebecers were close-minded xenophobes there was barely any mention of the secularism project, which has been ongoing in the province since the s canadians were on a righteous, feel-good witch hunt and the crusade was relentless
by the time this federal election campaign rolled around, quebecers were feeling beat-down and misunderstood yves-françois blanchet, the bloc québécois leader, promised quebecers he would defend them when i watched him speak monday night, surrounded by a sea of people draped in blue flags, it was hard not to feel discouraged
often times the problem is not with other people, but with ourselves we are contrary by nature the more you push people in one direction, the more likely they are to go the opposite route i can't help but feel that we wouldn't be where we are today if only couillard bought his own groceries

free cake, cheap hot dogs, booming cannons    and for the lucky few, the ultimate birthday present a prized certificate of canadian citizenship
on canada day , when the birthday cakes came with  candles, our manner of celebrating was as varied as canada itself
baker toros djerdjian, who left lebanon  years ago and now makes his home in scarborough, knew all about the specialness of the occasion
""""this is a special day,"""" he said as he counted down the seconds to the free canada day birthday cake the one that could feed up to , people at nathan phillips square yesterday
""""you have to have this cake""""
after all, this was no ordinary cake, and no ordinary birthday celebration when an entire country kicks up its heels to celebrate its th birthday, it's special
the -metre by -metre vanilla extravaganza, whipped up by farouk mousa, assistant pastry chef at the sheraton centre toronto hotel across the street, kind of stood in for canada
big country big cake big celebration
""""our country has been voted number  for seven years in a row by the united nations,"""" mayor mel lastman bragged as he welcomed the multicultural multitude to the downtown square
""""our city is great because of the people who live in our city""""
the same goes for canada itself
just ask toronto's marjorie jones, in ottawa to celebrate the occasion with prime minister jean chretien and , other joyous canadians
""""it's a great place a lot of people come here from other parts of the world because of our freedom and opportunities,"""" she said
""""i hope people reflect on that""""
chretien, for one, didn't need convincing as he hosted the mammoth canada day celebration on parliament hill, billed by some as the biggest birthday party in the country yesterday
""""eight times i have done this, and it gets better every time even when we have rain,"""" chretien told the huge crowd, taking a sideways slap at one of this country's most enticing draws its changeable weather
but though the morning showers didn't stop some , people from partying on parliament hill, the high winds felt through much of ontario yesterday forced the cancellation of late-night fireworks in the nation's capital so the evening was instead lit up by stars, in a show featuring fiddler ashley macisaac and rock singer alanis morissette
gov-gen adrienne clarkson looked beyond the hoopla of the day to single out """"neighbours and fellow citizens    the  million canadians who volunteer to make our communities better places to live""""
despite the earlier rain, clarkson arrived in an open landau, protected by two large blue umbrellas
the skies had cleared briefly before the officials arrived, providing a window for the skyhawks six skydivers with canadian flag parachutes to make their jump, trailing red smoke over parliament hill
clarkson paid tribute to people who give of their time and talent to help other canadians
and, perhaps adding her two bits' worth to the patriotism debate du jour how much of our customs and traditions do we actually know? the queen's representative chose an upbeat note
""""every one of us, regardless of our region or background, can sing our national anthem with conviction,"""" she insisted
questions about canada's history, our cultures and our traditions were also uppermost in the minds of  proud new canadians at downsview park in toronto
""""canada is the best country,"""" insisted irena filler, who left her native russia to make a new home in canada and yesterday brandished the ultimate prize her certificate of canadian citizenship after taking the oath with row after row of new canadians
""""the multiculturalism is very important to me,"""" filler said
and so was the test, administered to every new canadian
""""it's not too easy,"""" she admitted
""""but, if people have their goals, they can do that,"""" she added """"i am very proud""""
pride
that also summed up nilufa rauf's approach
rauf, who left her home in sri lanka in search of a safer place to raise her children, says her family found it here
""""it's a great feeling,"""" rauf said after taking the oath of citizenship with her husband marzook and two eldest children
at queen's park, where throngs lined up for a chance at hot dogs selling for a quarter, the smell of gunpowder filled the air as cannons fired off a -gun salute to the country
when they weren't eating, or jamming fingers in their ears in a futile attempt to stave off the echoing blast of the big guns, the thousands who jammed the greensward spent time rocking to the sound of a band performing (how typically canadian) abba songs
perhaps that's why the pot-bellied man in a mr canada costume hauled himself up on stage, where he promptly began dancing next to the two female singers
even though he could barely keep up, it was canadian content!
but perhaps the international flavour imparted by the swedish- inspired rock group was, after all, apropos, since canada day was in a manner of speaking celebrated around the globe
in moscow, the maple leaf was in full glory at a canadian embassy garden party attended by intergovernmental affairs minister stephane dion

the environics labels are cute and kitschy, sometimes a little simplistic, but they help tell an interesting story about the different kinds of people who live in ottawa's different suburbs
kanata
the single biggest group of households here fit under environics' pets & pcs category -- mostly younger, upwardly mobile families who live an active, child-centred lifestyle """"that's definitely us,"""" said mr reynolds
mr reynolds, , is a pharmaceutical representative and his wife, ms larson, also , is an intellectual property lawyer they have a one-year-old boy, mitchell, and an eight-year-old black labrador named sydney (""""typical kanata dog,"""" mr reynolds said)
befitting their title, the pets & pcs crowd like their toys, too the reynolds-larsons own five computers: mr reynolds and his wife each have a pc and a laptop and there is an extra computer around for downloading music and storing data
there's no shortage of gadgets hanging around the house either: blackberrys, cellphones, mp players, palm pilots, pdas, you name it
second-time homeowners, the couple moved to their current single- home -- fully equipped with a backyard pool, hot tub -- three years ago
as president of the kanata-beaverbook community association, mr reynolds has a pretty good idea about the people in his neighborhood -- good enough to know he represents them rather well
""""a lot of people who are younger are not looking to be in an office all the time and, if you have very high-speed connections, you can pretty much go anywhere,"""" he said """"it's faster to reach my wife by e-mail than it is to phone her""""
ironically, they don't have a television set but """"with the internet -- who needs tv?"""" he quickly said
mr reynolds lives an active lifestyle he walks two hours a day with his dog, swims in his pool and windsurfs he would also jog and bike like most of his neighbours if it weren't for his knee problems
he has a life sciences degree from queen's university -- """"a lot of people from queen's over here,"""" he said
he volunteers a lot and often goes to the cottage on weekends
""""the people out here cocoon a lot,"""" he said """"that's the new way of living""""

the most varied of the communities in the study, the two dominating categories here are money and brains and suburban rows, with a dash of nearly-empty-nesters, comfortable middle-aged families and youngish immigrants it's a mix that gives rise to very tolerant, laid-back neighbourhoods

both are college-educated: ms sterne has a psychology degree from queen's and a post-graduate degree from georgian college; mr sterne has an electrical engineering degree from queen's
although they have lived in their single-family home for three years and neither is a visible minority, ms sterne said at least half of the people in her immediate neighbourhood are """"non-wasp,"""" mostly jewish and asian the sternes' accepting -- and interested -- attitude towards other cultures is typical of this diverse suburb, according to environics' data
ms sterne spends a lot of time taking the children to nursery school, going to parks, swimming pools, museums and libraries
""""my life sounds pretty boring,"""" she said with a laugh """"typical mom and kid, dad and kid stuff""""
like most of her neighbours ms sterne frequently visits costco, and often dines at restaurants in westboro or in the glebe
""""we have an average lifestyle but we like it it's not too complicated, but it's exciting,"""" said ms sterne
alta vista
the majority of residents here fall under a category defined by environics as money & brains this group includes mostly upscale educated professionals with sophisticated tastes who tend to support the arts and live politically active lives
marianne cuhaci and her husband, colin mccorriston, both in their early s, have called alta vista home for almost  years they live on bowman road, a small street nestled between featherston and kilborn, a few blocks from grasshopper hill park
their large home is comfortable and well-appointed but not ostentatious and, as is common in this older, community-focused area, they know their neighbours well """"on our street, we look after each other's cats and pick up mail for one another when we go on vacation,"""" mrs cuhaci says
""""there's a real concentration of professionals here -- doctors, teachers, lawyers,"""" says mrs cuhaci, a counsellor who speaks english, french, armenian, and turkish her husband is a practising family lawyer
""""when we came in, it was a lot more affordable we might not be able to move in now""""
she says they have a lot of older neighbours who haven't downsized, and suspects that once that happens, more young families will move in
the couple have two busy, athletic children: jamie, , and anna,  both are in private school -- jamie goes to ashbury and plays hockey, soccer, tennis and golf anna attends the alta vista-area montessori and is a talented figure skater with the minto club
the cuhacis are active in the community with their children's skating and hockey, and mrs cuhaci hosted a night of a thousand dinners soiree to raise money and awareness of the global landmine crisis, which her neighbour, john manley, attended
mrs cuhaci was born and raised in ottawa; her father, edward cuhaci is still a practising architect alta vista residents ranked among the highest believers in control of destiny in environic's polling, and the cuhacis are no different: mrs cuhaci is currently """"redefining"""" her title, and has been exclusively self-employed for three years she does highly specialized counselling and mediation with families going through separation and divorce, and often works together with her husband, whose practice is considered to be quite progressive
hunt club
almost half of residents here fall under a category defined by environics as suburban rows this group includes mostly younger, upper-middle-class families, many of whom are immigrants who live in suburban townhouses with college educations and service sector jobs
hunt club residents frank and catherine yen came to canada in the early s as visa students mrs yen was studying to be a pharmacist, and mr yen was working on his engineering degree
when they bought the plot of land their house now stands on, hunt club was a narrow dirt road running through the forest behind their house now, it's surrounded by homes, schools and parks
""""it's a very typical suburban neighbourhood,"""" says mr yen """"on the weekend, people go outside and do their lawns and gardens and chat""""
the yens live comfortably in a large, high-ceilinged suburban home on a quiet street
like many hunt club residents, they have two good cars, a nice tv and karaoke machine, and they're putting their daughter through university
despite being pleased with how well they've done for themselves in canada, the yens struggle with what they see as excesses and wastefulness that is ingrained in canadian culture, and by extension, in their children
""""i see my children, they live comfortably, but sometimes they do not know how to appreciate it,"""" mrs yen says
now that their two children have moved out of their house, the yens keep to themselves mostly at a street sale last year, a gathering typical of hunt club's social nature, they sold mrs yen's delicious spring rolls to get to know their neighbours better
that's something mrs yen, a drug compliance specialist with health canada, says they have had to work at; achieving a balance of chinese and canadian culture
""""from day one, i maintained that at home we have to speak our own language,"""" mrs yen says even before the birth of their first child, the yens began volunteering at the local chinese school, to establish a routine
mrs yen felt strongly that being around other chinese children and learning the language and culture was important """"i hope it gave them some culture i hope there is a root there,"""" mrs yen says
according to environics, hunt club is a hotspot of ethnic pride the yens are not unusual in making a special effort to preserve their heritage
in fact, for hunt club kids, going to a weekend language school isn't a rarity many elementary schools open classrooms on saturdays for polish, chinese, and arabic lessons, among many others
first-generation children struggling to assimilate can sympathize with each other's issues, and often make friends for life """"it's important for the children to have chinese culture, and for us to learn canadian culture otherwise we will always be isolated to the chinese community,"""" mrs yen says

i then spent much of monday night examining riding-by-riding results, to determine why i was so wrong -- cross-checking against their statistical profiles and the fact leapt out at me: that southern ontario has changed, electorally, beyond recognition over the past decade or so i had failed to take sufficiently seriously observations that i had myself been making
until very recently, i believe, ontario would indeed have thrown the liberals out: first, because of the massive corruption, waste, and arrogance that had been exposed; and second, because they had tried to mask this with a remarkably hateful smear campaign against the opposition the first might have cost them half their seats; the second would have cost them most of the rest instead, today, the second helped them recover from the first
here is the hard truth the province of ontario no longer has a small-c conservative hinterland in riding after riding, and especially through the -plus ridings of its """"golden horseshoe,"""" anchored by toronto -- since confederation, the heart of english- speaking canada -- something has happened akin to what happened in the city of toronto a generation before low birthrates, outward migration, and high immigration from non-traditional sources have transformed the political landscape
where i had expected ontario to largely revert to historic voting patterns, given a superannuated liberal government coming to pieces, and a conservative opposition that had come together, it did not revert in riding after riding that tories used to win, even when they were running an iguana, the grits were now romping home by wide margins
toronto itself was once """"toronto the blue"""" -- and remained, well into the s, """"wasp,"""" and mostly tory, not only by inheritance but also by cultural assimilation of fresh immigrant arrivals the transformation began in the middle of toronto, and worked concentrically outwards

what i mean by this is a kind of multi-ethnic hodgepodge, genuinely lacking a common outlook, or a proprietary sense about the political order -- and therefore easily responsive to the passing suggestions of media and mass culture or to put it another way, the sort of people who can be easily herded, using the cynical methods the liberal party employs; and who, as dalton mcguinty has discovered, quickly forgive and forget when politicians tell them huge lies

while there is still strong support for canada diversity, many canadians want ottawa to spend less on multiculturalism, particularly funding for ethnic festivals and celebrations
these were among the findings of the canadian council of christians and jews' latest survey or ``harmony barometer'' on race and ethnic relations in canada
``while this might seem like a rejection of multiculturalism on the surface, we don't believe so,'' said council president ned goodman after the survey was released yesterday
``canadians appreciate the cultural richness diversity brings    but they want it with limits,'' goodman said
it means that while two-thirds of the respondents agreed that a multicultural society is one of the positive ingredients in canada,  per cent feel that the values of the canadian majority should take precedence
seventy-seven per cent also said ethnic minorities should try to adapt to a canadian way of life, rather than holding on to their cultural differences
but the survey didn't define what it considered to be the ``value system'' or the ``way of life'' of the majority and that is part of the poll weakness, said karen mock, national director of the league for human rights of b'nai brith canada
michael sullivan of decima research, which conducted the survey, said canadians seem to be yearning to move away from the traditional notion of the canadian mosaic toward an american-style melting pot
and many canadians seem to want to see a change in government multiculturalism policies
forty-five per cent want to see ottawa decrease the current $ million it spends on multiculturalism, while  per cent believe the level of spending should remain the same
the majority -  per cent - support policies that encourage equal access to jobs, regardless of ethnic or racial background, and  per cent support funding to help new immigrants integrate but only one in five respondents thinks taxpayers should help fund events that celebrate different cultures
``the feeling is you can have your festivals, but don't ask the rest of us canadians to pay for it,'' goodman said
lennox farrell, chairperson of the caribbean cultural committee which organizes caribana, said it is short-sighted to call for the chopping of funding to ethnic festivals
events like caribana have helped to put metro toronto on the map as a destination for tourists and pump millions of dollars into the region economy, he said
there was an even split on the issue of immigration policy forty-six per cent of those surveyed believed that too many people of different races and cultures are being allowed into canada and an equal percentage felt there was a good balance of people from various backgrounds coming into canada
the national survey, conducted for the council in february, used telephone interviews with , people and is considered accurate within  percentage points,  times out of

1722693504,Syrians die to reach countries where citizens are free to vote,"On the eve of Monday's federal election, anyone who questions the point (or the power) of the ballot box should ask a Syrian refugee how regime change works.","  regime change doesn't happen on its own
if you want to throw the bums out, you can't just sit it out you have to vote them out
and if you want to keep the opposition parties out of power, you have the power to vote against them
on the eve of monday's federal election, anyone who questions the point (or the power) of the ballot box should ask a syrian refugee how regime change works and doesn't work
remember them? fleeing civil war, syrians played a fleeting cameo role early on in the campaign, prompting canadians to ask of their leaders:
why couldn't more refugees come here?
which raises another question for all of us:
why are refugees dying, literally, to come here?
the answer, in a word, is democracy
in syria, regime change is a non-starter, because it ends badly in canada - a nation founded on the precepts of peace, order and good government - bad governments can be changed in a peaceful and orderly way
on election day
no guns no bombs no incitement - at least not much, if you discount conservative demonization of minorities within minorities
in canada, all it takes is the right to vote
well, not quite while every citizen has the right to vote - and a responsibility to democracy - fewer of us do, election after election
there are countless reasons for thinking your vote doesn't count - politics leaves you disengaged, disinterested, disaffected, disbelieving or disgusted - but they are not reason enough not exercising that right is a wrong, because a vote is a terrible thing to waste
just ask a syrian
before writing this political column, i reported from countries where people couldn't vote or where their votes didn't count today, when i hear canadians complain that politicians are all the same, that proportional representation is the only true way, or that the election result is preordained, i wish they could experience just one campaign in a fledgling democracy or faltering dictatorship
canada is no backwater, yet it is going backwards in terms of turnouts
voting in every election is an obligation of citizenship, but monday's vote cries out for democratic engagement more than most
this time, there is a clear choice between the conservatives and the two opposition parties on how, and how much, government delivers essential social programs - child care, health care, pharmacare, pensions
for example, if you believe the current cpp (which pays out less than half of us social security) should be expanded on a pay-as-you-go basis, then you should vote liberal or ndp if you believe the conservative claim - disputed by virtually every economist - that pension premiums are a confiscatory """"tax,"""" retained by government and never ever repaid with accrual upon retirement - then by all means vote for the supposedly anti-tax (but in reality anti-cpp) tories
hey, it's a democracy
if you dislike the niqab, but disagree that prime ministers should pick on veiled immigrant women, then vote for one of the opposition parties
if you believe the state should use its full powers of coercion to unveil women against their will and keep them at the margins of society, then vote conservative, please
after all, it's a free country (unless you want to wear a niqab)
if you want to throw the bums out, but live in a riding where the liberals and new democrats split the vote - allowing the conservatives to squeak in with a bare plurality every time - then choose the opposition candidate with the best prospects strategic voting is no guarantee of victory, but apathy is always defeatist
even if your candidate has no chance, a ballot is never wasted the seat count isn't the only number that counts, especially not in a minority parliament where rival parties joust for legitimacy: popular vote percentages are often cited as a factor when trying to interpret public sentiment, as in the  decision to allow the opposition liberals to form a government with ndp support in ontario
don't take democracy for granted as we learned in mid-campaign, syrian refugees would do anything to live in a country where they are free to vote and live free from discrimination
if you want regime change in the middle east, it takes a village if you want a change of government in canada, it takes a voter
you can throw the bums out or you can throw your hands up
your vote your choice

Serbs behaved with inexcusable cruelty in Kosovo, but it sheer historical ignorance to see Kosovo in terms of Nazi-type persecution.","  editor note: george jonas column appears fridays
i'm no great fan of the writer salman rushdie i will defend him against the ayatollah khomeini, i suppose, but that just about all
nevertheless, i can't disagree with him when he says, as he did in the globe and mail last week, that """"mr blair ideal kosovo is a dream""""
true enough british prime minister tony blair ideal kosovo -- some multicultural elysium, where serb and albanian kosovars, miraculously reconciled by nato cruise missiles, live happily side by side -- is indeed a dream
more accurately, it a delusion, shared by the stubborn innocents of the boomer generation, people whose consciousness was shaped by the hallucinogens and chimeras of the s, from us president bill clinton to canadian prime minister jean chretien and most of his cabinet
rushdie says serb massacres have created an unquenchable thirst for vengeance in returning albanians he quotes reliable sources who say that """"there are few serbs left in kosovo and it is probably impossible to protect them""""
he concludes that """"mr blair and his colleagues should now support the construction of the free, ethnically albanian entity that seems like a historical inevitability""""
maybe so, but i can't help wondering: has an """"ethnically albanian entity"""" become a """"historical inevitability"""" only this month, when rushdie discovered it?
or did it perhaps become a historical inevitability a little earlier -- say, when  nations in the north atlantic treaty organization, the world strongest military alliance, decided to wage war on its behalf?
was it a total surprise that at the end of the conflict there was no multicultural kosovo?
that the postwar vista revealed only nato erstwhile liberals presiding over the ethnic cleansing of serb grandmothers?
who (save the current leaders of the west) could not have predicted that the draft dodgers' and war protesters' war, if successful, would result in what rushdie now delicately describes as an """"ethnically albanian entity""""?
people who opposed nato intervention may have included """"left- leaning bien-pensants,"""" as rushdie suggests, but also people like me (a right-leaning bien-pensant, perhaps?) who saw the problem in somewhat simpler terms
inexcusable cruelty
i believed that in a conflict involving two ethnic groups' desire for mastery over a region, as in kosovo, a third party has no business -- none, that is, unless it wishes to support one side over the other
i couldn't see why it would be in the west interest to support greater albania any more than greater serbia what more, it seemed to me that the two sides were far more likely to reach a compromise knowing that they were strictly on their own
serbs behaved with inexcusable cruelty in kosovo, but it sheer historical ignorance to see kosovo in terms of nazi-type persecution
raising the spectre of the holocaust has been completely misleading in this context
jews who were excluded, expropriated, deported and ultimately murdered in nazi-occupied europe didn't contest an inch of any other nation soil
most jews didn't even look for a separate identity, let alone autonomy or independence
jews were the victims of a lunatic racial hatred the two ethnic groups in kosovo are the victims of their own resolve to set up exclusive rule over the same piece of land
it was self-evident to most people, except the greying flower- children who comprise the west current power elite, that there could be no genuine reconciliation or voluntary power-sharing between the two sides in kosovo, except maybe in some distant future
melting pots and cultural mosaics may be ideal for american- style immigrant societies, but, in regions of ethnic nation-states, trying to impose multicultural models is sheer obtuse arrogance
create more suffering
that at best at worst, such an attempt can create more suffering than the ethnic conflict itself as it no doubt did in kosovo, for both sides
there no gainsaying rushdie blair dream of multiethnic kosovo has become a nightmare what else?
this week the national post carried a picture of two serb widows, jelica milanoc and jelica cimborovic, both in their s the women sit grimly on their balconies in the kosovo town of podujevo, with a british trooper guarding them
even kindly albanian neighbours who do their shopping (they don't venture on the streets) urge them to leave
expelling old ladies hasn't stopped in kosovo it now continues under nato colours, including canada
maybe we can't prevent ethnic cleansing in the world, but we might have avoided conducting it under our own flag

last month he was one of premier robert bourassa's prestige candidates in the quebec election campaign, brought in to show that, despite their turnaround on language, quebec liberals were the only provincial party that could attract top talent from non-francophones
cosgrove, , who said he was asked to build a bridge between english- and french-canadians in quebec, ran in westmount, a safe provincial liberal seat
but on sept , for the first time in  years, westmount did not vote liberal
instead, the upper-class suburb built on the western slopes of the city's mount royal, elected lawyer richard holden of the new equality party -- formed to promote civil rights and protest a perceived liberal drift toward quebec nationalism -- by  votes
so last week, cosgrove sat in a friend's office, signing thank-you notes to supporters, analysing what went wrong and thinking about what to do next

cosgrove sees mistakes on two levels
one was the simple mechanics of the campaign
he should not have agreed, within hours of deciding to run, to attend a news conference for prestige candidates his lack of knowledge then of details of legislation dogged him for the rest of the campaign
and he thinks english-speaking candidates, who all disagreed with bourassa's decision to ban english on outdoor signs, erred when they invited the premier to a news conference on promises of interest to anglo voters the premier's presence distracted reporters from the candidates
""""but the big thing,"""" cosgrove said, """"is that nobody understood the real gap between english-speaking people and the government

his biggest revelation came during door-to-door campaigning
he talked to the rich of upper westmount, the french-canadian bourgeoisie and anglo yuppies farther down the hill, and the immigrants and working-class poor on the other side of the mountain -- and learned there is a wide gap between reality and current political thinking on many subjects
a political party, he said, should put people in touch with those who govern them

like newlyweds vineet mrug and kushbu mistry, who relocated to calgary from their hometown of toronto last year, some residents of the gta and other hot ontario markets are moving to alberta for what they believe is their last opportunity to own an affordable piece of real estate in a large canadian city
""""we entertained the idea (of staying in toronto), but it was very short-lived, just because of the sheer price of homes,"""" said mrug, adding he and his wife made the move with the intention of starting a family soon
mrug and mistry ultimately purchased a -square metre home with a walkout basement and a large backyard in calgary's northwest neighbourhood of valley ridge """"we got three times the amount of house for the same amount of money,"""" mrug said
mrug and mistry's experience is not unique a quick perusal of housing-related forums on online mediums like reddit turns up dozens of recent inquiries from gta residents asking about weather, commute times and popular neighbourhoods in alberta cities, especially calgary
realtors in the western province are also buzzing with anecdotes about what they say is an unusually high number of inquiries from ontario
those stories appear to be backed up by statistics canada data, which says alberta led the country in interprovincial migration in the fourth quarter of , for the first time since  on a net basis, the majority of alberta's new interprovincial migrants in the fourth quarter came from ontario
""""we're starting to see that migration based on affordability,"""" said don kottick, president and chief executive of sotheby's international realty canada """"i think we're seeing some of this driven by the old fomo, the fear of missing out people are going to look where you can still afford a house""""
the benchmark price for detached homes in calgary rose to $, in march, which is over $, higher than december levels and  per cent higher than levels recorded last year many homes are receiving multiple offers and selling over the asking price
on the higher end of the market, the uptick in activity is even more dramatic detached and attached home sales in the $ million-plus price category in calgary rose  per cent and  per cent year-over-year respectively, according to sotheby's

canada's housing affordability crisis has coincided with alberta's recovery from years of recession due to depressed oil prices, which may be another reason eastern canadians are once again looking west

A civic-minded person who has served on many community boards, Pinkus acknowledges that his historic ties to the Kiever also keep him involved. His parents, Isadore and Malkah, were founding members. In this regard, the Minsk appears to be a poor cousin to the Kiever, a synagogue of the same vintage with a similar style sanctuary. They both have large central domes.

on this saturday morning, a dozen men draped in tallesim (prayer shawls) mill around the sanctuary central bimah or stage, taking turns leading the prayers the melodic singing of a guest cantor is hardly audible above a chorus of male voices chanting in varying keys and speeds (a handful of women participate but, in keeping with orthodox law, they sit separately from the men)
the markham was one of dozens of small orthodox congregations that proliferated in the downtown jewish neighbourhoods a  edition of the toronto jewish directory, at the ontario jewish archives of uja federation of greater toronto, lists about  downtown synagogues after the population shifted north along the bathurst st corridor in the s, almost all these synagogues disappeared or relocated
today, the markham shul, along with the anshei minsk and the kiever congregation, two synagogues in kensington market, are the only historic orthodox congregations remaining downtown and while the demographic fallout has taken a toll, the synagogues have rebounded, not to their former glory, but with small but loyal congregations propelling them on
university of toronto professor harold troper, co-author of the  book none is too many canada and the jews of europe -, uses the word """"anomaly"""" to explain the continued existence of these synagogues """"it a small miracle that these places have survived""""
he believes they are partly sustained by a continuing presence of jews living south of st clair - some , according to the  canadian census but judging by the small size of the core congregations,  to  people on average, support from jews downtown is limited, which is not surprising, says troper """"this group is a more unaffiliated community than you'd find elsewhere (in the gta)""""
he notes that these old congregations are partly supported by people with historical affiliations, """"people who insist that a synagogue be kept alive in respect for the memory of an earlier generation""""
this certainly holds true for the markham and kiever congregations as dr joe greenberg, who refers to himself as """"the custodian of the shaarei tzedec,"""" puts it """"the preservation of the shul is my way of honouring my parents and their generation for the hardships they endured as immigrants all our parents wanted was to give their children a better life they gave everything to our generation without ever complaining""""
greenberg, , has made the preservation of the markham, his parents' synagogue, a personal mission
similarly, retired engineer david pinkus, , president of the kiever, has been the driving force behind the -year old congregation for  years he oversees weekly services, fundraising and the ongoing renovations a civic-minded person who has served on many community boards, pinkus acknowledges that his historic ties to the kiever also keep him involved his parents, isadore and malkah, were founding members
the beth israel anshei minsk or minsker shul, a landmark on st andrews street for  years, has followed a different course, however the -year-old congregation has little connection to the founding families or with older members affiliated with the shul in the past, says rabbi shmuel spero, spiritual leader for the past  years
the minsker, the only one of the three congregations with a full- time rabbi and daily services, receives financial support from annual dues (there are about  members), high holy day ticket sales and private donations, explains the rabbi
aj glasser, a congregant with a -year association, estimates that between  to  regulars attend the minsk on saturday mornings he says the personal charisma of the rabbi appeals to the many young members, students and young adults living downtown """"they come because of rabbi spero he a very inspirational and an exceptionally caring person""""
the minsk made headlines four years ago when it was vandalized by a fire that destroyed the second floor library police categorized the incident as an anti-semitic act or hate crime although much of the damage from the fire has been repaired, it is evident from the plywood covered stained glass windows and plastic patched ceilings that the building needs upgrading
in this regard, the minsk appears to be a poor cousin to the kiever, a synagogue of the same vintage with a similar style sanctuary they both have large central domes unlike the minsk, however, the kiever has undergone major restoration work the polished carved wood furnishings of the sanctuary gleam as do the white ceramic floors of the newly renovated social hall
the kiever, a multi-domed structure facing bellevue square park, was designated a historic site in  according to pinkus - he been on the board for more than  years - attendance dropped so low, the synagogue was put up for sale at the end of the 's however, purchase offers were meagre, so the building was taken off the market
in the mid-'s, ontario jewish archives approached the synagogue board about restoring the building and preserving it as a heritage site
stephen speisman, former director of the ontario jewish archives, along with the late sol edell, spearheaded the restoration project by procuring a large wintario grant in , as well as additional money from the community
""""they put their heart and souls into the project,"""" recalls pinkus
he stresses that the official renovation, completed in , was only the beginning of the restoration he points out that the board has raised substantial funds for expensive infrastructure projects that have included upgrades of the all the utilities, repair of the exterior domes and replacement of the heating systems
""""there have been a myriad of expensive projects we've just redone the basement and we're about to augment the air- conditioning,"""" he says
open for holidays and saturday morning services, the kiever is also used for weddings and bar mitzvahs
dr warren rubenstein, a regular at the kiever for seven years, says he discovered the place by happenstance when he attended a bar mitzvah there
""""i didn't know it existed even though i grew up in toronto,"""" he says
""""i was so struck by the shul historic and magnificent interior architecture, i immediately fell in love with the place it was not only the interior, but the history of the place that spoke to me""""
he among a core group of  to  worshippers who attend saturday morning services, led by pinchas gutter, the honourary cantor
""""i'm not orthodox,"""" says rubenstein """"the vast majority of people there are not orthodox the tradition and spirituality of the place attracts us there""""
another regular, dr benjie cooperband, now assists pinkus with administrative tasks like collecting membership dues and booking bar mitzvahs, an important revenue source
""""i'm there to make sure that there some continuity once dave (pinkus) decides to hang up his hat,"""" he says
with an eye to the future, pinkus recently hired martin or menashe solomon to fill the newly created position of cantor/ outreach worker solomon is responsible for running music and educational programs to attract new members
to that end, solomon, the former spiritual leader of the now defunct riverdale shul, envisions an expansion of services to meet the needs of young families, which would include greater participation for women and children
""""there a downtown (hebrew) day school growing rapidly,"""" he says """"people are moving back to the old (jewish) neighbourhoods these are the families we want to serve""""
he believes the kiever inviting atmosphere has wide appeal, which, in fact, was what drew him there, and others from riverdale who followed him
""""the riverdale shul was a very welcoming community,"""" says solomon, """"but we could no longer afford to rent a space and here was the kiever, an incredibly beautiful synagogue, very much in need of members they welcomed us with open arms""""
the inviting and friendly atmosphere is very much part of the quaint charm of the markham shul, says paul appleby, a -year regular, who counts himself among a core group of worshippers made up of  to  men and five to  women
""""people who come are at different levels of observance,"""" says appleby """"it a very welcoming place""""
he credits sheldon or sholom lagner, the cantor for  years and the de facto spiritual leader, with fostering this ambiance
""""sholom lagner is the spiritual glue he sets a tone of tolerance and openness,"""" appleby says """"his quiet authority is based on his knowledge and a way of practice that non-judgmental""""
lagner donates his services as does another key contributor, building contractor jeff phillips, a -year veteran of the shul
""""jeff is fantastic,"""" says greenberg """"he performs the duties of the sexton he looks after the synagogue like gold he prepares all the meals i don't know what we would do without him
""""there a generosity and sweetness about our shul that unique that the way it always been""""
by all accounts, greenberg own generosity and dedication, has been pivotal to the survival of the markham
a local family physician, greenberg did what was unusual for his generation he stayed in the old neighbourhood and raised his four children there his office, a fixture in the south annex for  years, is around the corner from the synagogue
the place was virtually bankrupt when he took over the presidency in the mid-'s, he explains
""""we held a meeting to discuss selling the building my brother mutt said, 'when i want to go to synagogue, i want it to be there' so i said, 'okay, if that what you want, that the way it is going to be'
""""he been an incredibly generous benefactor and our synagogue has benefited tremendously from his generosity we were able to bring the place back to life""""
greenberg and his son, dr david greenberg, the vice-president of the synagogue, raise most of the annual revenue through the sale of high holy day tickets and private donations
""""david has been instrumental in carrying on the operation of the shul he taken on increasing responsibility in the affairs of the shul""""
the younger greenberg, , willingly accepts the torch """"whatever the challenges there are, it an honour to be able to do it
""""i've been going to the shul since i was  years old i had my bar mitzvah there because of my relationship to the synagogue and my dad, it puts me in a unique historical and family position to do this i take it as an honour and an obligation""""

While elections are a cornerstone of democracy, they are not the best forum for engaging citizens in genuine dialogue. The political arena is a low-trust, high-stakes environment that lends itself more to sparring sessions and spin than real dialogues. Participants in town halls, round tables and other forums for engaging citizens are likely to question whether candidates are after their views or their votes.

Online engagement, though still in its early days, offers great promise, once we get beyond the stage of web-based surveys and move into more truly interactive forms of web-based dialogue. This will be an important supplement to, but never a replacement for, engaging stakeholders face-to-face and in real time.","those who lament the """"democratic deficit"""" have little reason for optimism in this election while elections are a cornerstone of democracy, they are not the best forum for engaging citizens in genuine dialogue the political arena is a low-trust, high-stakes environment that lends itself more to sparring sessions and spin than real dialogues participants in town halls, round tables and other forums for engaging citizens are likely to question whether candidates are after their views or their votes
with voter apathy and cynicism at an all-time high, people are seeking and finding other ways to participate in democratic processes
last november, prime minister paul martin and former us president bill clinton agreed that democracy was a messy business and not the best vehicle for delivering aid; that was better left to private, non-profit organizations
while this may say a lot about ngos, it says little for parliamentary democracy the political process could learn a good deal about genuine citizen engagement from the third sector
in my public life, including my current position as chair of the ontario trillium foundation, i have come to appreciate the growing importance of citizen engagement last summer, the ontario trillium foundation, one of canada's largest granting foundations, launched a series of community conversations throughout ontario
we distribute $ million in funding to more than , not-for- profit and volunteer organizations across the province every year our community conversations were designed to spark discussion and were premised on the notion that genuine dialogue and deliberation are crucial to building better organizations, communities and democracies we learned a lot about effective public engagement
you get better public policy when you include the public the prevailing wisdom in the 's and 's was that governments could outsource anything except policy-making how thinking and practice have changed the public has taken its rightful place as a contributor to and participant in the policy-making process
move from consultation to conversation when you engage people in a conversation, you better be ready to listen, to hear things you may not agree with, and to respond governments and agencies such as ours must move beyond old-style consultations - often no more than a series of presentations to the powers-that-be - and enter into two- way conversations
create an environment of trust the best conversations, whether between two people or among a hundred, happen in an atmosphere of trust and respect participants will be more forthcoming in a forum where they feel the dialogue is genuine and where views can be freely exchanged
throw the doors wide open if you hand-pick your participants or set too many limits around who can participate, you will undermine the range and quality of discussion the more exclusive the session, the less you will learn
i recall a town hall meeting not long ago where one young woman, an immigrant from eastern europe, objected to the session being a """"citizen dialogue"""" she noted that, though not a canadian citizen, she was nevertheless a community member who had a legitimate voice in this discussion she raised a good point only citizens can vote, but all community members can participate in town halls or public forums
public participation should offer the opportunity to do more than register people's views it must also give people the satisfaction of being heard and feeling that their views matter one of the oft- cited limitations of our first-past-the-post electoral system is that it leaves many voters feeling that any ballot cast for an unsuccessful candidate is a vote wasted this is one explanation, but certainly no excuse, for poor voter turnout rates in canada and the record low of  per cent in the  federal general election - the lowest since  certainly changing how we vote would help, but so would building the credibility of the democratic process
offer alternative opportunities for engagement we knew that not everyone could attend our meetings so we extended our conversations by connecting with people online when you engage in a dialogue with the public, you have an opportunity but also an obligation to talk to people when and where it is convenient for them online engagement, though still in its early days, offers great promise, once we get beyond the stage of web-based surveys and move into more truly interactive forms of web-based dialogue this will be an important supplement to, but never a replacement for, engaging stakeholders face-to-face and in real time
keep the conversation going and make it matter it's not enough to have a good conversation if it leads to nothing share what people tell you and show them how it will make a difference
the ontario trillium foundation is using what we heard in our community conversations to improve our grant-making practices so that we are even more responsive to the different and always changing needs of the communities our grants are designed to support
the political process could also benefit from creating more effective forums for engaging the electorate we cannot restore faith in our political system without convincing people that we value their views as much as their votes
so let's really talk people are willing and able to engage in real conversations on issues that matter to them most let's give them that opportunity

1955081606,"'To demand better, to dream bigger':   Singh's victory brings diversity, heralds end of baby boomers' reign in Canadian politics",Aucun(e) disponible.,"with the selection of jagmeet singh as ndp leader, the  federal leadership lineup is now complete it will be strikingly different from that on offer only two years ago on not one but two significant scores it will also be more representative of st-century canada
for the first time, there will be someone drawn from the ranks of canada's visible minorities on the leaders podium
and for the first time in the living memory of most voters, there will not be a baby boomer vying to become prime minister on behalf of one of the three main parties
singh is , the same age as conservative leader andrew scheer at , justin trudeau is the oldest of the three main party leaders
the long reign of the generation that dominated canada's life for the past decades has drawn to an end
there is little that is revolutionary about either change one in five canadians hails from a visible minority and that proportion will grow over the next decade
in , the millennials will overtake the baby boomers to become the largest cohort of canadian voters they already pulled their weight in the last election by voting in greater numbers and by favouring the liberals, they were instrumental in giving trudeau a governing majority
in the run-up to the leadership vote, singh signed up the most new members but he would not have won on the first ballot without the tacit or active support of part of the ndp base with almost  per cent of the vote, he finished more than  points ahead of runner-up charlie angus
singh did draw much support from the south asian community and he probably had an easier time getting his vote out because it was more concentrated than that of his rivals
but without his supporters the ndp might have been hard pressed to fill even the mid-sized toronto hotel room it had chosen to hold sunday's leadership event and the audience would certainly have been less diverse
it is that diversity that will likely stick in the minds of the strategists of the other parties - in particular the liberals the ndp will still come at them from the left, but it will offer multicultural canada the added attraction of bringing a long-awaited element of diversity at the head of the federal table
singh could not be more different from thomas mulcair - the leader he succeeds - but they have in common that they are power-driven political figures they both play to win
will singh's victory further damage the fragile bridge between the ndp and quebec? to that question there is no definitive answer but then it is not as if any of the also-rans had emerged as much of a quebec favourite one way or the other, singh will have an impact in the province
he does not hold a seat in the house of commons and he is unfamiliar with federal politics the first matters less than the second part of mulcair's underestimated legacy is a caucus that is more than up to the task of holding the parliamentary fort - in french and in english
singh already has a parliamentary leader at his disposal in the shape of nathan cullen, the popular british columbia mp and former leadership contender who supported singh's bid
the issues will be different, or at least the angle on them will take some getting used to but some of the dynamics singh encountered as a member of the ontario legislature will be familiar that starts with a progressive electorate whose first concern is to keep the conservatives - be they of the mike harris or the stephen harper brand - out of power
it also includes an incumbent who is attractive or at least not as offensive as the conservative alternative to many left-leaning voters on that score, scheer has to be hoping that singh will give trudeau more of a run for his money, for it usually takes a divided progressive vote for the conservatives to win power
a word in closing: some ndp strategists had hoped it would take one more ballot to elect a leader, if only to keep the media spotlight on the attention-starved party a little while longer
but for better or for worse for the new democrats, singh's arrival on the federal scene is a story that will be more compelling for far longer than a week of leadership machinations

there had been a steady flow of these street-level entrepreneurs, from ottawa and elsewhere, who left their hometowns to deal drugs in alberta when the economy there was red-hot
but as the overall economy has worsened, so, too, have gang members' fortunes: now there is less money to be made and increased competition for the business that remains
additionally, gangs have seen the murders of their members by presumed rivals and have come under increased police scrutiny since moving to the prairie province
ottawa police staff sgt chris renwick said the result is that there are some very familiar faces back in the nation capital
""""we have seen a slowdown on the people going there and also we're seeing people returning,"""" he told the citizen
in some cases, these street gang members have had to phone police in ottawa to tell them they have returned because of release conditions they must follow, he said
and should police see evidence these street gang members are returning to their old habits in ottawa, investigators will be quick to intervene, staff sgt renwick said
""""we'll be gathering evidence, laying charges and trying to put you out of business,"""" said staff sgt renwick, who joined the gangs and guns unit last month
the citizen reported last year that at least  ottawa street gang members had migrated to alberta in search of better business prospects in 
police said many held connections to the ledbury-banff crips -- the long-established ottawa street gang that has seen three of its members deported from canada for criminal activities in the last year
cathy prowse, a professor, gang expert and former police officer, said it is natural for gang members to go where the money is -- especially when times get tough
""""these guys, they'll go somewhere else, lay low and some of them will even engage in other types of activities,"""" she said
""""they branch out and they go to other things that they think will keep them afloat for the time being,"""" ms prowse added, listing robberies, extortion and protection rackets as examples of activities street gang members might pursue during the current economic downturn

""""the migration of other groups here into western canada is slowing,"""" he said """"but the ones that are here, or the crews or the groups that are here, are trying to strengthen their business processes because they've got a bit of a foothold here and they want to try to keep it""""
in addition to a tougher domestic marketplace, street gangs have also faced economic challenges from a mexican drug war that has pushed up production costs, including the price of importing cocaine, he said
they've suffered credit problems, too: those street gangs that borrowed drugs when money was flowing freely through the oil-rich economy must now pay back their lenders
""""business is different for them right at the moment, because they can't just focus on providing their product,"""" said insp galvin, who is part of the organized crime branch of edmonton police
""""they now have to provide their product, protect their consumer base, keep their people in line, stop from having a hostile takeover occur,"""" he added
insp galvin said the gangs in much of northern alberta -- edmonton, fort mcmurray and grande prairie -- are more likely to be from the toronto area, while those in calgary tend to have stronger ottawa connections
calgary has seen its share of street gang violence involving former ottawa residents, including shootings and other incidents
in the past couple of years, the killings of three ottawa-area men in alberta -- two in calgary and one in edmonton -- have caught the eye of police in both provinces, staff sgt renwick said
this type of violence prompted calgary police to crack down on these street gang members' activities last fall, police announced they had broken up a drug-dealing network that was controlled from ottawa and had been tied to at least four separate shooting incidents
all in all, calgary police laid more than  criminal charges against  individuals and seized  guns, $, worth of illegal drugs and $, in cash from the arrested parties, during their months-long investigation
acting staff sgt gord eiriksson of calgary organized crime operations centre said those police efforts appear to have put the kibosh on their activities for the time being
the raids, he said, """"were very successful in dismantling parts of those gangs and putting some of the key players in jail""""
but he admits that some ottawa street gang members are still present and still dealing drugs, though their involvement in violence appears to have lessened some since the arrests in october

2517186452,Quebec secularism bill ruling doesn't make sense,Aucun(e) disponible.,"for the first time since his government introduced bill , quebec's controversial and abhorrent secularism legislation, i agree with premier françois legault on something
""""i don't understand the decision,"""" he said tuesday of the quebec superior court ruling on a constitutional challenge to the law barring public sector authority figures, such as teachers, police and judges, from wearing religious symbols
in a nutshell, the ruling finds bill  discriminates against muslim women in particular, but upholds it because quebec pre-emptively invoked the notwithstanding clause but it crucially exempts its application to the english school system, recognizing the anglophone community's right to ensure diversity and inclusion in hiring its teachers
""""i don't see the relationship between language and values, including secularism,"""" legault said
neither do i but from here, i part ways with legault
legault, after all, brought in the secularism law that tramples religious minorities'rights, after stoking prejudices about """"the other"""" with dog-whistle politics he's probably fuming the court handed a win to english school boards he often treats the anglophone community as an irritant that at best fails to fall in line, and at worst thwarts his plans
english school boards are """"elated"""" the court recognized their protected status and history of championing diversity and rightly so the anglophone community has been a key ally of religious groups targeted by a government hellbent on instituting state neutrality hopefully, this decision bolsters their coming challenge of bill , abolishing school boards
even if this nod to the rights of english schools can be seen as a silver lining, it's hard to read this judgment as any kind of win: for women, particularly muslim women; for minorities; for fundamental rights; for diversity; for inclusion; and for quebec society
the decision lets bill  trample the rights of muslim, jewish or sikh teachers working in the french-language school system or other public institutions their right to have a religious identity and to express it through articles of faith, such as the hijab, kippah or turban is only recognized if they work for an english school board or win election to the national assembly
what about teachers now working for french-language school boards? they won't be fired, but can't move up the career ladder without removing religious insignia what about aspiring teachers? they simply won't be hired in the francophone system due to their faith what about religious minorities who want to be police officers, prosecutors or judges? they won't be represented in law enforcement or the justice system i guess they can apply to an english school board but why do rights count in anglophone institutions but not francophone ones? the message this ruling sends to the public - with whom bill  is popular, polls have shown - is the majority doesn't have to be tolerant diversity is the domain of minorities alone and need not concern society as a whole
the ruling is a study in contradictions
justice marc-andré blanchard acknowledges legislation claiming to promote equality of the sexes negatively affects """"vulnerable"""" muslim women, first and foremost
he agrees restrictions on religious symbols violate constitutional rights, but accepts that the government shielded the law with the notwithstanding clause
he posits that secularism, bill 's raison d'être, is born of the same philosophical roots as religion, but apparently concludes these two sides of the same coin are irreconcilable
blanchard may be seeking middle ground in a debate that tends to be black and white but all the ruling seems to do is further muddy murky waters
the quebec government has already announced it intends to appeal to defend bill  (and deny english schools any special treatment)
i agree with the decision to appeal, too, but for different reasons the ruling only compounds the sexism, racism, unfairness, injustice and social resentments the secularism law unleashed ahanes@postmediacom",The Sudbury Star,2021-04-23,2021,4,23

for my friends born of immigrants whose skin may be darker than mine, whose traditional dinner may be heavier on rice, curry or pasta, does that mean they cannot take pride in being canadian? by focusing on the colour of someone's skin, the food they eat, or language they speak, we are losing track of what it means to be canadian celebrating diversity cannot be done in half measures to truly celebrate it, we must embrace it there is so much more to be gained by remaining open to cultural diversity and all that it brings to us
it's time to look at the growth of canada as a """"glass half full"""" scenario, rich with diversity, infused with colour, scents and sounds, rather than """"half empty"""" and focused on losing an identity that i don't think we ever had in the first place
kim hall, markham
canada is indeed a wonderful country, but in our current manifestation, i don't think we can be called the best country before that can be true, canada must improve its thought leadership with respect to canadian cultural identity and to the value ascribed to our cultural sector

ottawa - immigration and an unprecedented economic boom in alberta fuelled a population surge in canada that outpaced every other g- industrialized nation from  to , including the united states, reveals statistics canada census data released tuesday
canada's population increased by about  million in the last census period, from a little more than  million in  to about  million in 
the population statistics, the first of several pieces of census data to be released over the next year, illustrate a number of significant trends that have contributed to major shifts in where people live in canada
the overwhelming majority of canada's population can be found in cities, with four out of five people, or more than  per cent of citizens, living in urban areas
canada's urban growth, contained largely to suburban areas on the outskirts of the country's largest cities, """"presents many challenges for metropolitan centres, especially in the areas of transportation, public services and the environment,"""" according to the statistics canada report
at a time when declining birth rates are plaguing many developed countries, canada experienced an overall population rise of  per cent, due in major part to an influx of immigrants it marks the first time since  the population increased faster than the previous census period, which was four per cent
""""in most of the industrialized countries, the trend in population growth is toward a decline,"""" said laurent martel, senior population analyst at statistics canada """"(canada) is the smallest population, but it's the fastest growing population""""
ontario and alberta experienced the largest population increases in canada, accounting for two-thirds of the country's total growth during the census period nearly all of the remaining population growth occurred in british columbia and quebec
alberta had the country's highest population growth at  per cent, outpacing its own growth of  per cent in the previous five- year period
jasmine wang is one of the many new immigrants to canada who decided to settle in alberta after hearing about the abundance of jobs and opportunities
""""it's mainly because of the economy here, it's booming, so i think maybe i will get more working opportunities here,"""" said wang """"i have been working for six months already actually, i got a job very fast, right after i came here""""
wang arrived in calgary from china about a year ago with her husband and son and was able to find full-time work in her field of freight exports within a few months
international migration accounted for two-thirds of canada's population growth in the last census period that's in stark comparison to the us, where  per cent of the growth was due to a natural increase from the number of births exceeding the number of deaths the us had the second highest population growth of any g-  country in the last census period
the census shows high immigration levels were responsible for much of ontario's  per cent population increase half of canada's growth rate occurred in ontario during the census period
the only provinces to experience a population decrease during the census period were saskatchewan and newfoundland and labrador the population of all four atlantic provinces remained """"virtually unchanged"""" since , at about  million, according to statistics canada
although the statistics show much of canada's population growth is contained to cities, a significant proportion of the increases actually occurred in suburban areas or """"edge cities"""" surrounding the country's largest cities for instance, the population of brampton, located in the greater toronto area, grew by  per cent in the census period, compared to the national average of  per cent
barrie's population grew  per cent in the last census period meanwhile, toronto itself only grew  per cent in the census period
in fact, nine of canada's  cities with the largest populations are on the fringes of toronto, montreal, or vancouver, and include mississauga, laval and surrey
highlights
- quebec's population rose  per cent, three times faster than the previous five-year period this marked the second-fastest growth rate since the end of the baby boom in the s an increase in the number of immigrants was responsible for much of the province's growth
- barrie, a hub for commuters north of toronto, had the fastest growth of any canadian city, followed by calgary
- the population of calgary and edmonton exceeded one million for the first time, bringing the total number of canadian cities with populations more than one million to six
- the population decrease in newfoundland and labrador of  per cent was far less than the seven per cent drop recorded between  and 
- manitoba grew  per cent, its fastest rate since 
- population growth in british columbia was nearly identical to the  national average the province's population surpassed four million residents during the census period
- the population of the three territories surpassed , for the first time during the last census period, compared to , during the previous five-year period
- close to half of respondents declined to have their information made publicly available in  years

the new york world trade centre bombing opens a brutal chapter in terror warfare and carries a stern message for canadians
no longer are civilian targets in north america off limits in the worldwide terror offensive
today, canadians must come to terms with a threat which is more severe - and perhaps imminent - than most realize
canada is facing two growing terrorist dangers - what intelligence experts call the domestic and homeland threats
domestic terrorism involves violence by canadians against canadians born of disparity and alienation, the domestic threat will increasingly take the form of single-issue terrorism aimed at influencing the national agenda this will reflect sometimes surprising efforts to harness violence for social and ideological ends
terrorism experts expect anti-abortion and ecology-inspired violence - eco-terror - to increase as the health and economic consequences of a failing environment come home
even animal rights extremism will increase, according to an april  report by the canadian security intelligence service (csis) the fbi has already classified related incidents, especially those involving the animal liberation front, as domestic terrorism
aboriginal issues will inspire other single-issue violence native extremists linked to the oka crisis are thought by some security officials to be stockpiling weapons - from heavy machine guns to armor-piercing shells and armored personnel vehicles - for terrorist warfare terror-supporter moammar gadhafi even met pro-warrior mohawk nation office representatives in libya in  to give them $, and the moammar gadhafi human rights award but public sympathy for aboriginal grievances has clouded this as a terrorist issue and prevented timely government intervention
surprising to many, aids terror is a growing risk the federal government estimates there are , hiv/aids cases desperation will drive aggressive civil disobedience campaigns like those staged by the us act up aids guerilla organization such possibilities have already led our federal aids computer database to be specially secured following sabotage attempts on equivalent us centre for disease control facilities in atlanta, ga
and january's highly co-ordinated nazi assault on montreal's jewish sites reminds us of the building race supremacist threat canada's heritage front and the ku klux klan are expanding in response to non-traditional immigration even quebecois, long rejected by the klan, are now welcome to join the kkk's campaigns against minorities counter-violence is expected as minorities react
the homelands threat is especially alarming homelands cases involve immigrants based in canada who use or encourage violence to further causes in their lands of origin while their target is not usually canada, canadians, including other recent immigrants, can be their victims intelligence believes the  air india crash to be a lethal example of a homelands operation involving canadian sikh extremists in anti-india activity
the potential for homelands terror increases as international political and economic instability brings more immigrants from areas of violent factionalism
four decades ago,  per cent of immigrants came from then-peaceful european countries by , that same proportion of canada's , annual arrivals came from african, middle eastern, asian and other regions considered to include trouble spots this past year showed that resentments travel well and high- lighted prospects for homelands violence
last may, for example, a sudanese exile was charged with attacking sudanese strongman hassan al-turabi in ottawa throughout the middle east came calls, mostly unreported in canada, for revenge against canada for permitting the assault related clashes occurred in canadian cities
a security intelligence review committee report attributed an april  attack on iran's ottawa embassy to members of the mujahedin-e-khalq (mek) protesting an iranian air attack on the mek base inside iraq somali immigrants protested the presence of somali human-rights abusers, including an alleged torturer, in canada meanwhile, radio-canada reports concerns among ottawa's , somalis that their children fear schoolmates from opposing somali factions
this january brought a congolese occupation of the zaire high commission in ottawa and the arrest of an irish-born canadian linked to a major ira weapons and technology network supplying everything from us missiles to canadian detonators
technology, transportation and terror are a deadly cocktail terrorists, their weapons and operations can be highly co-ordinated and mobile state-sponsored terrorism expands the possibilities enormously
action is needed weapons are more lethal, thanks to technology and more available, thanks to east bloc disintegration plutonium has been smuggled out of russia, and reports have three soviet nuclear warheads in iran radioactive cobalt, cesium and plutonium are accessible in medical and industrial establishments throughout the world
bioengineering by terrorist-supporting regimes such as syria means that infinitely more dangerous material is available small arms and explosives proliferate, and plastics have made them almost invisible to x-ray and other surveillance equipment
what can be done?
international co-operation is vital the recent geneva conference on disarmament's chemical weapons conventions and international liaison in nuclear proliferation are hopeful signs and interpol and multilateral intelligence liaison are increasingly focusing on arms, technology and money suppliers, the big fish of international terror
where states such as libya are involved, chapter vii of the un chapter authorizing interruption of economic relations should be applied there is no time to lose and such options demand canada's vigorous support
at home, transportation security must be stepped up air india and lockerbie are just the beginning, but technology can help low-pressure chambers are available to enable dogs to sniff explosives sealed in luggage thermal neutron activation should allow us to scan baggage with a high degree of confidence
we are extremely vulnerable to attacks on our utilities, including nuclear ones power failures in winter should focus canadians' minds structures must be developed that can withstand attack this is equally true of computer and communications networks, the achilles heels of technological society we must set up multidisciplinary emergency teams to deal with nuclear and other mass-destructive terror (americans have been running nuclear counter-terror simulations - war games - since at least )
stringent immigration requirements must place onuses on candidates we should not be shy about using deportation where evidence of terrorist involvement exists there is no room for terrorism here or abroad, regardless of the cause new york's tragedy should confirm what specialists have long feared where terrorism is concerned, it is much later than we think

(part two of three)
the fields of canada are the soil of our immigrant history those immigrants left foreign homelands and planted themselves in fresh earth they became a hybrid, adapted to vastness and climate they stayed, and with hope, stubbornness, endurance, and sometimes cruelty, they rewrote a landscape
now there are towns scattered throughout canada that are mere husks, their seeds gone to the city it is the modern flux but these towns are not so much decaying as subsiding, having risen briefly in a world of railroads and kerosene now they are finding new levels and people with new reasons to live there
it is possible for the whole history of some canadian towns to live in one memory in southwestern saskatchewan, near the town of eastend, there is such a place and such a memory the town, or to give it its official designation, """"disorganized hamlet,"""" is called ravenscrag
three families live within the boundaries of ravenscrag three farm families now work the land around the town that was once worked by many the cattle yards here were among the biggest in the prairies, but now the town is so small that, as the locals say, the welcome to and the come again signs are nailed to the same post
the biggest gathering going on in ravenscrag when we were there was among the pigeons on the top of the abandoned pool elevator those too came to an end when the elevator was torn down shortly after we left, the last of the three that once formed the town's southern border much of the town is heading the same way; the bright sunlight and absence of trees make the desertion all too obvious
it is not a sad sight abandoned buildings gain their own beauty in ravenscrag they form the majority, standing among the upstart, freshly painted minority like elders the boards shed their skin of paint, hold their youthful brown for a briefly regained adolescence, then season from brown to grey the curve, the true line of nature, invades their rectangles as the nails let go and the sun warps them like old men's spines much more is happening beneath the surface of this town than you'd suppose if you just drove through
one sunday a month, for example, the small white-board church is as full as it ever was in the heyday of ravenscrag, before highway  went in and cold-shouldered the town by ten kilometres the pump organ inhales and exhales the melodies, pursued by the twenty-two-strong congregation and the visiting anglican minister, ms chapman the parish is scattered now _ but families like the savilles, seated along the front pew, schooled their children here and continue to pray here
the savilles are a fine example of adapting to the subsidence of prairie towns ann and bill saville run a bed and breakfast and sell antiques and cowboy gear from the old north west mounted police post moved onto their farm by the previous owners seventy years ago ann is on a farm debt review board, a position that keeps her busy in blighted saskatchewan she also collects locks of hair of her relatives, which she keeps in a sewing box and calls """"hairlooms"""" her eldest son, david, and his wife still farm
her other son, jim, a schemer, is moving a heritage home from the trans-canada highway to a coulee on saville land it will become a restaurant and farm vacation establishment the house arrived the day we left, having inched its way past roadside kitchen windows and kids with big eyes ann's husband, bill, a craftsman saddle-maker, is away in the states at a heavy horse pull he is one of the few men left in the province who can hitch and drive a team of eight
emmie phillips, whose memory it is that holds almost the whole history of the town, isn't in church today the screen door of the grocery store in eastend, pushed open by grocery filled arms, caught the wind and knocked her flat on her tailbone she is in the eastend rest home, waiting for the doctor to tell her if any of her ninety-year-old bones are broken
before visiting emmie, we spend a few minutes behind a cup of coffee in the focal point of the district _ jack's cafe across the street, the boys in charlie's lunch are rolling dice to see who gets the morning breakfast bill there are skid marks in the dust outside the museum, laid down the night before by some cowboy in a four by four
inside the museum, which started out as a dance hall then did some time as the movie house, there are two rows of wood-and-glass display cases dinosaur skulls and polaroid cameras from the fifties are packed in haphazardly, evidence of life spanning millions of years, crammed metal to bone eastend proudly calls itself the dinosaur capital of saskatchewan; there is an annual dinosaur days festival leaning up against the stage are three pale blue-and-white bandstands, each announcing the eastend rhythm rascals, the local foot-tappers from the thirties and forties
a sign in the museum window says welcome to saskatchewan; a sign below says sorry, we're closed the waitress in jack's cafe has the keys in a box just inside the museum door there is a complete set of look magazines covering the kennedy assassination, twenty-five cents each we buy them and take them with us to emmie phillips
emmie is a rancher she lives just outside ravenscrag in a house built by her then husband-to be for his parents in  on the porch there is a chest, the one she brought with her on the train from chester, nova scotia, in  she was twenty five and called emmilie robinson and she came to be the schoolteacher above the chest are the snowshoes she was advised to bring the school she came to is closed now the teeter-totter in its schoolyard is tipped to one side by an invisible weight
in  the two classrooms were full again for the ravenscrag homecoming a thousand people turned up the mass flushing of the school toilets pumped the well dry, and an abandoned field nearby got some unexpected life poured onto it the hutterites brought buns and emmie donated a sack of potatoes
emmie is tough, the kind of tough that had all ninety-five pounds of her up against a steer's backside last year when cattle prods, in male hands, couldn't get it in the truck fairly soon after she arrived, emmie married aubrey phillips, a welshman the postmistress in ravenscrag, a matchmaker, introduced them aubrey had walked into the area in  to start his first job on a ranch he took the wrong fork at a break in the trail and would have walked clear into montana if a nwmp constable hadn't chanced on him and put him straight
six years after aubrey walked in, the steel tracks of the railway rolled past eastend and on across the prairies a railway station was the seed that started the town growing (a railway engineer named the spot after a montreal mansion he knew of, owned by a shipping magnate the cpr had bought out the mansion is now part of mcgill university) the livery barn went up first, then a lumberyard and a grain elevator the hotel entertained the visiting cattlemen; the town bore the rough with the smooth the stockyards became among the finest in the province
we sat by emmie in the rest-home bed as she hopscotched over the century she piled stone on stone of bygone details and days that still shook in her memory until she had built a house of oral heritage as worthy of preservation as any fine man's mansion and every halfhour or so she would pause, inform us that she really had nothing else to say, then plunge on for another half-hour
most of emmie's life has been defined by the buttes to the north and south of frenchman's creek, the river that bisects her ranch and the sixty head she still keeps on it the cpr changed the course of the river from south of her home to the north of it during the first world war, and it has been trying to get back ever since she has seen the river run dry three times, and camped out more than once on the northern butte when it flooded, taking her geese with it
the buttes define the space, and time has been a line of arrivals and departures the mail arriving on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays at the railway station; radio and then the telephones (until the phone lines went in, the prairies gossiped on barbedwire telephones, sending messages along the fencing); the storms shouting out that rain was coming; the indians passing through on their way to a tribal conference in montana; the wildlife moving in for easy food
orders arrived from the eaton's catalogue, the book club fed the mind, and the bible school truck arrived just in time to prime flagging souls then television came, and soon after that came casual theft and padlocks on the doors and all the while the hired hands would come and go: elis, the metis whose father had harvested the drought on leather knee-pads, and jim from seven persons, alberta, who planted the poplar sapling at the back that is now a mature tree
for every arrival there was a departure: the mail back down the line on alternate days the slates in the schools, that briefly recycled information, and then the school itself then the post office, despite a group of concerned citizens sitting themselves down on the steps and going nowhere unless picked up and moved the eaton's catalogue went, the eyes out of pearson's goose in a hailstorm, and just last year four cows struck by lightning twenty years ago emmie rode her last horse, and lately her eyesight is leaving her and, one by one, the grain elevators by the railway tracks
emmie has no intention of retiring when she mends from this latest minor setback her longevity reminds me of a sheep farmer i knew in england, a man whose first steps were taken on a sheep trail he and his two brothers herded their sheep in the yorkshire dales, until the millionaire whose farm i was working on bought them out and reinstalled them as managers
his leg broken by a ram and healing badly, the sheep farmer was forced to retire it was decided that there should be a retirement party on the main farm we mucked out a barn, made some straw bale bleachers and danced to a slick deejay with a mid-atlantic accent
when the time came for speeches, they gave the sheep farmer a clock, a clock for a man whose only times of reference for sixty years had been dawn and dusk, and asked him to say a few words he was a dour man, and nobody expected any feats of oratory in fact he only said one line """"if i'd known the job were temporary,"""" he said, """"i'd never have taken it""""
here is how the last grain elevator in ravenscrag was retired, two weeks after we left, at the age of sixty-five grain barons far away signed the warrant the last trucks brought the last grain and filled the bins for the last time, red wheat from a good year kissing the tops of the cedar-sided hoppers the trains rolled into the siding with empty hoppers and out with them full, bleeding off the crop
then the railway men came and tore out the siding and on a sad, sunny day in the year of the drought, the caterpillar tractors with front-end loaders came and nibbled at the elevator she fell, and the cameras of the townspeople clicked before the grain dust blurred the collapse from architecture to ruin the orange painted wood fell onto the scale until its brass arm bent the people were moved back, and the foundation was dynamited with thirty-two sticks of dynamite it was a spectacular retirement
two weeks before the elevator was levelled, the northern lights hung clear and full on the last night in ravenscrag the evenings were cool and the drought would end soon restless, i dressed and walked down to the elevator the town was moonlit and quiet deer crowded the fields and coyotes called to mother nature herself
the door to the weigh scale slid back in arthritic jerks inside, the bottom rung of the ladder to the top room caught some window light, but the rest was black and hidden i climbed slowly up, dislodging kernels of the last harvest with feet i couldn't see in the thickening dark the pigeons fussed, then panicked as i got nearer crossing the room with outstretched hands, i found the door to the outside world and stood out on the gangway, the whole town in its mix of past and present down below
i asked for ghosts: the remittance men, the section men, the postmistress, and aubrey phillips but the streets remained deserted ravenscrag is not a ghost town once it was one thing, and it is becoming another it has sifted out some reasons for growing and is finding others it is enjoying a brief push against the tide; it was once real estate, but for now it is just plain land

both the parliamentary committee on immigration and the economic council have recently urged lower immigration levels to retain canada's rapidly evaporating tolerance to cultural change no canadian, whether old or new will benefit if this tolerance is lost
expecting people to accept rapid social and cultural change is totally unrealistic the citizen has documented that half of low-rent housing in the area is filled with immigrants and that the equivalent of one classroom a week of non-english or non-french speaking children are dropped by an ignorant and unfeeling federal government onto the ottawa board of education an explosion is merely a matter of time and numbers

2124499474,Pellerin: Legault's Quebec - where a religious symbol isn't a religious symbol,Aucun(e) disponible.,"in order to live happily in quebec as a politically aware, sentient being, one has to forgo a little bit of logic
some days, one has to forget logic is even a thing take, if you please, the insistent tone and indolent shrug with which premier françois legault dismisses the idea that the crucifix is a religious symbol
wait, what?
if you took a deep breath and started relaxing when pundits told you the recent election was the first one in, like, ever where separation was not an issue, you might be shocked to hear this but the fact that """"separation"""" is no longer trending does not mean all is well on the other side of the river
quebec is having a bit of an identity crisis, especially over the question of how to welcome immigrants without losing its distinctness as a mostly white, mostly catholic-ish, french-speaking nation in recent years, it has struggled to come up with a model of integration that would satisfy most without running afoul of charter rights or, you know, basic human decency
one idea that keeps coming back is to impose a version of public secularism that more or less works in france separation of church and state is a given, and so is the freedom of regular people to worship - or not - as they see fit what's in contention is how much of people's private spirituality should be allowed to spill out onto the public square, and at whose expense can veiled women be tolerated on the street? can a sikh wearing a turban or carrying a kirpan be allowed on transit or in school? should you remove face coverings to get your driver's licence? can you work for the government wearing a yarmulke, especially if your job involves interacting with the public?
most people are ok with reasonable displays of religiosity, but not from their government the state must be seen as religiously agnostic so that everyone, regardless of creed, can feel equal under its laws there's a lot of support - in quebec and elsewhere - for this idea except for that giant crucifix over the speaker's chair in the legislative assembly which, it could be argued, has a smidge of public authority about it
legault's party made it a priority to forbid those in positions of authority, including teachers, from displaying religious symbols in order to protect quebec's secular identity so then are you going to remove that crucifix, installed under maurice duplessis back in the s? nah, he says that's not a religious symbol (it will also stay in courtrooms)
when a baffled reporter asked him how he could not see a cross on the wall as a religious sign, legault said, well, we have a cross on our flag - then swiftly moved on to not answering something else
you're probably struggling right now not to suffocate under the weight of such wilful blindness i know the feeling
""""in our past we had protestants and catholics,"""" legault added, forgetting the presence or contributions of first nations while lecturing others on history (time to update the licence-plate motto, methinks) """"they built the values we have in quebec we have to recognize that and not mix that with religious signs""""
that's ok take a minute to unspin your noggin i'll wait and point out that it's the height of cynicism for secular quebecers in  to defend both the legacy of maurice duplessis and waspian colonialism in a bid to defend quebec's st-century identity
it's maddening, but in a weird way it's completely normal too because quebecers are used to not being logical on religion they don't attend church much, except on very special occasions but when you ask them about religious affiliation, they're quick to claim one
quebecers are used to belonging to a religious group without having to bother with any of the religiosity they say they're catholic because it's part of their cultural heritage more than anything that's a perfectly valid position to take, unless of course you care about logic but as the recent election demonstrated, on that topic at least, it's nowhere near being a thing

berlin -- when children enter school at age six their futures are already mapped out for them whether they enter the academic or non- academic streams in germany tiered school system depends on their social class and ethnic background more here than in any other developed country
it is, as much as anything, this early imposition of low expectations and minimal education that has consigned germany  million immigrants, and especially the  million muslim turks and their children, to lives as an under-class in a parallel society
turks make up a quarter of germany five million unemployed and in some areas, such as here in the capital berlin, they represent about  per cent
it is a problem german governments have approached with hesitancy for some years however, the fundamental dislocations in german society took on extra bite and urgency after the break out of islamic militancy typified by the september , , attacks on the united states and, most recently, the october riots by muslim immigrants and their children in neighbouring france
there is no real expectation similar riots could happen here the relationship between the state and the immigrant communities in germany is different from in france and the turkish communities here are much more cohesive than they are across the border
""""you can see the same kind of dangers here,"""" said kenan kolat, director of the turkish association of berlin-brandenburg """"but i don't think there is a big potential for the kind of violence we have seen in france""""
malti taneja, of the german commission for migration, refugees and integration, agrees """"it not as dangerous a situation as in france no way,"""" she said

there is a broadly shared view in german government, turkish associations and civil society organization about how the problem has arisen at issue is whether german society has the will or the capacity to address its immigrant problem at a time of economic malaise and an abiding hangover after the euphoria of reunification with communist east germany  years ago
it will seem extraordinary to canadians, but it was only in  that the german government proclaimed that theirs was a country that accepted immigrants
even then the change of attitude was more an acceptance of the reality that the collapse of the soviet union and its east european client states in  saw the number of foreigners in germany nearly double to more than seven million by the mid s
before that, the more than four million foreigners in germany were seen only as """"guest workers"""" welcomed to power the country postwar economic miracle
they were expected to return home at some point, despite most of them clearly having settled here, arranged to be joined by their families and produced german-born children
it was not until  that citizenship was offered to existing and new immigrants to germany, and then only after eight year residence according to kolat of the turkish association only about one third of the  million ethnic turks have sought citizenship, even though  per cent are eligible

her doctoral dissertation on anti-semitism semitism and right- wing nationalism in quebec during the s has been awaiting approval by laval university for  months
very few have read it but since word of it got out last summer, it has provoked dozens of articles, editorials, commentaries and letters to the editor
delisle is being attacked for attacking lionel groulx, a priest who has been dead for  years, a historian for whom streets and schools are named
he's a nationalist hero to many of quebec's elite
groulx led the struggle against american domination of quebec's culture and economy, popular historian leandre bergeron wrote """"in his nationalism one finds an almost religious cult of homeland and the french language""""
but groulx is no hero to delisle in her -page thesis, she describes groulx and his s youth movement jeune canada as """"racist and fascist""""
she has been ostracized by academics, branded a traitor by many nationalists and used by federalists who would discredit all nationalism
meanwhile, she's """"starving,"""" unable to get a teaching job
""""when i started my research in , many professors warned me that i was committing professional suicide,"""" she recalls
""""but i don't care any more i won't work in a climate of fear where there are so many sacred cows""""
ask montrealers what groulx means to them and most will think of a downtown subway station before they think of """"the spiritual father of modern quebec""""
yet that's how he was eulogized by senior quebec cabinet minister claude ryan, an avowed federalist who later said it was groulx """"who first identified the state of quebec as the main instrument for french canadian society and culture""""
but groulx was also the quebec leader who called jews """"rotten foreigners"""" and """"commercial dictators"""" who spread communism, according to the thesis
he and his followers didn't spare french canadians either, haranguing them for their liberalism, their mingling with other """"races,"""" their preference for what he denounced as jewish-produced movies over the church
""""his themes were the leitmotifs of nazi germany,"""" says delisle
""""and yet many people in the elite - nationalists, academics, journalists - made a hero out of him to them, for me to say that he was a racist and a fascist, which he was, is an attack on all quebec""""
the lionel groulx foundation recently held a conference to defend their spiritual leader but delisle, whose work prompted the event, was not invited to defend herself
it was there that prominent sociologist fernand dumont said that if groulx's work was anti-semitic, how then to describe adolf hitler's mein kampf?
dumont insists groulx's admittedly xenophobic statements were merely """"a few embarrassing sentences"""" in a vast body of work
""""those (sentences) must be taken in context and not extended to color all of his work,"""" he told the star """"that they are being used that way proves that there are other motives at work here: the discrediting of all quebec nationalism""""
most nationalists say that the closed, catholic and francophone society groulx advocated is not a vision they share instead of railing against newcomers, today they welcome them by, for example, directing immigrant children into the french schools 
but anne-marie bourdouxhe of the federalist cite libre society insists that groulx's brand of extremist nationalism is still alive
""""you just have to listen to (parti quebecois leader) jacques parizeau, or even (premier) robert bourassa and you keep hearing that, unless we are very protected, unless we have our own country, we will disappear,"""" she says
ten days ago, delisle was the speaker at a cite libre fundraiser where her comments drew applause from former prime minister pierre trudeau and other prominent federalists to dumont, that proved that the attack on groulx is just quebec-bashing

lci television reported  vehicles were set on fire early today - compared with some  the night before
the sporadic incidents were a scaled-back version of the ferocious rioting that erupted eight days ago in clichy-sous-bois and spread across the troubled region of housing projects that are marked by soaring unemployment, delinquency and a sense of despair
the unrest took a dangerous turn the day before with rioters shooting at police or firefighters in three towns four shots were fired at riot police and firefighters, without causing injuries, said an official in seine-saint-denis nine people were injured in other unrest, officials said

a female passenger was slightly injured
police have arrested at least  people, said interior ministry nicolas sarkozy suburban residents and opposition politicians have accused him of fanning tension with tough police tactics and talk
sarkozy told french news channel i-tele yesterday that the riots wednesday night were """"not spontaneous"""" but rather """"well organized""""
speaking at the senate, villepin promised """"i will not accept organized gangs making the law in some neighbourhoods i will not accept having crime networks and drug-trafficking profiting from disorder""""
patrice ribeiro, national secretary of the synergie police officers union, said he suspected rioters aimed to turn their neighbourhoods into no-go zones so that drug-trafficking and racketeering can thrive

from an outburst of anger over the accidental deaths of two teenagers, the rioting has grown into a broader challenge against the french state
the violence has laid bare discontent simmering in suburbs where african and muslim immigrants and their french-born children are trapped by poverty, unemployment, discrimination, crime and poor education and housing
france muslim population, an estimated  million, is western europe largest but rather than being embraced as full and equal citizens, immigrants and their french-born children often complain of police harassment and of being refused jobs
despite the release yesterday of a preliminary investigation that appeared to exonerate police of any direct role in the teenagers' deaths, fear of unrest remained high
the teenagers - bouna traore, , and zyed benna,  - were killed oct  while hiding from police in a power substation youths in their neighbourhood suspect police chased them to their deaths
but the report, released by the interior ministry, said while police went to clichy-sous-bois to investigate a suspected intrusion on a building site, they did not chase the teenagers who were killed a third teenager who was seriously injured told investigators they were aware of the dangers when they hid in the fenced-off substation, the report said
benna father, amor benna, and the other teenagers' families filed a legal complaint to try to determine whether """"a mistake was made by security forces we want to know the circumstances that led to his death""""

""""However, in Andre Pratte the federalists have found a worthy successor of the former Quebec Liberal leader.""""","correction please note the headline on this story describes andre pratte as a separatist as he says himself, he was once a separatist, but parted company with the sovereignty movement after the referendum vote in  
federalists read less than sovereignists,"""" quips andre pratte, who has been pleasantly surprised at the response to his new and resolutely federalist book aux pays des merveilles essai sur les myths politiques quebecois (off to wonderland an essay on quebec political myths)
certainly, sovereignists do not lack for reading material
in the last few years, there has been a four-volume biography of rene levesque, a three-volume biography of jacques parizeau, memoirs by lucien bouchard and gilles duceppe, a three-part series of """"livres noirs"""" attacking english canada by normand lester, and collections of everything from great speeches on quebec independence to essays, articles and speeches by parti quebecois hard-line activist yves michaud
federalist books - and, for that matter, arguments being made on behalf of quebec remaining part of canada - are hard to find pratte, the -year-old editorial page editor of la presse, set out to fill that gap
""""i had the conviction that there were many things that were never said for the last  years or so in this debate in quebec,"""" he said in an interview """"the sovereignists dominate the debate so much that there are plenty of things that are taken for granted""""
he rhymes off the accepted wisdom in quebec - that quebec is ungovernable, that things are going badly, that quebec never gets what it wants, that ottawa is constantly centralizing power at quebec's expense
""""i found there was only one side of the debate,"""" he said """"it's not true; there are other sides of the debate that are never mentioned""""
but more than simply rectifying the equilibrium in an unbalanced debate, pratte also traces the markers of his own political trajectory
he describes himself as a nationalist and begins the book by recalling his attempt to convince an incredulous english-canadian journalist that a quebecer could change his position more than once on whether sovereignty or federalism best represented the future of quebec
as a student in the s, pratte was an admirer of the nationalist federalism of robert bourassa and claude ryan, but in , before becoming a journalist, he stuffed envelopes and went door-to-door for a young pq candidate, pierre-marc johnson
in the referendum in , he writes, """"like the great majority of young people at the time, i voted yes sovereignty-association seemed to me to be a very desirable form of renewed federalism""""
he felt wounded by the patriation of the constitution - and english-canada's celebration of it - without quebec in , and was profoundly disappointed by the death of the meech lake accord in  but, while he marched in the massive june  parade that followed the failure, the chants of """"le quebec aux quebecois!"""" left him feeling uneasy
similarly, pratte voted yes in the  referendum but was appalled at jacques parizeau's bitter speech blaming the defeat on """"money and the ethnic vote"""" the next day, in la presse, he compared parizeau to boris yeltsin and wrote, """"the sovereignty of quebec is perhaps desirable but not as long as dangerous personalities of this kind head the movement""""
that, he wrote, was the moment when he broke ranks definitively with the sovereignty movement and its supporters
since then, a series of what pratte describes as political myths - and also political fantasies - have taken root or been reinforced myths of martyrdom, exploitation and victimhood, and fantasies of liberation and riches
pratte follows the pattern of quebec demands (responsibility for immigrant selection, manpower training, parental leave) - often sought with loud insistence and complaints about federal inflexibility and centralization - which, when granted, inevitably vanish from public consciousness
""""today, it is the fiscal imbalance that is at the heart of quebec's demands,"""" he writes """"when that problem is settled the sovereignists will find another reason to be angry at the federal government and the quebec federalist leaders will follow, fearing that any other position will put in question their fidelity to quebec""""
similarly, he notes how nationalist historians and intellectuals dwell on the repression of the rebellions of  without paying much attention to what was achieved in the years that followed the rebellion by the leaders who fashioned the beginnings of canadian democracy
""""here is the myth of the victim in its simplest expression if the good patriotes had won, french canada would have known paradise,"""" pratte writes sardonically """"defeat, on the contrary, plunged it into a great darkness from which we have not yet emerged, and from which we will emerge on the day when the yes wins it is a pretty curious characteristic of independentiste thinking sovereignists want quebec to become independent and at last be fully responsible for their destiny however, until then, they don't hold these same quebecers responsible for anything that happens to them""""
pratte proceeds methodically through the sovereignist discourse, picking apart the claims that quebec will suddenly have much more money as an independent country than it does as a province, and will be fairer, more democratic and more french-speaking
while some of his arguments have also been made by federal politicians such as stephane dion and pierre pettigrew, pratte's position is distinctive in that he refuses to condone the approach that the federal government has taken towards quebec
he argues that the constitution must be amended to reflect the country the asymmetry created by quebec's distinct culture has to be understood, not feared and he is as appalled as any other quebecer at don cherry's rants
perhaps as a result, the book has been received respectfully, even by sovereignists who profoundly disagree with him
""""for several years, the quebec federalist camp has been short of credible intellectual spokesmen,"""" louis cornellier, a left-wing sovereignist, wrote in le devoir this month cornellier argued that dion and pettigrew are not at the level of the late claude ryan """"however, in andre pratte the federalists have found a worthy successor of the former quebec liberal leader""""
cornellier, like the late pierre bourgault, believes that quebec should become independent regardless of the economic consequences for him, independence would be liberating
pratte respects this position but rejects it """"i am saying you don't become sovereign just for the principle,"""" he said """"it's got to give something to people an intellectual can do it on principle, but the objective of those who govern quebec should be to improve the lives of people""""
pratte's book is, in part, an appeal to federalists to engage in the debate in quebec - a debate that has been clouded by  years of the sponsorship scandal - and make their case
""""the federalists should undertake to occupy the political, intellectual and emotional terrain permanently,"""" he writes """"not with money and flags, although the canadian flag should certainly flutter in the wind and not with an idealized vision of the country but with ideas, reflection, energy, eloquence, heart""""
so far, pratte has been pleasantly surprised at the response, having expected that the book would go unnoticed
""""i'm astonished at the number of people who have called me to say, 'at last someone is saying this; i've followed the same route that you have,'"""" he said """"there are a lot of people who think this way, but they don't say anything they don't dare""""

Carter teaches in New Haven, Conn., at Yale, the law school he graduated from. Judge Oliver, Talcott's father, was the first of the Garlands that Carter imagined. A colourful aspect of Judge Oliver's past is his losing the confirmation as an appointee to the Supreme Court of the United States.

(Hill's allegations against Thomas concerned sexual harassment.)","susan walker
the facts about stephen l carter, author of the summer reading pick the emperor of ocean park, fly in the face of several stereotypes
he's a lawyer who writes clear, readable prose of his seven published non-fiction titles, reflections of an affirmative action baby and the culture of disbelief: how american law and politics trivialize religious devotion have been widely read and discussed
second, he's a writer who enjoys writing (the standard line is dorothy parker's: """"hate writing love having written"""")
""""although writing is difficult sometimes, i love writing,"""" says carter, the day after addressing a breakfast audience in toronto and signing books at last month's canadian booksellers association's book expo """"whether it is fiction or non-fiction, i love putting words on the page i never feel depressed because i have to write something""""
third, he's an african-american who's about to be quite rich- from a first novel- but he is neither an athlete nor an entertainer
we know he's going to be well off because he earned a $ million (us) advance for the emperor of ocean park and a second novel the film rights for carter's legal thriller were sold to warner bros and the producers who make er and the west wing the fact that the book has gone into a third printing within weeks of its release, and that it is the first title to be picked for the today show's new book club, tells us he'll do quite nicely
readers of the emperor of ocean park will be less interested in carter's income than in the plot, the characters and this intriguing world in which """"the darker nation"""" co-exists, sometimes anxiously, with """"the paler nation"""" some will be curious to know if the author is anything like his narrator, talcott garland
talcott, or misha, as he's nicknamed, is a law professor- like carter- at an ivy league university in a place called elm harbor carter teaches in new haven, conn, at yale, the law school he graduated from
talcott is sparing with words and exceedingly polite but, in his mind, the reader finds, he's a cynic with a sardonic turn of phrase
but talcott's opinions are not the author's
""""talcott is very prickly a lot of what he's saying is there to provoke,"""" says carter, who certainly doesn't look as one imagines his narrator:  at the book's opening, medium height, a little overweight and taciturn
carter, , is very tall, slim and very talkative
talcott makes scathing remarks (to himself) about white liberals and condemns affirmative action by putting this proposition to his students: """"any white person who truly believes in affirmative action should be willing to pledge that, if his or her child is admitted to a harvard or a princeton, he or she will at once write to the school saying, 'my child will not be attending please hold the slot for a member of a minority group'""""
carter concedes that some things talcott says would be plausible to a reader like him """"many black professionals live in two worlds at the same time,"""" he explains, meaning the integrated workplace and the more private life """"where blackness may serve as a refuge""""
there's a line early in ocean park that startles the outsider: talcott has not been invited to a party thrown by a colleague, even though he stands reasonably high in the law school's hierarchy: """"but skin colour, even on the most liberal of campuses, contrives a hierarchy of its own""""
""""any black professional would tell you that,"""" carter says """"among themselves, many spend a lot of time complaining about how badly they're treated by white colleagues the issue is not whether it is true, but that this is the perception
""""this concern is an inevitable concomitant of america's racial history,"""" he continues, """"but i hope for a better day, perhaps as soon as my children's generation""""
the garlands are a family carter started imagining as much as  years ago """"they're not based on my family or anyone i know i have entire novels about them""""
these were the false starts, carter says, that led to the writing of ocean park sometime in the mid-s he was writing non-fiction at the same time
the novel occupied his late-night hours and sometimes weekends for about four years the father of two children, a boy of  and a girl of , carter was not prepared to neglect his family in order to write a book (his wife, a yale law school classmate, is enola aird she runs the motherhood project of the institute for american values) when he realized he had to hand something to an agent, he spent five weeks writing full time at the end of 
the book that emerged is a -page family saga that takes the form of a mystery """"i thought a mystery would be an appropriate way of investigating a family,"""" carter says talcott has to find out how his father died, and who, if anyone, killed him
judge oliver, talcott's father, was the first of the garlands that carter imagined a colourful aspect of judge oliver's past is his losing the confirmation as an appointee to the supreme court of the united states carter was a supporter of anita hill, who testified against clarence thomas in the  us senate hearings into his eventually successful confirmation as a supreme court justice (hill's allegations against thomas concerned sexual harassment)
ocean park is structured in neat chapters that usually end with a sudden revelation that keeps the reader going but the other page- turning aspect of the book is sociological: the glimpses into privileged african-american life are equally tantalizing
had he chosen to, carter had lots of autobiographical material to work with his father, lisle c carter, is a lawyer who served the us government in policy-making and headed two universities his mother, emily e carter, died in  carter's paternal grandmother, eunice carter, was on the team of prosecutors that put away lucky luciano, who was convicted of, among other things, running prostitutes
""""family legend has it that the black prostitutes whose testimony was important would only talk to her,"""" he says """"we think she was the first black female lawyer in new york state""""
carter's mother's family came from north carolina his father's relatives are from barbados and canada some of his ancestors were escaped slaves who crossed the border by way of the underground railroad some of their descendents, distant relatives of stephen carter's, remain in canada
carter was born in washington dc, then moved to harlem in new york city after another stint in washington, he moved with his family to ithaca, ny he graduated from high school there the family summered, like the garlands, in a cottage on martha's vineyard now carter takes his own family there
washington is a setting in ocean park, particularly the gold coast neighbourhood where the garlands live """"my family never lived on or anywhere near the gold coast,"""" carter emphasizes
but the book has taken him back to washington, as part of a book tour that runs through this month, except for a two-week family vacation
carter's second novel, containing some of the characters introduced in the first, is under way, perhaps to be continued late at night after long days on the publicity circuit

public safety minister vic toews ordered the action plan in a tersely worded letter to rcmp commissioner bob paulson in november after he leaked details about gender-based audit that concluded women account for just one-fifth of the workforce, are more likely to drop out of basic training and are generally jaded about the promotional process
the report, under wraps since dec , will be made public thursday, however, postmedia news obtained a copy in advance
in his report, paulson outlines a series of concrete steps to address harassment in the workplace and """"transparency and objectivity in promotions""""
the measures also focus on improving work-life balance for officers and attracting more women and other minority groups to the force generally as well as to the upper ranks each initiative includes targets and a plan for measuring progress
""""it's not good enough to say that we are equal to other police forces nationwide on employment equity-related issues we intend to lead,"""" paulson wrote in his preface to the report """"our objectives are plain: address the past, modernize today's management, and build for the future""""
according to the report, a plan already underway to """"centralize the oversight and administration of complaints"""" has, for the first time, produced, concrete figures on the number, type and location of harassment complaints
between february  and november , there were , harassment complaints from  different complainants of them, most were received this year which suggests """"they are being addressed expeditiously"""" the largest number of complaints, , related to """"interpersonal deportment"""" which can include bullying or """"humiliating or demeaning comments"""" exchanged between equals, the report says
abuse of authority accounted for the second largest number of complaints (), followed by discrimination () and sexual harassment which accounted for a mere  complaints in nearly eight years the pacific, which includes british columbia, had the largest number of complaints by region with , followed by the northwest which includes the prairie provinces central canada accounted for  complaints, while atlantic canada accounted for 
according to the report, the data is crucial if the rcmp is going to meet the  month standard for dealing with complaints
""""preliminary data suggests that the average rcmp complaint remains open for approximate  months,"""" the report says, adding that should improve once bill c-, the enhancing royal canadian mounted police accountability act now in third reading before the house of commons, becomes law and is implemented
the bill will also go a long way to-ward dealing with inappropriate behaviour in a timely fashion, the report says it will further """"clarify responsibility for all members,"""" establish clearer public accountability through a new civilian review and complaints commission and """"streamline"""" conduct, grievance and discharge processes
in an effort to build a more """"respectful"""" workplace, the report says the rcmp has sent more than , employees for """"harassment in the workplace"""" training this past year and plans are underway to launch a confidential process in early  where employees can raise concerns and seek advice
the report also outlines a recruitment plan that would see women comprise  per cent of the force by  - about a  per cent jump from the rcmp's current makeup visible minorities ought to account for  per cent of the regular member workforce and aboriginals  per cent, according to the report, which suggests """"restrictions on advertising"""" have proven an """"obstacle"""" when it comes to effective recruitment
according to the report, efforts are still underway to address the issue of backfilling employees who are on parental leave, boosting confidence in the promotion process and making sure physical testing is fair
the rcmp will also start conducting exit-interviews with women and other minorities who drop out of basic training to find out """"their reasons for leaving and encourage them to stay or rejoin,"""" the report says
according to the report, the rcmp will stick to """"merit-based promotion"""" instead of """"quotas"""" but will """"demystify"""" the criteria so people know what is expected of officers the force will also address mobility requirements which can be a deterrent
to address the fact that women are more likely than men to take early retirement from the rcmp, the report calls for more engagement with women as they reach the  year mark according to the report, the rcmp is now looking for a """"senior, consistent, fearless and credible"""" voice to take on the challenge of overseeing the implementation of the plan
the rcmp's gender audit action plan comes as the rcmp watchdog, the commission for public complaints against the rcmp, is set to release its official report thursday based on a year-long investigation into the force's handling of workplace harassment complaints

""""so if you're a citizen of the united kingdom, (and) you present your united kingdom passport, the executive order does not apply to you""""
after more than three days of confusion, it was the first official confirmation that canadian dual citizens would not be affected by the ban
the canadian government had previously received a private promise from trump's national security adviser, michael flynn, but nothing in writing
mcaleenan did not immediately say anything about permanent residents of canada who do not have canadian passports
the canadian government, however, says it has also been assured that these people can travel to the us as normal
the word from washington came just hours ahead of an emergency debate in parliament on the fallout from the us travel ban
last friday, us president donald trump signed an executive order that banned incoming refugees and blocked immigrants from seven muslim-majority countries - iraq, iran, yemen, sudan, somalia, syria and libya - for  days
the order spurred confusion about who would be allowed into the us as well as protests in several cities, and calls from the opposition for the canadian government to bluntly condemn the president's immigration and refugee order

for the time being at least, however, canada won't be changing its refugee policies, immigration minister ahmed hussen said after tuesday's cabinet meeting
""""this is an evolving situation,"""" hussen said, referring to news he had received that  refugees, who had been approved for settlement in the us immediately before the ban, would be allowed into the country
""""the responsible thing to do is maintain contact, continue to engage and make sure that we monitor the situation closely and make sure that we provide information to canadians, which we have done,"""" he said

1030982350,"Harassment claims the tip of the iceberg; The RCMP has been a white man's club for a long time, writes Colin Kenny. And life can be very hard for those on the outside","[...]there is perceived to be a class of individuals within the RCMP who get preferential status when those in power make arbitrary decisions, which is often. The Old Boys club couldn't continue to hold sway if there were systems in place to prevent its members from exercising privilege.","sex gets the headlines so when canadians think about harassment at the rcmp, sexual harassment is the first thing that comes to mind particularly this week as hundreds of women go to court with a class-action lawsuit against the force but the problem goes much deeper than that when it comes to harassment at the rcmp, sex is only the tip of the iceberg
harassment at the rcmp rears its head in many other forms: bullying, exclusion, contempt, ridicule, and retribution - to name a few
female members are prime tar-gets in all these categories, which isn't exactly surprising, given the rcmp's long-standing macho culture visible minorities get more than their unfair share of contempt as well no surprise here either - the rcmp was a white man's club for a long time
not that white men in the force are immune to harassment that might come as more of a surprise, but partially because white males still constitute a sizable majority at the rc-mp, there are probably more being treated as second-class citizens than there are females and visible minorities
so what's with all the unfairness? the nub of it is this: in any healthy institution, merit is at the heart of the pecking order merit may not win out on every occasion, human beings being the fallible creatures that we are but at healthy institutions, success based on merit is the rule unfairness is the exception
experts who have studied the inner workings of the rcmp in recent years certainly haven't described it as a healthy institution it probably isn't fair to describe incidents of un-fairness as routine - most of the nearly , people employed by the rcmp treat each other with respect but there are enough people who think of respect as a personality disorder to make unfairness a major issue it is an issue that is going to require a more enlightened kind of leadership at all levels to fix
among rcmp members i have talked to, some think allegations of harassment have been overblown that said, the majority of those i have queried believe the sexual al-legations actually cloud the more widespread plague of exclusion, bullying and humiliation
these people see the rcmp as an institution whose leaders have paid too little attention to fairness when it comes to promotions, discipline and who gets listened to when decisions within the organization are being made
these people say the old boys club is still alive and kicking at the rc-mp, even if its modern day members include a sprinkling of females and minorities as a result, there is perceived to be a class of individuals within the rcmp who get preferential status when those in power make arbitrary decisions, which is often
how does a person qualify for the old boys club? maybe you worked closely with someone in earlier years and """"had his back"""" as he climbed the ladder - and got to a place where he could pull you up with him maybe you played hockey on the same team and fed him the puck - hockey is big at the rcmp there are all kinds of ways to win loyalty
of course, loyalty doesn't out-weigh merit in a healthy institution, but that's not the rcmp there are systems (and sometimes unions) within healthy institutions that sup-port fairness but again, that's not the rcmp company-paid """"staff relations officers"""" are supposed to advance legitimate complaints, but not many of them are known for their dogged pursuit of justice
too many competitions aren't open, which engenders the belief they are rigged too many people who have committed real offences - including sexual harassment, or bullying - lose a few days' pay sometimes they are moved to other divisions sometimes they even get promoted meanwhile the grievance procedure can be a long, lonely vigil for the victim, too often violating the rules of confidentiality, too often ac-companied by shunning instead of counselling when punishment for the victim outweighs punishment for the offender, there's something radically wrong
when people who aren't members of the club get out of line, they find themselves consigned to what is widely known as """"the penalty box"""" - meaningless job, frozen smiles deputy commissioner raf souccar found out the hard way when he went public with complaints against then commissioner william elliott he says he quickly became a deputy commissioner without access, with-out a real job, and without an office he ended up resigning
the old boys club couldn't continue to hold sway if there were systems in place to prevent its members from exercising privilege but the systems at the rcmp almost seem designed to perpetuate privilege and discourage dissent there is a lack of faith in the ranks that people with power in the rcmp are capable of changing these systems, or even want to
i have said many men are discriminated against at the rcmp, and that is true but that does not excuse the amount of gender-based and colour-based discrimination that clearly persists within the force
how serious is gender discrimination? think of men bullying women - or showing overt contempt for women - simply because they are women and therefore deemed to inherently lack the qualities needed to be a tough cop
think of a supervisor telling that woman to """"suck it up"""" when she has been treated unfairly - because """"if you can't take the heat you shouldn't be in the force"""" think of toilet humour based on gender: """"what's wrong, you got your period, sweetie?""""
think of female officers being demeaned in front of other officers for not being physical enough in confrontations think of female officers being assigned the menial jobs think of women being repeatedly denied promotions when they have the best qualifications there are women in the upper ranks of the rcmp, but they are few and far between
i have learned that the rcmp is conducting a number of group inter-views with female members to try to determine how serious the issue of gender discrimination and harassment is within the force that's a start
unwanted sexual advances? they're bad - terrible, really but so is all this other crap that bubbles up from one common sinkhole - an institutional lack of respect the level of unfairness within canada's national police service is bad for women, bad for men, bad for the rcmp, and bad for the quality of service it offers the canadian public getting rid of rotten apples and even more rotten systems will take the kind of leadership - at all levels - that the rcmp has never seen before commissioner bob paulson says he's up for the fight if so, he had better get a lot of other moun-ties on side because there's no way he can roll this boulder up a mountain on his own

2195191003,Law on 'safe country refugees' struck down:   Federal Court rules key part of Harper-era reform of asylum system unconstitutional,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the federal court has struck down one of the last remaining planks of a controversial revamp of the refugee asylum system introduced with great fanfare by the harper government as a way to root out what it called bogus claims
on wednesday, justice keith boswell declared it is """"unconstitutional"""" for ottawa to treat refugees from so-called """"safe countries"""" differently from other refugees when it comes to being assessed to determine if deporting them would put them in danger
the ruling followed two previous court decisions that saw some of the other key elements of reforms enacted by the then-conservative government knocked down and dismantled
""""the system they created is a total failure, a flop,"""" said veteran refugee lawyer lorne waldman, who was not involved in the court challenge """"it was ill-conceived, ill-thought out the conservative government created a system that didn't work they trumpeted the reform as a st-century system, but it turned out to be the opposite""""
in , stephen harper's conservatives introduced a series of changes targeting refugee claimants from designated safe countries, subjecting them to different treatment these refugees were rushed through the asylum process, had restricted access to appeals and health coverage, and faced quick deportation the goal, the government said, was to """"prevent fraud and maintain the integrity of its border""""
critics note that people from so-called safe countries can still face persecution at home due to sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion
the safe country list initially included  countries and has since been expanded to , including the united states, czech republic, hungary and mexico
different parts of the reforms have been successfully challenged in court over the years the federal court has previously ruled that all failed refugee claimants should be granted access to appeal and the government was ordered to restore health-care coverage for all refugees
the remaining harper reforms still in place for safe-country refugee claimants include a -day waiting period for work permits refugees from other countries, meanwhile, can work immediately claimants from safe countries are given an asylum hearing within  days, versus  days for others the work permit wait is now being challenged in court
the refugee board has also said it is no longer following the quick timelines for hearings
in the latest decision, boswell declared it unconstitutional for ottawa to impose a -month bar on risk assessments for those from the safe countries as opposed to just a one-year bar for anyone else who has exhausted all available avenues to delay deportation
the court challenge was initiated by five failed asylum seekers, all citizens of hungary and of roma descent they all made a claim in , alleging fear of persecution in hungary based on their ethnicity, and in one case, the fear of gender-based violence
since hungary was deemed a safe country, they faced a three-year delay in getting a risk assessment after their asylum requests were rejected they claimed the rule breached the charter of rights and freedoms
with the passage of time, each of the litigants has jumped the -month bar, and lawyers for the government had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit because the cases were now moot they also argued that the group only represented roma from hungary and was not representative of everyone from the designated countries
the court disagreed
""""it involves an important constitutional issue, there is a fulsome record, and there is a strong public interest in finding not only an answer to the question of whether the three-year (risk assessment) bar violates the charter, but also in not allowing a potentially unconstitutional provision to persist,"""" boswell wrote
the court heard from witnesses for the litigants that canada had a history of excluding certain groups from immigration by """"vesting wide discretion in officials to establish geographical tiers of preferred immigrants"""" and that the safe-country regime had a negative effect on groups such as roma refugees in their ability to seek protection in canada
""""i think every person has a right to be treated the same, in the same situation for me to fight this, right away i said yes even though i might not be impacted by the law changing, i wanted to be here, because i thought 'this is wrong',"""" said richard sebok, one of the five roma litigants
""""why am i being treated differently than others? it was like i was back in hungary, being treated differently by the government in hungary i was treated differently because i am roma, and here i was treated differently because i am hungarian and i know that is wrong we all come from different countries to get protection and i did not want anyone else to be treated like i was""""
the litigants also challenged the way countries are being classified as safe or not
""""statistics on outcomes in refugee determinations from a given country can vary substantially over time, due to changing country condition evidence and random factors,"""" osgoode hall law school professor sean rehaag said in an affidavit """"a country may be safe for many claimants but unsafe for subsets of claimants""""
the federal government argued the asylum reforms were necessary because the refugee board was strained in  with a backlog of over , unheard claims and there was about a -month waiting time for an asylum decision currently, the board has , outstanding claims with wait times for a hearing hovering at around two years
teny dikranian, a former asylum policy manager at the immigration department, told the court it would take an average of four and a half years to remove a failed refugee in  because there were multiple layers of recourse available to claimants and no limits on the number of applications for failed refugees to delay their deportation
""""making the system timelier was necessary to address the growing backlog, to deter non-genuine claims, and to provide for timelier protection to those who need it,"""" dikranian was quoted as saying in the court decision
boswell said it was """"not necessary"""" to impose a restriction on risk assessments based on country of origin
""""timely access to (the assessment) is a significant benefit for failed refugee claimants and delaying this access to some claimants based on their country of origin impairs their right to equality,"""" boswell wrote in a -page ruling
""""nationals targeted for the delay  suffer the effects of discrimination for the period of the delay,"""" he explained """"this is an inequality that is disproportionate and overbroad""""
lawyers for the litigants, all of whom are still in canada, welcome the decision
""""you cannot tar an entire group of people based on nationality,"""" said anthony navaneelan, one of six lawyers representing the five refugee claimants in this court case """"this is textbook discrimination""""
canada is currently dealing with an influx of so-called """"irregular migrants"""" from multiple countries crossing illegally from the united states, which is deemed a safe country these asylum seekers are being dealt with according to their nationality, and not by their last place of residence
the public safety minister has until april  to file an appeal

239552967,"All laughing aside, Citizens' report soggy, mushy and gutless:   [Final Edition ]","It was fitting, too, that the overblown final ceremony was interrupted by a blown fuse, leaving Laurier La Pierre, the chairman, shouting that the forum had been jinxed from the start but the blackout was the fault of Hydro Quebec, not Keith Spicer. Did the commission ''listen to Canadians?'' Not to the vast majority. And even the 700,000 participants claimed by Chairman Keith Spicer is a vastly inflated number, involving an arbitrary doubling of discussion group participants and tripling the school kids involved in class exercises. At the press conference after the release of the report, Spicer was asked straight out whether the prime minister should resign. He sidestepped by saying he'd want to know who'd replace [Brian Mulroney].","  the report of the citizen's forum on canada's future will fade quickly into the forgotten past
it was somehow fitting that the final report was unveiled in the great hall of the museum of civilization on the quebec side of the ottawa river that way it could be quickly added to the collection, going straight from the commission to the display cases without an in-between dust-gathering phase
it was fitting, too, that the overblown final ceremony was interrupted by a blown fuse, leaving laurier la pierre, the chairman, shouting that the forum had been jinxed from the start but the blackout was the fault of hydro quebec, not keith spicer
this comic opera among the totem poles was the right windup of a commission which, by its squabbles and pratfalls, has given us a lot of comic relief
the final report isn't comic relief it's just mush
it tells us nothing about the mood of canadians that had not been reported over and over by opinion polls and the media
its gutless recommendations (''review multiculturalism'') don't even have the credibility of a united commission behind them
the unanimity implied by the  commissioners' signatures is a fraud three dissents, going to the soggy heart of the report, are recorded in print as for the rest, it seemed one need only scratch a commissioner to find a dissenter from the main body of mush or from one of the other dissenting opinions
did the commission ''listen to canadians?'' not to the vast majority and even the , participants claimed by chairman keith spicer is a vastly inflated number, involving an arbitrary doubling of discussion group participants and tripling the school kids involved in class exercises
one purpose of the commission was to manipulate the opinions of canadians to make them more amenable to meech lake ii, now being prepared by prime minister brian mulroney and constitutional affairs minister joe clark
the key part of this concoction is special status for quebec, sneaked into the constitution, probably under another name
canadians have become too tough-minded to fall for this plot, even under the influence of the group dynamics attempted by the spicer gang
canadians want equality of individuals and provinces
but in its interpretation of its findings, the commission sidestepped this clear demand and trumpeted a current theme of the mulroney government, that ''special arrangements'' (as special status and powers for quebec are now called) are a ''fundamental principle of canadian federalism'' i'll bet you thought equality, rather than inequality, was our fundamental principle
the most curious part of the final report, as of the preliminary report published in march, is the section relating to mulroney
in march, spicer went out of his way to shield the prime minister from criticism we know now that the preliminary report was released by the commission chairman on his own without consulting other commissioners
his interim report said the commission heard more criticism of mulroney than any other complaint, but the position of prime minister ''acts as a condensation point for many frustrations that have little to do with the incumbent personally''
at a press conference at that time, spicer said mulroney was a ''lightning rod'' for public discontent and it could happen to ''any leader''
by thursday, spicer had switched to reject the lightning rod as the whole explanation of what he called ''a fury in the land against the prime minister''
that phrase may be remembered, as will, ''our report lets the pm off too lightly'' both were in the ''chairman's foreword'' with which he surprised and sandbagged his fellow commissioners as he did with his interim report
why did spicer change his view of the pm's responsibility in the past three months? and what does he think the prime minister should do?
at the press conference after the release of the report, spicer was asked straight out whether the prime minister should resign he sidestepped by saying he'd want to know who'd replace mulroney
it's hard to know where spicer stands but one thing is certain by his unusual criticism of his own commission, he undermined any credibility the final report may otherwise have had

2484685430,"Restaurant owner confused by $880 fine:   Wonton Hut operator says he, and others, face conflicting requirements",Aucun(e) disponible.,"when doug ford mentioned he'd be coming down on big box stores like an """"-pound gorilla,"""" eddie yeung, owner and one of three employees at wonton hut, had no reason to think his small business had anything to worry about
""""we have signs, temperature control, sanitizer,"""" yeung said """"also no one is allowed to go into the restaurant unless it's take away or delivery there is no dine in""""
but on sunday, the restaurant situated in a strip mall plaza at highway  and warden avenue, received an $ ticket because it didn't have a written workplace safety plan - a requirement it didn't know about becuase of what yeung said was confusing and conflicting information posted on regional and provincial websites
york region's covid- guide for food premises states a safety plan is required, with a link to ontario's workplace prevention site that says it """"encourages"""" businesses to develop a safety plan, then says it may be required upon inspection
nadia varbanova, an inspector with york region public health, said the link may be """"outdated,"""" noting a safety plan was at one point recommended before becoming mandatory
since march , york region has conducted , inspections with  charges and has used its emergency notification system to make sure business owners are equipped with the latest covid- regulations and requirements
""""we send (it) to all business operators on our roster, and have also provided them links for further education,"""" varbanova said """"if operators don't understand or have questions, we are always available to help so now, the time has come to do enforcement""""
at the provincial level, the ministry of labour, training and skills development says it has conducted more than , covid- related inspections while inspections at the beginning of the pandemic focused on education, the emphasis is now shifting to enforcement the ministry's inspectors have been given discretion to issue tickets to businesses, owners, employers and customers the fines range from $ to $,
in york region, tickets for covid- violations given to individuals come with a preset $ fine plus a $ victim surcharge fee for corporations, the preset fine amount is $,, plus the $ victim surcharge
wonton hunt has a safety plan, it's just not in writing, yeung said to protect his parents, his two employees at the restaurant and his customers, yeung has spent more than $, since march on a variety of safety measures, including ppe, protective plexiglass, informational signs and temperature sensor machines they've also followed ontario's five-page guideline for cooks, servers and dishwashers since the beginning of the pandemic last spring
""""no one came to tell us we needed this plan,"""" yeung says """"now we find out the lack of communication with small businesses might end up costing them an $ ticket - which is a lot for us these days""""
along with confusing information on websites, yeung is also concerned that the rules are only outlined in english since receiving his ticket, yeung's called  other local chinese restaurants speaking to owners in cantonese and mandarin to make sure they know about the requirements about  per cent of the restaurants said they had no idea where to find this safety plan, he said
a  report by the municipality of york region gives a glimpse at how language barriers could be a problem among the findings: recent immigrants who did not speak english or french was more than double the national average markham was dubbed canada's most ethnically diverse community in , with  per cent of the population identifying as a visible minority
past communications from york has been translated into multiple languages, said melissa pinto, a spokesperson for york region, though she could not confirm which ones
""""if there is material that needs to be translated, it could be translated on the provincial side,"""" she said
yeung says he wasn't aware of any mass messages being sent out advising on covid- regulations for his area
he's now campaigning to have the language barrier better addressed
""""this really drew my attention and concern, maybe something needs to be improved,"""" he said """"we reached out to our local municipal government in hopes that more educational literature can be provided to small businesses, and information are not only in english, but in several different languages, so that small local businesses like ours can be educated to prevent from being fined""""

the toronto star didn't publish special sections such as this one, there were no restaurants touting """"dumpling festivals,"""" no full- page ads wishing everyone a happy year of the sheep, no community- sponsored dragon dances
chinese new year was a private home celebration in those days, a time of taboos, if you had a surname such as chong
in , chinese canadians were not allowed to work as lawyers, or doctors or in any of the professions they could not vote in federal elections and were forbidden from bringing to canada their wives and children living in china
but still, the language and traditions of the small chinese toronto community were maintained
and chong - chairman of the provincial social housing services corp, and former toronto councillor and go chairman - recalls his father """"cooking all the traditional meals"""" of chinese new year for himself, his younger brother and cousins (one of those cousins still hosts a chinese new year banquet at home and chong now celebrates with him every year)
he grew up """"very aware of all the traditions"""" of his background, speaking a cantonese dialect that was linked to his father's village, and daily attending chinese school - albeit reluctantly because he would rather have been playing sports - with his brother and cousins after regular school
occasionally, chong would hear racial slurs flung his way but the downtown chinatown area where he grew up had many immigrants, so the neighbourhood kids mixed together pretty well, he recalls
it was more the adult world that taught chong lessons about racism when his mother, margaret, a white woman, married his father, joseph, a chinese immigrant who came to this country at  with his father, her family disowned her
""""they wrote her off,"""" he recalls, and it was traumatizing chong grew up never knowing his white relatives and, to this day, has never met any of them
as well, the chinese community of the day frowned upon racial mixing, he says
as a child accompanying his father, a professional translator, to places such as the courthouse, he would sometimes hear disparaging remarks from adults about his dual heritage
""""they'd say things in front of me, about a chinese man married to a white woman, because they think kids don't pay attention""""
english was spoken at home, since his mother didn't speak any chinese dialects as a result, even though he attended chinese school, his fluency in speaking, reading and writing chinese was haphazard (as an adult, he pursued his studies and now reads chinese newspapers)
his cousin was sent over by his father's brother from china and grew up with the chongs in those days, chong recalls, there were many """"paper sons""""
in , canada repealed the exclusion act, which prevented wives and children born in china from joining their husbands
but full immigration rights wouldn't be given until , so chong says """"young unmarried people came in as someone else's sons - they called them paper sons""""
he says he was always aware of the restrictions and limitations people of chinese ancestry faced in canada """"it was something i was very sensitive to""""
even before he was allowed to vote, his father would order copies of hansard (the public record of parliamentary sessions) and pore over them """"i'd see him underlining things,"""" chong recalls
the fact that chinese canadians couldn't vote federally or enter the professions until  made chong all the more determined to exercise his right to vote, become a dentist and eventually enter public life
he was a founding member of the  toronto mayor's committee on community and race relations he's been a citizenship judge, toronto transit commission member and vice-chairman, and sat on metro's human services committee
even today, he finds it regrettable when chinese canadians don't exercise their right to vote """"it's so important because there was a time when they couldn't""""
in the next couple of years, chong intends to visit the village in china where his father came from, and where there's an ancestry book that traces the family back several hundred years it's all part of his history, but what defines him is his canadian citizenship
""""i'm a chinese canadian - i'm proud of my chinese background but i see myself first and foremost as a canadian,"""" says chong, who was formerly married to a japanese canadian and has two sons and a daughter
eldest son russell, , who works in corporate and investment banking in new york city, shares the same pride in being canadian
he grew up knowing both chinese and japanese traditions, and when he's in toronto at new year's, he visits his dad's cousin and celebrates with the traditional banquet
russell has a non-asian wife and a baby girl he says he respects all the ethnic traditions of his background, but defines himself first and foremost as canadian

the study, the second in as many years conducted by the angus reid polling firm for the immigration department, is designed to help the government shape programs on one of most contentious areas of public policy
among the most disturbing findings of the february poll of , canadians is the growing concern, especially in ontario and bc, that a high number of visible minorities entering canada are creating """"ethnocultural ghettos"""" and fanning the flames of racism
""""there was a feeling the government is perhaps doing too much to promote multiculturalism and may run the risk of generating racism rather than reducing it,"""" the report said
the report says that, although canadians do not wish to adopt the american melting-pot model, the public wants the government to promote the idea of """"being a canadian""""
the poll, released this week, also found:
* fifty-one per cent say canada's treatment of refugees has been either generous or too generous, with this feeling being most often expressed in ontario and british columbia
* although  per cent want the government to take in more immigrants and refugees,  per cent oppose this view and almost one- third believe """"too many"""" people are currently being admitted only  per cent feel """"too few"""" immigrants are being admitted to canada
* on a regional basis, quebec appears to be most in favor of increased immigration, based mostly on the belief that immigration is a solution to the province's declining population
in british columbia, where fear of floods of hong kong immigrants is high, respondents were twice as likely to say too many immigrants are being allowed into the country

Has he peaked too soon or does he have the momentum to win Oct. 30? Since he took the helm of the Yes side Oct. 7, Bouchard has attracted enough undecided voters to propel the sovereigntists into a slight lead over the federalists according to an Angus Reid poll released Thursday. However, that result is likely to be controversial given that the Reid group used a different methodology than most pollsters to apportion the undecideds. In effect, the poll found the two sides in a dead heat. A CROP survey published in La Presse this week put the Yes side ahead, with 43.6 per cent compared to 42.6 per cent for the No. But because the 14 per cent undecided voters are more likely to vote No, the sovereigntists must continue to build support over the final week of the campaign if they want a victory.","race to the finish: lucien bouchard has brought the yes forces neck-and-neck with the no side has he peaked too soon or does he have the momentum to win oct ?
savior to the sovereigntists, bloc quebecois leader lucien bouchard has single-handedly turned the referendum into a race
the key question with the vote  days away is has his support peaked
since he took the helm of the yes side oct , bouchard has attracted enough undecided voters to propel the sovereigntists into a slight lead over the federalists according to an angus reid poll released thursday however, that result is likely to be controversial given that the reid group used a different methodology than most pollsters to apportion the undecideds in effect, the poll found the two sides in a dead heat
that's a substantial gain, since they had trailed by as much as  percentage points when bouchard began his appeal for a strong mandate to negotiate a new partnership with canada
a crop survey published in la presse this week put the yes side ahead, with  per cent compared to  per cent for the no but because the  per cent undecided voters are more likely to vote no, the sovereigntists must continue to build support over the final week of the campaign if they want a victory
if they stall where they are now, the pro-canada forces are likely to triumph, says claude gauthier, vice-president of crop
``they have to gain to win the next polls will show whether it is just a surge, or if there really is a movement''
bouchard, however, can already smell victory
``i think we have the winning conditions in hand, and there is a potential of victory we have never been so close to a great victory for quebec,'' he confidently told a group of  pro-sovereignty lawyers earlier this week
that declaration came on the same day he held a press conference to express regret over his use of the term ``white race,'' his first blunder of the campaign
in his frequently quoted comments last week, bouchard said: ``we are one of the white races that has the least children, and that doesn't make sense it means we haven't resolved family problems''
it was the gaffe his political opponents had waited for bouchard, usually considered too popular among the quebec electorate for personal attacks, was denounced as a racist and a sexist
more ominous for federalists, the reid poll found that the yes forces seem to have captured the momentum in the campaign, despite the ``white race'' gaffe
the story caused a bigger furore in the rest of country than in quebec here, there was little response in the open-line radio shows, and his supporters continued to mob him at public appearances, wanting to touch him, kiss him, or deliver crumpled notes of support
many quebec women appear to believe that his statement was twisted by his opponents some say even if that was the case -- it is still true
``i would have loved to have had more children, but it was not possible financially,'' says jocelyne drolet, a montreal woman who teaches french to immigrants
``if we don't want to be invaded by immigrants, young people are going to have to have more babies that isn't racism, that is patriotism it has nothing to do with color, it has to do with our roots, our history, our ancestors''
bouchard concedes only a ``lost day'' on the campaign because of the controversy but it appears to have made him more careful
his early days on the trail were characterized by a certain wildness of speech sovereignty, he said, will be like a ``magic wand'' and cure many of quebec's problems
he has toned down the hyperbole, but not the passion he appeals to the confidence of quebecers have faith in yourselves, in your ability to run your own affairs, he tells audience after audience
he chides them for sending former premier rene levesque to negotiate with the rest of canada from a position of weakness, something he says he refuses to do
``give me the mandate and you will come with me it will be the people of quebec who will be at the table''
at a chamber of commerce meeting in montreal this week, that line brought the crowd of business people to their feet, cheering wildly
no side strategists insist they aren't rattled by bouchard liberal leader daniel johnson and prime minister jean chretien continue to stress that a yes vote means separation and drastic economic consequences
it could it be that bouchard, famous for his passion, is bringing out the emotional side of his opponents
johnson, chretien and conservative leader jean charest have all been speaking with more feeling and more conviction than at the beginning of the campaign
``i am going to say no to separation, i will say it with pride    the pride of a quebecer who believes that quebec's essential place is in canada,'' chretien said this week in quebec city

hold on to your seat the quebec government is looking for anglophones to work in its public service, and it is trying hard to find them
the number of anglophones in quebec's permanent employment is underwhelming if the anglophone representation in the ,-member public service coincided with the proportion of english-speakers in the population, there should be about nine per cent on the payroll instead, there are eight-tenths of one per cent

though many may consider government employment a rewarding way to understand the quebec culture, other anglophones may find the cultural gap hard to bridge: not necessarily at the desk or work station, but around the water cooler the annual turnover of anglophone staff, for whatever reason, is almost double the rate for francophones
the anglophone community obviously wants to support the quebec treasury board in its efforts it wants to encourage the dwindled anglophone population to stabilize, and form the critical mass desirable for its own well-being the few anglophones can hardly be considered a competitive threat in government jobs the close working relationships between anglophones and francophones in the public service also seem a contribution to mutual understanding only the nut cases in either camp encourage an anglophone exodus

A copy of the Hayakawa letter came to the attention of the trustees, who liked it and determined that the quiet, no-nonsense professor of language arts might be the right man for the presidency.

Below the photograph, he typed a caption: """"The insidious Dr. Fu Manchu,"""" an allusion to Sax Rohmer's fictional representation of evil incarnate - Asian style. A passing student read the inscription and, assuming some wise guy had written the caption, ripped it off and brought it to Hayakawa, saying: """"Look what somebody did!"""" Hayakawa was amused at the student's misapprehension.","mill valley, calif - nearly  years ago, a doughty little man in his early s, wearing eyeglasses and a tricolored tam-o'- shanter, leaped onto a sound truck encircled by hostile college students and, with an angry yank, ripped out the wires of the public- address system
almost overnight, that televised act - the plug-pulling viewed 'round the world - transformed dr si hayakawa, then the acting president of san francisco state university, into an improbable international celebrity: a university administrator who resisted the temper of the times by refusing to indulge student misbehavior camouflaged as high-minded intellectual dissent
hayakawa's one-man commando raid, and his continuing non- appeasement policies at san francisco state, won the japanese- american professor the sobriquet """"the samurai scholar"""" later, during his tenure in the us senate, his propensity to doze at committee hearings brought conferral of a less flattering appellation: """"sleepin' sam""""
in an interview recently in his home  miles north of san francisco, the soft-spoken hayakawa, now , talked about his life, the campus turbulence of two decades ago, his career in the us senate, and his continuing campaign for a constitutional amendment to make english the nation's official language
hayakawa was a nationally respected semanticist and professor of language arts at san francisco state when he was unexpectedly offered the presidency, a turnstile post that year
""""i was the third president they had in ,"""" hayakawa recalled """"the first president fled he called us from new york, saying he would not be back - that he had gotten a job offer in ethiopia and was taking it"""" hayakawa smiles as he recalls details of the defecting president's flight; he has a nicely developed sense of the absurd
urged moderation
the replacement for the runaway president, hayakawa said, was a professor from within the university, """"an able but stubborn man when the trustees started giving him orders he got mad and quit, too""""
the trustees came to hayakawa as their possible savior because of a letter he had written to radical professors at the university urging them to moderate their behavior """"it was a temperate enough letter, courteous, but it reminded them that we had certain obligations at the university - and that we were being sidetracked"""" a copy of the hayakawa letter came to the attention of the trustees, who liked it and determined that the quiet, no-nonsense professor of language arts might be the right man for the presidency
""""the radical professors were as much the problem as the students,"""" hayakawa recalled """"it was the decade of counterculture, and there were so many professors who had embraced this culture they all wanted to be groovy""""
on his first day as acting president, the opening day of classes after the thanksgiving break, hayakawa appeared on the street at the edge of the campus where the dissident students were blaring their messages from sound trucks he had posted notices all over the campus, forbidding gatherings and calling for the return of peace expecting trouble, he wore his tam that morning especially for the occasion, as """"a form of self-assertion""""
when he approached the students and told them to disperse, that by using sound trucks they were disturbing students taking exams, they answered him in two words """"one word was a transitive verb; the other was a personal pronoun""""
hayakawa then asked permission to use the speaker but was refused so he jumped onto the truck """"some of the students tried to silence me,"""" but hayakawa was having none of it before he ripped out the wires, he recalled one student saying: """"don't push me, dr hayakawa i'm your friend!""""
the televised incident was shown """"not just all over the country, but throughout the world,"""" he said """"that's what got me into the senate - i'm sure of it""""
in the cellar of his home are three large boxes of letters, post cards and telegrams from a diversity of people, almost unanimous in their support of his get-tough policy
what gave substance to his action is that hayakawa was and is a highly intelligent, thoughtful man and he has very definite, and traditional, notions of the role of a university in society
""""civilization needs a place where study is preserved,"""" he said """"in the middle ages it was the church colleges today are, or should be, what the medieval church was - that to which the hopes of human salvation are entrusted""""
he believes in academic freedom, but he emphasizes the academic aspect - """"the freedom to debate and discuss and weigh the merits of any body of ideas but to try the ideas out in actions is the function of businesses, trade unions, city councils and churches""""
hayakawa eventually succeeded in bringing peace to san francisco state, and the trustees soon deleted the """"acting"""" from his president's title he stayed on as president until the end of the academic year in , when he retired
there is a playfulness about hayakawa - a serious scholar who has never taken himself too seriously his sense of humor is often self- directed
during his teaching days at san francisco state, he once covered the window of his office with a picture of himself that gave him a sinister look below the photograph, he typed a caption: """"the insidious dr fu manchu,"""" an allusion to sax rohmer's fictional representation of evil incarnate - asian style a passing student read the inscription and, assuming some wise guy had written the caption, ripped it off and brought it to hayakawa, saying: """"look what somebody did!"""" hayakawa was amused at the student's misapprehension
a quirky sense of humor and a sometimes eccentric manner, however, are not usually a ticket to success in the solemn chambers and committee rooms of the us senate
not long after he took office in  (a lifelong democrat, he became a republican to seek the senate seat), his penchant for napping was noted and became a source of amusement to television's johnny carson, among others
hayakawa said once in an interview that reports of his senate sleeping were exaggerated, although he acknowledged that in politics images like that can be politically destructive """"i think it can be very, very damaging i would think a large number of people who get their basic information from johnny carson are very deeply moved by it - but johnny carson has put more people to sleep than anybody else in the united states""""
'hot as hell'
hayakawa denies that it was his age or pure ennui that caused him to drop off at committee hearings, preferring instead to impute this tendency to """"a concatenation of forces impossible to beat - the floodlights on you are hot as hell and sometimes i closed my eyes to keep the lights out and involuntarily fell asleep also, i'm more used to taking in information visually i'm not very good about taking things in by ear""""
since he left the senate in , hayakawa has served as a special adviser to the secretary of state and a few years ago made trips to thailand, laos and new guinea, """"to sort of show a friendly face from the united states""""
he is chairman of a group called us english, an organization concerned that """"our traditional language is becoming irrelevant as foreign languages become more and more widely accepted in our country,"""" and pressing for passage of a constitutional amendment to make english the nation's official language california and  other states have ratified the proposed amendment thus far
hayakawa notes that the hispanic leadership in this country opposes the proposal, but not the hispanic rank and file """"the general feeling among the hispanics is that if we don't learn english we don't get a job
""""bilingualism for the individual is fine,"""" says hayakawa, """"but not for a country""""

si hayakawa graduated from the university of manitoba, received his master's degree from mcgill university in montreal, and his doctorate from the university of wisconsin
in , he took a seminar with alfred korzybski on korzybski's language theories called general semantics
hayakawa's academic reputation rests largely, although by no means exclusively, on a book based on korzybski's theories called language in action, which was accorded the unusual distinction for a college text of becoming a book-of-the-month club selection in 
eight years later, hayakawa felt that the book was inadequate and he rewrote it, retitling it language in thought and action it has been translated into at least  foreign languages and is required reading in undergraduate english courses at many american and foreign colleges and universities he is working on revisions for a fifth edition
hayakawa wrote the book, he said, because he felt that semantics might inject some fun into english classes """"any beginning instructor in any english department is mainly concerned with freshman english, which usually means a total preoccupation with grammar and punctuation""""
in , he mimeographed a """"quickie"""" forerunner of his book for his freshman english class at the illinois institute of technology then syracuse university heard about it, and asked for a copy other colleges soon followed suit
dorothy canfield fisher, who was a member of the book-of-the- month club, was instrumental in making it a club selection, reasoning that """"here's a guy who is translating korzybski's difficult theories into language anyone can understand,"""" hayakawa said

unemployed, virtually penniless and unable to speak the language, the french couple's great canadian adventure had become the great canadian nightmare
in halting english, the couple, both , explained why they left their comfortable life near versailles, france, to take a new job in canada they told of the sense of adventure at selling their possessions in france and buying a home in windsor
then they told how the good life had come crashing down around their ears
they are suing the company that promised philippe a job and things are not nearly so bleak as they had been, but beyond a mere legal hassle, the bays' story is one of isolation, bureaucratic stonewalling and friendship
a year ago, philippe bay was developing and programming robotics for the french automaker, renault-citroen his wife, an accomplished pianist, was teaching piano at a local conservatory when philippe was approached about doing similar work for a windsor company, cody automation, bay said they decided it would be a good experience, especially for their two small children, and he signed a contract the immigration papers were authorized and a starting date of sept , , was set
in may, the bays came to windsor to scout the housing market and look at the lauzon parkway plant while in town they stayed with the company's president chedo grujic
after selling everything they owned in france, the bays set up house in their forest glade home, eagerly anticipating phillipe's new job
he never even got in the door
when he showed up for work sept , bay said he was told that an internal power struggle between canadian and american interests at the company had led to the elimination of his job the manager """"was at the door, he said it was not possible,"""" bay recalled, shaking his head """"he said, 'i have nothing for you'""""
liliane, fearing her husband's limited command of the language was misconstruing the company's meaning, took the children to the plant and was told again there was no work
for three months, the bays waited and worried about what they were going to do their english, broken at best, hampered their ability to tell people about what was happening to them while their savings disappeared at an alarming rate
finally, in november, they decided the promise of a job was nothing more than that and they contacted a lawyer
""""my first job in canada is to find a lawyer,"""" said philippe ruefully
the bays and their lawyer richard hawrish launched a suit against grujic and cody automation, an action that is still being decided hawrish, who was reluctant to discuss the case, said the company squabble was being fought before the bays came to canada
finding a lawyer may have offered some peace of mind, but it did little to put food in the refrigerator with no income the bays' savings soon evaporated
they put their house up for sale then came the humiliating trek to the city's welfare office there, they were told that since they weren't canadian citizens they didn't qualify
""""we are not poor, but we don't have any money in the bank,"""" said liliane, recalling the explanation she gave to city officials finally, after a little coaxing and the help of a friendly social worker, a cheque was issued
but when it came time to test the job market, philippe found himself in a strange position
not only could he not speak the language, but because he wasn't a landed immigrant, a canadian citizen, or a refugee, he couldn't apply at canada manpower and wasn't eligible for employment assistance programs
philippe also was ineligible for unemployment insurance and since he was admitted to canada to work for a specific company, there was little canadian immigration officials could do for him
""""i said, i am not a terrorist,"""" philippe said
gerry belanger, the acting manager at the local immigration office, said these types of situations often come up because the job market is so volatile but, he said new visas are usually granted once another job is found
because they have not been forced out of their country like refugees, belanger said the onus is on them to find new employment
""""it's difficult for the foreign worker sometimes things aren't that straightforward,"""" said belanger but, """"people have to help themselves that's the reality, they're on their own""""
on his own, philippe applied to about  local firms, finding many times that he was over qualified for positions alone and desparate, the bays considered moving back to france

""""they are beautiful people,"""" said bulke, who is the president of bel kraft international ltd """"i think they're a victim of circumstances i don't think there was a heck of a lot canada could do""""
but beyond helping in the search for a job, the french-speaking bulke has become a friend the two couples spent christmas together and the bays have been able to meet other people as a result

then there was the head of the local montressori school where four-year-old guillame was attending, who allowed him to stay even though payments could not be maintained
as well, the wife of one of their lawyers has hired liliane to play piano at her dance class and the 'for sale' sign has come down off the front lawn

437286995,Employment equity simply wasn't necessary Minority groups well integrated into economy:   [Final Edition ],"Despite the many, many lies told about it, ``employment equity'' didn't fool the people for a moment. Even the name is a fraud, invented in 1984 by current Ontario Court of Appeal judge Rosalie Abella because she thought it sounded less threatening than ``affirmative action.'' An even more pernicious set of lies sought to persuade Ontarians that quotas were necessary. Ontario had to be painted as a hideously racist place, somewhere between Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa. Stephen Lewis played a major part in this campaign, but he was joined by a large supporting cast, most of whose incomes depend on maintaining the illusion that this is a very racist society indeed. According to the summer 1995 edition of StatsCan's quarterly publication, Canadian Social Trends, while members of visible minorities were slightly less likely than other Canadians to be employed in managerial occupations, which is probably accounted for by the fact that ``visible minority adults are generally younger than other adults,'' members of visible minorities were as likely as other Canadians to be employed in professional occupations.","no policy did more to ensure the defeat of ontario's rae government than ``employment equity''
despite the many, many lies told about it, ``employment equity'' didn't fool the people for a moment even the name is a fraud, invented in  by current ontario court of appeal judge rosalie abella because she thought it sounded less threatening than ``affirmative action''
the most persistent lie about ``employment equity'' was that it didn't involve the imposition of hiring quotas the rae government spoke of ``mandatory numerical goals and timetables'' which, it said, were not at all the same as quotas
but the people knew better when mike harris denounced ``quotas'' in his election ads, everybody knew what he was talking about
an even more pernicious set of lies sought to persuade ontarians that quotas were necessary ontario had to be painted as a hideously racist place, somewhere between nazi germany and apartheid south africa stephen lewis played a major part in this campaign, but he was joined by a large supporting cast, most of whose incomes depend on maintaining the illusion that this is a very racist society indeed
this campaign was hampered by a decided lack of factual information there was stephen lewis' letter to bob rae after the yonge st mini-riot of  this quickly became treated as if it were divine revelation, but actual data on the extent and virulence of ontario's racism were hard to come by
such serious studies as existed suggested an opposite conclusion, that members of so-called visible minorities were doing quite well in canada and that canadian society was having remarkable success at integrating an increasingly diverse population
two studies by the now-defunct economic council of canada are relevant here in , it released new faces in the crowd, which concluded that canada had successfully assimilated immigrants from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds and that there was no observable tendency toward discriminating against immigrants from third world countries
this was followed in  by earnings of immigrants, which found no evidence of systematic pay discrimination against immigrants on the basis of color
recent information from statistics canada supports these conclusions
according to the summer  edition of statscan's quarterly publication, canadian social trends, while members of visible minorities were slightly less likely than other canadians to be employed in managerial occupations, which is probably accounted for by the fact that ``visible minority adults are generally younger than other adults,'' members of visible minorities were as likely as other canadians to be employed in professional occupations
these simple facts utterly deny the picture of a society seething with racial tensions and hostilities so lovingly painted by the rae government and its ideologues
the statscan report makes clear that at all levels of the economy visible minorities enjoy rates of employment and rates of pay which are generally comparable to, and sometimes better than, those of other canadians
what the statscan report also does, however - and its title ``visible minorities: a diverse group'' is telling - is point up a fundamental flaw in the rae government's approach to ``employment equity''
the employment equity act treats members of visible minorities as if they made up one single homogenous, monolithic whole
nothing could be further from the truth
the one example of japanese canadians is especially striking,  per cent of japanese canadians are employed in managerial positions and  per cent in professional occupations, whereas only  per cent are found in manual work and  per cent in service jobs similar variations are found throughout the report
these variations give some cause for concern, but the employment equity act was far too crude a tool to have addressed them
more to the point, the statscan report raises doubt as to whether the term ``visible minority'' can have any economic or social meaning
the people of ontario had no enthusiasm for ``employment equity'' polls consistently showed that  per cent of the people were opposed, which makes clear the opposition to quotas consisted of far more than simply white males
mike harris responded to this fact and his unequivocal opposition to quotas was crucial to his election victory
harris now has announced he will make good on his pledge to repeal the employment equity act this inevitably will mean closing the employment equity commission the new premier also could give serious thought to beginning the dismantling of the entire public racism industry the bloated, out-of-control human rights commission would be a good place to start
``employment equity'' is dead in ontario no tears should be shed at its passing and no one should be thinking about reintroducing it through the back door

well, no manfred becker, a toronto documentary filmmaker of german descent -- he grew up in post-war germany -- was taken aback recently when his -year-old son was called a nazi by classmates on a school playground in canada, just because his father is german

2184346172,Bigotry against Western Canada keeps on rollin',Aucun(e) disponible.,"the bigotry against western canada just keeps on rollin'
how else to describe the comments tuesday over the united we roll convoy of some  trucks filled with people from across canada protesting against federal government policies that harm canada's resource sector, particularly oil and gas
perhaps the best example of that virulent prejudice comes from tabatha southey, a columnist with maclean's, who wrote: """"this is not furiosa and mad max storming the citadel it's more national lampoon's white nationalist vacation""""
to call this convoy - which started in red deer on valentine's day - """"white nationalist"""" is grotesque they are hard-working, taxpaying citizens who are concerned mostly about what's happening to canada's oil-andgas sector, how it is attacked not just from outside canada but from within their own federal government
might there be a white supremacist in the midst of them? it's possible
but, i spoke to a dozen or so people in red deer - including a good number of yellow vesters - and i certainly didn't meet any and i actively tried to find some
one of the issues mentioned on the convoy's facebook page included opposition to the united nations global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration canada signed onto the migration compact in december and some people are concerned it will affect canada's sovereignty over its borders there are some pretty ugly comments online about this compact that doesn't mean all opposition to it is illegitimate that there is an issue with canada's southern border is evident that many canadians - in fact a majority according to a january ipsos poll - are unhappy with """"irregular"""" migrants walking over our border, is not necessarily a sign of racism
on cbc tv's power and politics, the reporter who was invited to the show to talk about the rally on parliament hill following an almost five-day, ,-kilometre drive didn't even mention the carbon tax, or bills c- or c-, which are the main causes of concern and reason behind this convoy it's troubling and, again, so very bigoted
but the folks on the convoy aren't watching cbc or following anticonvoy trolls on twitter
convoy manager glen carritt said everyone was completely """"overwhelmed by the support they received from across canada
""""the crowds of people on overpasses holding signs or along the roads, it was just unbelievable,"""" said the innisfail, alta, town councillor and owner/operator of op fire and safety - which provides medical and fire services to oilfields across all of western canada
what does he think about media comments that the united we roll convoy is white supremacist or racist? """"those people have to drive on the convoy with us and meet us and all the people we saw on the road and that would change their mind,"""" said carritt, 
""""we welcomed everyone to join this movement who isn't hateful or racist and who wanted to draw attention to the damaging actions of the federal government against an industry that is hurting and that the entire country relies upon for its well-being,"""" said carritt """"that's just some people who want to change the narrative the real narrative is this convoy has done more to reunite canada than anything that's happened in recent history and i think people are holding on to hope that we might get some change in our government""""

autobiography, common ground: my past, our present and canada's
future, will be published this fall!
yes, indeed the liberal party's head honcho will join the list of
canadian political leaders who have written their memoirs before an
election campaign
what stories will he tell? what strategies will he unveil? what
secrets will he reveal?
oh, and here's the most pressing question: what in god's name has
trudeau exactly done in his life to fill up an entire book?
you know, i don't have the slightest clue
trudeau is  years old he received his ba in literature from
mcgill university, and a bachelor of education degree from the
university of british columbia he worked as a social studies and
french teacher at west point grey academy and sir winston churchill
secondary school he had a small role in the  cbc mini-series,
the great war
with respect to politics, trudeau has been a federal mp in the
quebec riding of papineau for less than six years he was the
party's critic for youth and multiculturalism, citizenship and
immigration, and post-secondary education, youth and amateur sport
he became liberal leader in april , largely due to his political
lineage
that's about it
i'm not saying trudeau should hide his head in shame yet there's
been nothing significant in his life to discuss in a book
his political career is still in its infancy he's not an
intellectual or policy wonk like his father, pierre elliot trudeau
he doesn't have any profound domestic or international views to
discuss in great depth his accomplishments have been few and far
between
trudeau's autobiography should therefore only fill up the
equivalent of a small notepad!
in fairness, there may be a time and place for his memoirs down the
road if trudeau ever becomes (god forbid) this country's next prime
minister, that would certainly make sense
then again, maybe trudeau should take his lead from a political
rival, prime minister stephen harper
our nation's nd prime minister has been in office for more than
eight years harper is an intellectual, policy wonk and master
political tactician he has dealt with various challenges concerning
the canadian economy he has met with droves of world leaders and
great dignitaries he has played an important role on the
international stage
harper has had a consequential life and career he could certainly
write his memoirs
so, what did he do? in those rare free moments at  sussex drive,
he gradually wrote a book about the history of the toronto maple
leafs -- and not himself his memoirs will surely be written one
day, but there's no pressing need to do it while he's still in
office
think about it trudeau has accomplished very little to date, and
needs to write his memoirs to prove he can be a leader harper has
been a leader, and doesn't need to write his memoirs to justify
what's he already accomplished this speaks volumes about the
substantial differences between these two politicians the liberal
leader's manufactured pomp and circumstance doesn't compete with the
tory pm's proven track record in politics and economics
harpercollins, who will proudly publish trudeau's autobiography,
isn't worried about this they've already called it a """"candid
memoir,"""" and will receive a tsunami of publicity and sales
the rest of us will eventually pluck it out of the -cent bargain

a review of the reproductive success of northern geese by the cws and its us counterpart in early august showed the birds that nested in the remote areas of northern quebec, referred to as the atlantic population, have had another disastrous year
``the geese are very sensitive to weather, and this year was another in a succession of poor breeding seasons,'' says ken ross at the cws ontario regional office ``their numbers could be down as much as  per cent from ''

ross adds that these closures may be with us for a while although geese can bounce back quickly, the recent trend is all downhill
the shortage of northern birds is in sharp contrast to an abundance of resident canada geese along the st lawrence river, west of cornwall, which offers shooting opportunities both before and after the protected period
these are prolific local birds that frequent golf courses and parks and make a general nuisance of themselves until the shooting starts they give the impression that all is well in the bird world, when the facts seem to be quite different for their look-a-likes that live in less civilized areas
``southern canada is are going right through the roof, and everyone thought that things were ok until we looked at where the birds were from,'' ross says
sport hunting for geese in northern camps run by indians is also affected, but the natives themselves can continue to hunt
the cws estimates that aboriginal hunters kill , geese and , ducks in their annual spring and fall hunts across the north
the natives have been informed of the alarming status of the atlantic goose flocks and encouraged to restrict their harvest

""""It belongs to the Chinese community."""" Nowadays, only about 300 Chinese-born people remain in Cuba, and they are generally well advanced in years, mostly in their eighth or ninth decades. They are clustered in Havana, most of them in an area of town still known as Barrio Chino, a part of Central Havana that unfolds to the west of the gleaming white Capitolio building. Like thousands of others, he arrived in Cuba in 1949 after fleeing the advance of Mao Tse Tung and the communist legions in his homeland. At the time, Cheong was just 24 years old. Unlike most of his compatriots, he has remained in Cuba.","most people probably think that there is no such thing as a privately run printing press in communist cuba, but they are wrong
there is at least one
amid the island's sombre thicket of state-owned newspapers and magazines - including such pro-revolutionary titles as """"olive green"""" and """"rebel youth"""" - a single publication stands out
granted, it's not very large (about four pages) it doesn't employ very many people () it doesn't publish very often (twice a month) and it doesn't print very many copies (about  per issue)
the publication in question is not opposed to the revolution, either this is cuba, after all
but the paper is privately owned and privately operated - and these are almost unheard-of attributes in this caribbean outpost of communism, especially when it comes to the dissemination of the news
the paper also has its very own printing press, a hulking antique machine, manufactured in  and imported from the united states, a press that still shudders into motion once every two weeks
the name of this remarkable publication?
""""kwong wah po""""
the words mean shine, china in cantonese, and for long decades this former daily, former weekly, and now fortnightly publication has been a beacon for cuba's once thriving chinese community
""""this is the only private publication in cuba,"""" says publisher angel cheong, , as he guides a visitor through the newspaper's rather gloomy premises located in the havana's now shrunken chinatown """"it belongs to the chinese community""""
or what's left of the chinese community
once upon a time, cuba's asian population numbered well into the tens of thousands, operated a range of prosperous businesses, supported several newspapers and an array of cultural societies, celebrated the chinese new year in grand style, and included at least one member of the country's national assembly
but most chinese islanders fled the country soon after the  revolution that ousted dictator fulgencio batista and brought fidel castro to power, ushering in the era of communist rule that continues today
considering that it took place just  years after china itself endured a similar upheaval, the cuban revolution hit the island's chinese inhabitants like a category  hurricane some headed for the united states, others for canada, still others for taiwan
although it is no longer what it once was, cuba's chinese community is still able to make its presence known - its presence and its cuisine
a short march from the offices of kwong wah po, for example, a pedestrian street called el cuchillo de zanja knifes its way through central havana, jammed with chinese restaurants and other asian enterprises
chinese lanterns dangle overhead, parrots chirp in cages and young women in oriental costumes clutch menus as they prospect among the passersby for customers
the chinese fare around here may not be a match for lower spadina avenue or for times square in richmond hill, but it is cheap
at the huang hu restaurant, for example, a generous serving of chop suey de pollo, accompanied by a cristal beer and a jolting cuban coffee will set you back just $ us
meanwhile, determined efforts are underway to revitalize and celebrate the island's chinese heritage
earlier this year, hundreds of chinese from north america and china itself converged upon the island to celebrate la fiesta de chinos del ultramar - the festival of chinese overseas - with cultural exhibits and culinary workshops
other initiatives have also been launched, aimed at bringing new life to a depleted community - and this is a depleted community
nowadays, only about  chinese-born people remain in cuba, and they are generally well advanced in years, mostly in their eighth or ninth decades they are clustered in havana, most of them in an area of town still known as barrio chino, a part of central havana that unfolds to the west of the gleaming white capitolio building
""""here, they are concentrated, so you see them more,"""" says julio tan, , whose chinese-born grandfather died when he was just  years old """"the pure chinese here were born in china""""
but cuba's present-day chinese community also includes some , descendientes - descendants of full-blooded chinese residents - most of whom, like tan, are of mixed race
""""we are very mixed in with the cuban community,"""" says zoe herrera, a descendiente herself """"i have black, chinese, mexican, and i imagine spanish blood, too but all cubans are like this""""
cheong, the venerable publisher of kwong wah po, is among the few remaining asian exceptions
like thousands of others, he arrived in cuba in  after fleeing the advance of mao tse tung and the communist legions in his homeland at the time, cheong was just  years old unlike most of his compatriots, he has remained in cuba
although many thousands of chinese immigrated to cuba in  or shortly afterward, the chinese community's roots on the island actually go back a lot farther than that
the earliest chinese immigrants in cuba began arriving in , and they came to work in the sugarcane fields as indentured labourers
during the following four decades more than , chinese found their way to cuba, a larger number than immigrated to california during the same period the vast majority of them came from the island of macao, near hong kong and no doubt hoped to better their impoverished lives
unfortunately, they did not find conditions easy under the swaying royal palms and the blistering caribbean sun - just the opposite
gradually, however, the chinese improved their status on the island, graduating from the cane fields to domestic service later, they purchased land of their own or opened private businesses
increasingly, the island's chinese population intermarried with cuba's other people, whether black or white or a bit of both
following the cuban revolution, however, the island's community of chinese and their descendants went into steady decline, in numbers, visibility, and energy
""""it wasn't the same to be a descendant in the 's and 's as to be a descendant now,"""" says tan """"the spirit had fallen through the floor""""
lately, however, this has begun to change
nowadays, the community has a new cultural centre at salud  in central havana - a handsome colonial row house with a whitewashed, blue-trimmed exterior, lofty ceilings, and stained-glass windows
known formally as la casa de artes y tradiciones chinas - or informally as la casona - the centre houses a library and mounts exhibitions of works by local chinese artists
many present-day cubans who can claim some share of chinese ancestry now seem interested in exploring their asian roots with a degree of zeal that simply did not apply before
even so, the island's chinese community lacks one essential component, without which no ethnic group can expect to flourish - new members
angel cheong at kwong wah po knows this as well as anyone
when he contemplates the future of cuba's chinese residents and their descendants, he does not exactly brim with optimism
""""it depends on cuba,"""" he says """"if there is immigration, the community will survive but, right now, there is no immigration""""

""""that is no longer the reality in canada we need to catch up with our own history""""
the two social activists teamed up this winter, to examine some of the comforting fallacies surrounding canada's treatment of its visible minorities they presented their findings at a panel discussion, monday, on how to build an inclusive society
omidvar is the executive director of the maytree foundation, which specializes in immigrant settlement richmond is the manager of policy and research at the community social planning council of toronto
the first point they made is that canada is coasting on a - year-old reputation policies that were once progressive have grown creaky attitudes that were once enlightened are behind the times
omidvar compared canada's immigrant settlement system to a poorly- lit one-lane street """"what we need is a six-lane highway for cars and trucks and suvs,"""" she said
getting established in a new country is a three-stage process, she explained in their first few weeks, immigrants need basic services such as translation, shelter, rudimentary language training and referrals to social agencies in the second stage, they need the tools to become self-supporting: a job, housing, access to the health-care system and recognition of their credentials in the final phase, they need the opportunity to participate fully in the social and civic life of their new home
""""most of our immigration policies stop at stage one,"""" omidvar said """"that's is why so many immigrants end up driving taxis and working in factories""""
if canada is such a welcoming nation, she asked, why are immigrants shut out of their professions? why are they turned down when they apply for bank loans? why are they ineligible for student assistance until they can show a year's residency?
richmond took up her theme """"there's been far too much abstract discussion of whether multiculturalism is a good thing or a bad thing,"""" he said """"what we need to look at is the contradiction between our official policy and the reality for canada's newcomers""""
multiculturalism was introduced at a time when immigrants didn't need extensive support, he pointed out they could get high-paying jobs in manufacturing or construction, with little english and limited schooling if they worked hard- and most did- they could earn as much as their canadian-born counterparts within  to  years
breaking into today's labour market is much tougher without a university degree, fluency in english and work experience, immigrants stand little chance of getting a good job even those who are highly educated, but come from asia, africa or the arab world, face the prospect of either prolonged unemployment or working in low- wage service jobs
much as liberal-minded canadians might want to deny it, the two panelists concluded, the country's urban centres- toronto in particular- are developing an immigrant underclass sociologists call this the """"racialization of poverty""""
fortunately, richmond and omidvar came to the symposium to do more than shatter illusions they began to sketch out what an up-to- date version of multiculturalism would look like
first, federal politicians would match their brave words about openness and equality with practical help for immigrants for too long, ottawa has let newcomers in, but failed to provide municipalities and voluntary agencies with adequate funding to care for them
second, settlement services for immigrants would be expanded beyond the bare essentials newcomers need more than temporary accommodation, language classes and employment counselling to feel at home in canadian society
third, governments would reverse the shortsighted cutbacks that have weakened the nation's capacity to absorb immigrants they would put money back into english-language training, adult education, social assistance and affordable housing
finally, policy-makers would engage canadians in a dialogue about how to move beyond the old concept of multiculturalism, which featured ethnic foods and festivals, to a more sophisticated definition that emphasizes the courage and experience of people who have coped with hardships that most native-born canadians have never known
politicians are fond of describing toronto as home to the world
but for those waiting on the doorstep, the welcome mat looks a bit frayed

1372107228,Canadian dream proves to be mirage,"The long-time labour activist and educator, who currently holds the CAW-Sam Gindin Chair in Social Justice at Ryerson University, calls her 87-page post-mortem """"a tribute to the resilience and resistance of the former PMP (Progressive Moulded Products) workers who were robbed of their jobs, severance compensation and sense of security and pride as contributing members of the community.""""","  in the annals of labour strife, progressive moulded products of vaughan holds a place of infamy
on canada day, , the auto parts company closed abruptly, leaving its , employees in the lurch they were given no warning they were not allowed into any of the company's  plants to collect their belongings there was no termination or severance pay
they rallied outside the company's headquarters hoping to meet managers and get what they were owed but they were barred by security meanwhile, transport trucks were being loaded with the moulds they had used to manufacture everything from dashboards to air vents knowing they'd be powerless if the plants were stripped, they organized a blockade for  days, they stood their ground, refusing to let the trucks pass
the showdown ended when a court ruled in favour of the company, allowing it to remove the picketing workers -  per cent of them immigrants - from its property the one good thing to come out the protest was that the union movement rallied behind the unorganized workers the canadian auto workers (caw) took the lead working with the ontario ministry of training, colleges and universities to provide retraining and support
on the fifth of anniversary of the company's closing, winnie ng, who spearheaded the union effort to get the workers back on their feet, has written a comprehensive report about the lessons learned and the challenges that lie ahead as more """"racialized workers"""" face outsourcing, downsizing and restructuring the long-time labour activist and educator, who currently holds the caw-sam gindin chair in social justice at ryerson university, calls her -page post-mortem """"a tribute to the resilience and resistance of the former pmp (progressive moulded products) workers who were robbed of their jobs, severance compensation and sense of security and pride as contributing members of the community""""
the study's principal finding: people who have lived in this country for half of their lives - and are assumed by policy-makers to be fully integrated immigrants - are """"worse than when they came"""" if they lose their job that is why ng called the report immigrant all over again?
when the victims of the pmp shutdown re-entered the employment market, they faced racial discrimination, gender discrimination and age discrimination even with retraining, most of them failed to secure full-time jobs many ended up in temporary, casual or intermittent work some are still unemployed seventy-seven per cent now earn less than they did when the plant closed half are in worse health
unlike newcomers to canada, they had no access to immigrant settlement programs (which include language upgrading, help finding affordable housing, setting up a business and seeking work) unlike the graduates pouring out of ontario's colleges and universities, they were neither young nor canadian-educated (although half the pmp workers did have post-secondary training)
compared to other immigrants who lost their jobs in the recession, the pmp workers were lucky they were eligible for employment insurance benefits they had canadian work experience and they had a workers action centre to connect them to retraining programs and social services and help them make the transition to new employment but none of these advantages was enough to compensate for their skin colour, their age or their accented english
""""there is a strong narrative that poverty is simply a newcomer phenomenon this discourse holds that we were all immigrants once and that, over time, we will catch up,"""" said salmaan khan, a member of the research team """"from what we have recorded throughout this project, many workers living here for more than - years still find themselves living in precarity on the margins of society for these workers there never was a 'canadian dream' """"
the study's policy recommendations are its weakest aspect some are utopian - a $-per-hour minimum wage - and some have been rejected repeatedly: an overhaul of federal bankruptcy legislation; an expansion of ei coverage; improved childcare
but the doubts it raises about how well immigrants really do in this country are eye-opening and directly relevant to canada's future

Malhi will present a new challenge. As a turbaned Sikh, he could be up against a standing order which requires members to remove headgear when speaking in the House of Commons. Archaic rule, but don't discount some antediluvian Reform MP challenging Malhi's right to speak.","however you cut it, it was the """"ethnic vote"""" that clinched the liberal victory and thus gave canada a longer lease on life
were it not for the heavily ethnic ridings, the bloc quebecois and reform party would have completely dominated quebec and english- speaking canada respectively we would now be hammering out a separation agreement
smug patriotism aside, though, minorities will still be on the fringe in ottawa nobody in the nation's capital seems to hear the cry that minorities want in - not the political big wigs, the senior bureaucrats or the media
but now there are some fairly competent minority mps who could begin to change things, some who have spent many years involved in fighting for the rights of minorities:
* one of jean chretien's senior ministers is likely to be sergio marchi, a nine-year house of commons veteran who has high recognition among italian canadians and other minorities resulting from his tenacious defence of multicultural and immigration issues he is a senior party strategist and a dyed-in-the-wool chretien loyalist
* sheila finestone, from pierre trudeau's old riding of mount royal, has done well as the culture critic and is well regarded in the cultural community as well as in the canadian jewish community
* and don't pass by rey pagtakhan from winnipeg, the liberal health critic since , a specialist in lung disease and cystic fibrosis, who has headed the filipino canadian national organization and there's alfonso gagliano, a low-key mp from montreal who is well versed in small business issues and also is a long-time chretien loyalist
an old-pro like chretien likely is a believer in having experienced ministers, so don't expect too many rookies in cabinet among the new mps, the few lucky ones could include:
* hedy fry, who won a tough fight against kim campbell in vancouver centre born in trinidad, she has been president of the bc medical association and active in the women's movement in the liberal party
* eleni bakopanos from montreal is a lawyer of greek origin, well connected in the quebec liberal party and government, where she has worked for the past  years she also is well in tune with ethnic communities in her province
* jean augustine (etobicoke lakeshore), although a newcomer to politics, has proven management ability as a school principal and head of the metro toronto housing authority she also has been an activist in the black community
there are many others who could make a difference in ottawa:
* maria minna from beaches woodbine, a management consultant, has been president of the national congress of italian canadians and has worked extensively for immigrant settlement services
* ovid jackson from bruce-grey, one of the few blacks ever to be a mayor in canada, has been active in community issues relating to police services as well as race relations
* anna terrana from vancouver south has been active in the italian canadian community and headed the influential vancouver multicultural society
* jagdish bhaduria from markham, is an indian-born lawyer and activist in matters relating to legal aid, race relations and employment equity
* there will be two sikhs, herb dhaliwal, a smart and articulate lawyer from vancouver south, and gurbax malhi, a relative newcomer to politics malhi will present a new challenge as a turbaned sikh, he could be up against a standing order which requires members to remove headgear when speaking in the house of commons archaic rule, but don't discount some antediluvian reform mp challenging malhi's right to speak
among the other parties, the only star seems to be ozvaldo nunez of the bloc quebecois he is a chilean-born union executive who has been active with the latin american and haitian communities in quebec
while reform has some minorities of european origins, they likely are to be the real women of the ethnic movement - generally not advocates of minority rights (ironically, their views on multiculturalism are shared by liberal john nunziata)
the election saw some losses: conservative multiculturalism minister gerry weiner was soundly trounced, which should be a lesson to those who would use multiculturalism funds to manipulate minorities politically the big loss to parliament was new democrat howard mccurdy, the only black in the last parliament and a fearless defender of minority rights
by virtue of their numbers and experience, the minority mps have the ability to rebuff the reform party's marginalization tactics, which are becoming so acceptable
identifying with one's ethnic origin does not undermine patriotism, nor does the desire to fight for one's rights
while addressing all economic and social issues, these mps have both the duty and the moral authority to push hard on the multicultural and human rights agenda, knowing that their vision is central to the canadian identity

""""i don't do no job, no nothing,"""" he says in a gravelly voice """"so i decide to come here""""
karlis's quiet suburban home in ottawa is filled with evidence of the family's immigrant past in the foyer, framed letters from prime ministers and a governor general congratulate nicholas on  years in canada and  years of marriage to ionna
downstairs, nicholas's son george proudly points to a plaque framing his father's ticket on the argentine next to the ticket, a handsome young man in a cotton shirt smiles out from a black-and-white greek passport
george, who has his father's eyes, points to a quote on the plaque
""""in all our pasts is an immigrant beginning,"""" he reads
the karlises' story is familiar from irish merchants to ukrainian farmers, canada's history books are filled with tales of immigrants who braved poverty, prejudice and frozen terrain to make canada their home but in recent years, canada's immigration policy has made it harder for people like the karlises to arrive with nothing and build a life here
citizenship and immigration canada has not upped its immigration targets in seven years and has adjusted the application process to focus more on finding people who already fit into mainstream canadian society through education, language or culture as stories like the karlises' become few and far between, a new immigration narrative emerges: my own
at the border of highgate springs, vt, and st armand, que, everything changes the landscape begins to transform almost immediately after passing border security, as if geography had a nationality the rolling mountains of vermont become the flat farmland of quebec, where miles are measured in metres and warehouselike strip clubs advertise """"danseurs erotique""""
i have travelled this borderland many times over the past nine years since i moved to canada in  i, like many other americans, was on my way to mcgill university to take advantage of the relatively cheap tuition i, unlike karlis, had with me a student visa, high-school-level french, suitcases filled with tank tops, a paper lantern my sister had given me and a pastry blender i had packed it all in duffel bags, shoved it into my parent's saturn station wagon in boston and headed for the border what i didn't know is that with every border crossing the line within me between canada and america would get more blurred
when i moved to canada in , i hadn't intended to make it my home i wasn't escaping poverty or war; i was just looking for a bachelor of arts degree but the longer i stayed the more ties to the country i made i met my fiance david when i was  at a dive bar in montreal one of his friends knew one of my friend's friends, and we clicked in the kind of magical, immediate way you can when you're young and wasted
i think we talked about the english painter hogarth, because i was a pretentious drunk and taking an th-century lit class david was an art student at concordia and liked the etchings of william blake he had dreamy dark eyes and i gave him my number
by the time i graduated from mcgill in , i knew i was in love but i also knew that i'd have to be the one to make the move david, like many canadians, shows his patriotism not with parades but with his unwillingness to live anywhere else
immigrating for love is hardly new ionna came to canada from athens a few years after karlis they had met when they were only , and he promised to bring her to canada as his wife
""""i was thinking about it, lots of times, and i dream lots of times,"""" ionna remembers, her wide eyes looking past me
back then, the easiest way to immigrate was as a sponsored spouse but in the last few years, cic has changed its priorities rather than recruit people based on familial ties, canada now seeks immigrants with an economic connection to canada
in , the year i graduated from mcgill, cic created the canadian experience class program to recruit immigrants like myself, who have canadian education and work experience since then, the program has accepted more than , new immigrants, and its targets are increasing
meanwhile, cic has slashed refugee health services, lowered targets for skilled worker class immigration and made family sponsorships more difficult rather than welcome lower-skilled immigrants to canada permanently, the government allows those jobs to be filled by temporary foreign workers who are then sent packing
i've seen many of these changes first-hand while most of them have worked for my benefit, i fear that it's getting harder and harder to immigrate to canada no matter who you are, and i can't help but worry about what canada, the nation i have come to love, will lose in the process
over the past few years, i've learned that canadians are fiercely proud of their multiculturalism good left-leaning students at mcgill often told me that canada is a """"cultural mosaic"""" while america is a """"melting pot"""" i didn't need a canadian-english dictionary to figure out which one was regarded as better
i don't exactly read """"immigrant"""" i'm white and well spoken when people find out i'm from boston, my lack of accent usually shocks """"where do you paaahhhk your caahhh?"""" drunken canadians like to demand of me
to an extent, my ability to blend in has helped me see through some of canada's polite veneer during a dinner with friends, when i was living in montreal, someone offhandedly complained about the immigrants in quebec who refuse to learn french
""""but i'm an immigrant,"""" i quietly remind them
""""oh, but you're not that kind of immigrant,"""" they tell me
it's funny how often i've heard that phrase although i may not look and sound like what most people think an immigrant does, i went through the oftentimes obtuse process of immigrating to canada i had to have language tests (yes, even though english is my first language) and background checks, notarized forms and detailed letters from every past employer it took me about two years and $,, but i finally made canada my home
on nov , , i piled into my friend gemma's station wagon and drove  kilometres to ogdensburg, ny, to finally become a permanent resident of canada
every day, , people cross the canada-us border, but in  only , americans immigrated permanently to canada since the north american free trade agreement was signed in , americans have been able to process their immigration papers at a canadian port of entry by simply crossing over into the us and turning back around
border crossings are, by nature, liminal territory for the , ,  minutes you wait in line, you are not quite in canada, not quite in america at the us border, the american security guard eyed my friend and me suspiciously: were we friend or foe?
""""passports please,"""" he drawled
we relinquished our documents, our only proof that we were legitimate citizens of somewhere scanning my blue passport, he narrowed his eyes
""""are you asian?"""" he asked
i stuttered """"no""""
""""you look asian in this photo,"""" he said suspiciously
like most passport photos, mine is terrible the lighting is off, washing me out and giving my hair a strange strawberry glow the image is overexposed, making my round face dimensionless, my eyes crinkled in a smile
despite the fact that i had an american passport, the guard hemmed and hawed before letting me into my own country, only relenting after giving me strict orders to turn right around and go back to canada, no loitering in the us please
on the canadian side, i was met with a mere chuckle
""""this photo doesn't look anything like you!"""" the friendly canuck said before stamping my passport and welcoming me to the country
being an ex-american is like being an ex-girlfriend i love america and always will but in its own way, it broke my heart and i don't think i can ever take it back when i moved the canada, it was at the height of the bush administration and i was sick to death of all the damned stupidity i had believed in america like children believe in the easter bunny
but that america wasn't real the guy who gets the most votes doesn't always get into office and the city that never sleeps can go dark in an instant after a terrorist attack
when nicholas karlis moved to canada from greece in , he escaped a life of poverty and war although he found prosperity for himself and his family, he never ever forgot how quickly one could lose everything
that's why karlis and his generation made such good immigrants they built this country so that they could have the life they wanted their stories have become legends that their sons and daughters tell their own children
but while karlis's immigrant experience taught him the importance of building a home, mine taught me the transience of it what story will i tell my canadian-american children?
that your national identity means more than just where you're born, and borders are just lines drawn on a map - until you cross them

436903954,Christianity branches out:   [SA2 Edition ],"The church was first established for a predominantly Irish congregation. But as the Irish became more economically settled, they moved to other areas. In 1908, the church was renamed Our Lady of Mount Carmel and became Toronto first Italian national parish. By 1965, it had become a Portuguese parish, and by 1970, it was Korean and Chinese. The Korean population moved on and today it serves a predominantly Chinese population. Father Joseph O'Neill, a Roman Catholic historian, estimates that only 25 per cent of the 258 diocesan priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese share the ethnic origins of the early settlers. Many are from immigrant families who arrived in Toronto after World War II. Others were ordained outside Canada but have come to serve in Toronto. Leadership positions within the clergy are also slowly beginning to change. The 1990 appointment of Most Rev. Aloysius Ambrozic as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto marked the end of a long line of archbishops of Irish heritage. Ambrozic came to Canada as an immigrant shortly after World War II and became a priest of the diocese in 1955.","in , when muddy york became toronto, the vast majority of settlers were white, english-speaking christians, divided into four denominations
generally speaking, anglicans and methodists were anglo-irish or english presbyterians were irish or scottish roman catholics were irish or french
a century and a half later, archbishop michael peers, primate of the anglican church of canada, described toronto as """"a city of ethnic neighborhoods    one of the most multicultural cities in the world every ethnic group here, including the english one to which i belong, is a minority""""
christianity in toronto has become multilingual, multiracial and multidenominational the city also has become home to groups representing all the major religious faiths of the world
each wave of immigration brought new people whose need for spiritual sustenance pushed the churches into finding a variety of ways to provide pastoral aid
the earlier waves brought primarily european christians later, immigrants came from asia, latin america and africa some among these brought with them christian traditions more ancient than the north american ones others brought a younger, more vibrant christianity developed with missionaries in their countries
the christian denominations of toronto in  are still prominent, but they too have changed over the years the anglican church offers worship in six languages, the united church (the descendants of the methodists) in nine languages and the presbyterian church in  the roman catholic mass is celebrated each week in  languages
many local congregations today reflect more than one ethnic group and hold services in two or more languages in some areas, specific ethnic congregations have become large enough to require a church dedicated to their own language some are new churches but many are older, built originally for an english-speaking congregation
our lady of mount carmel roman catholic church, on st patrick st, is an example of how one inner-city parish has reacted to various population shifts
the church was first established for a predominantly irish congregation but as the irish became more economically settled, they moved to other areas in , the church was renamed our lady of mount carmel and became toronto first italian national parish by , it had become a portuguese parish, and by , it was korean and chinese the korean population moved on and today it serves a predominantly chinese population
several united and presbyterian churches have facilities shared by two groups but they also offer examples of major ethnic population shifts
armour heights united has become onnuri united and high park alhambra united is now hanuhl united both serve korean congregations glebe road united has a german-speaking congregation and centennial united serves a predominantly japanese congregation
the anglican parishes of st christopher on the heights and st elizabeth have mainly chinese congregations in several other parishes, anglicans of korean, japanese, tamil and caribbean backgrounds share facilities with canada more traditional anglican congregations
most denominations have established a person or an office to oversee multicultural activities and promote better understanding among both clergy and lay members
in order to build bridges and community solidarity, many parishes and congregations hold events such as international suppers and festivals these help various groups in the community come to know and understand each other
the arrival of new groups also has had a profound impact on the training and recruitment of clergy increasingly, ministers and priests are being drawn from diverse ethnic backgrounds
toronto anglican parishes, for example, have  priests of asian, caribbean and other non-european backgrounds almost  per cent of the active clergy in the united church toronto conference are of non-anglo-saxon heritage in the presbyterian church, the ratio is closer to one-third
father joseph o'neill, a roman catholic historian, estimates that only  per cent of the  diocesan priests in the roman catholic archdiocese share the ethnic origins of the early settlers many are from immigrant families who arrived in toronto after world war ii others were ordained outside canada but have come to serve in toronto
leadership positions within the clergy are also slowly beginning to change the  appointment of most rev aloysius ambrozic as roman catholic archbishop of toronto marked the end of a long line of archbishops of irish heritage ambrozic came to canada as an immigrant shortly after world war ii and became a priest of the diocese in 
from  to , rev sang chul lee served as moderator of the united church of canada he came to canada in  as an immigrant from south korea and served in the toronto conference from  until his retirement in 
the provision of multilingual worship and other pastoral services has not come about without tension and debate within all denominations, there has been resistance to change from some church members, especially among those groups whose ancestors built the local churches
some just do not like the changes others say they result in linguistic ghettos and don't help immigrants to become assimilated into the canadian culture most, however, believe that the churches must provide these services for the very practical reason that the newcomers often cannot manage in english
within immigrant groups themselves, many do not want to establish separate congregations but they see linguistic services as a necessary help during their early period in canada others feel that having their own linguistic parishes helps to preserve their culture and pass on their heritage to the next generation
""""the church often serves a double role for people when they first arrive in canada,"""" says the united church sang chul lee """"they need a community to help them feel at home and to provide assistance, so the church serves both as a community centre and a place of worship
""""eventually the process leads the newcomers to learn what contribution they can make to the larger toronto society, in ways that still value their own culture yet move them more deeply into the new culture""""
no church has one simple answer for dealing with these new situations ways to meet the challenges and opportunities they present are constantly under study at both the local and national level
in his address to the  general synod of the anglican church, archbishop peers stressed the importance of toronto many cultures learning to live together """"we all live together as a sort of multicultural experiment it is a real symbol of what is happening and has happened in canada, particularly over the past  years if the experiment works here, then perhaps it can work elsewhere but, if it fails here, it will be an ominous sign for the rest of the country""""

it dawned on the dutch that race relations just had to be improved to reduce domestic tensions, make jobless non-white youth more productive and less crime-prone, and also to attract high-end immigrants
meanwhile, holland's  million muslims, stung by what was being said of their faith, realized they couldn't remain aloof
""""society had defined muslims as foreigners and many then defined themselves as foreigners,"""" said haci karacaer, head of a dutch turkish group """"many dutch turks would fly to ankara to vote but wouldn't walk  metres here to cast their ballot""""

she had to resign as an mp after her citizenship was placed in doubt she has just had it restored - but not her credibility
the controversy also exposed the hypocrisy of the right-wing national coalition government
immigration minister rita verdonk has been deporting people who had similarly lied their way into holland she felt she couldn't make an exception for a colleague now she has
the """"iron lady"""" has had to backtrack on other fronts as well she had to acknowledge the reality of workplace discrimination employers keen on applicants speaking fluent dutch on the phone have been shown to lose interest upon hearing their surnames or seeing them in person
a shocking national poll showed that a tenth of the dutch admit to being racist and another  per cent admit to being racist on occasion, especially against muslims
verdonk has been forced to backtrack on a bill that would subject , immigrants and the , foreign-born citizens to a test on dutch language and customs it will now apply only to the first group
she is also under intense pressure to resolve the issue of nearly , refugee claimants held in limbo in nine camps
the dutch refugee council's long-standing call for amnesty got a boost when the association of municipalities asked her to grant resident permits to those in holland for five years
the government has been forced to open a dialogue with muslims """"earlier, it only spoke about muslims but not with muslims,"""" said mp coskun coruz it will no longer insist on herding muslims into one group to speak with one tame voice
overall, """"the country has calmed down,"""" said a recent editorial in boom, a downtown amsterdam magazine
i asked job cohen, the eminently sensible mayor of amsterdam, if the pendulum is swinging back to the middle

the granting of citizenship is a right that cannot be denied for any reason other than what is spelled out in the law, which states ``the minister shall grant citizenship'' to any person  and over who meets normal eligibility conditions and basically this relates to canadian residence, police screening and having an adequate knowledge of english or french and about canada in general thus, being a wife deserter and an irresponsible father is not a barrier to citizenship

1912261400,Overt racism still shock-worthy,Aucun(e) disponible.,"a woman's racist rant at a mississauga doctor's clinic aroused widespread horror among canadians this week, after they watched her demand - in front of her young child - a white doctor who spoke english and didn't have brown teeth
overt racism still shocks people, especially those who don't experience racism themselves while easy to castigate such offensiveness, this vulgar display is nothing compared to the more serious aspects of racism racism - which breaks up families, cripples generations, keeps them impoverished and continues to have deadly consequences - is structural, systemic and largely invisible except to those who experience it
being affronted by this instance of racism in mississauga might signify individual decency, but does not meaningfully erase complicity with benefitting from racist structures
still, this is the shock wave of the moment, and openly demanding to see a white doctor is obviously racist
i wrote a column attempting to peel back another layer of bias inherent in seeking an english-speaking doctor when those at the clinic were already speaking english
hundreds of readers commented on it on social media and in my inbox some shared their own hurt of belittlement by fellow canadians
""""after moving to brantford, ont, in the early 's when i was released from the canadian armed forces,"""" said one email, """"i myself had a similar run-in with a nurse at our local hospital she apparently loved my dialect and thoughtit would be a great pastime to see if she could somehow guess where i was from after four to five attempts ranging from scottish to irish to south african, the nurse seemed enraged when my irish-born wife told her that i was a newfoundlander""""
from among those who found reason to disagree with my criticism of the saga, a few key themes emerged:
 """"why are you protecting this racist woman by blurring her face?""""
we are not we are attempting to protect the identity of her son, who is a minor
 """"to assume that the behaviour of an individual is indicative of widespread racism is completely ludicrous""""
welcome to the world of the non-woke i don't know whether to shake my head at the ignorance this statement carries or to be envious of the privilege it signifiesindividual acts of racism are the tip of the iceberg, but they offer some hope that they will force racism deniers to accept the obvious
someone said we need to give this woman a chance another said maybe she's fed up with the """"special treatment"""" other groups are receiving still others said she might have mental-health issues she might i don't know, but it's a particular weapon of the racism deniers, a benefit of the doubt afforded only to a select few, whether it's to the man who kills six people in a montreal mosque or one who kills nine black people praying in a charleston church
 """"like nobody else regardless of colour asks for a certain type of doctor?""""
others were more direct why do women get to ask for female doctors? is it sexist - and therefore discriminatory - to do so? there isn't an equivalence there asking for a white doctor assumes a doctor of another race would not be able to offer the quality of care required asking for a female doctor - and you get one only if available - has nothing to do with race nor does it mean male doctors are inadequate it's about comfort and about affording equal access to health care
 """"while i'm pleased that immigrant doctors are finding a place in our society, and pleased because in many cases they have the patience to listen to their patient, i find that their accents tend to get in the way of we who can't hear past the accent and therefore don't completely understand""""
everybody has an accent understanding it is a matter of exposure if what the doctor says genuinely sounds like garble, one can always politely request another practitioner or write down everything you think they are saying and show them so there is no misunderstanding
another person wrote to say she has a hearing problem """"and have great difficulty or cannot understand someone who has a significant accent i hope that in this situation, the request, on its own, for a doctor or other service provider who speaks without an accent would not automatically be considered to be racism""""
it wouldn't i would call that a request for accommodation
 """"i really can't see anything wrong with asking a person of colour where they are fromsame goes with the accenti love talking to people of different ethnic origins and find asking the question, 'which country are you from?' or 'what kind of an accent is that?' is a good conversation starter""""
you may love talking to people of different ethnic origins, if they are your friends if they are strangers, why do you assume they are eager to educate you on their exotic ways? just as """"how much do you earn?"""" is in poor taste, """"where do you come from?"""" can also come across as a crude effort to size up another's worth
new immigrants may not find the question offensivehowever, it is most often asked of those considered different by some yardstick or the other, who might have well been in canada all their adult lives or were born here or whose families have been here  years or - the worst transgression - if they are indigenous
at what point do they become """"canadian enough"""" to not be asked that question?

mr laverty notes that the budget is greater than that of the city of ottawa, which undergoes line-by-line public scrutiny of its budget
he added that the board's mandate to have one-third francophone representation is too high because only about  to  per cent of people in ottawa-carleton are french-speaking
political candidates at a public health forum yesterday agreed that hospital boards should become more accountable to the public

mr chopra, a health canada scientist, said the board does not have any members of visible minorities even though they represent  per cent of the population in ottawa-carleton
an organization called the visible minority healthcare network is lobbying the hospital to increase the number of people of colour on the board
the current ottawa hospital board was created out of sixteen board members who came from the three hospitals that amalgamated, and eight new directors
unity canada was formed by people who were enraged that the ottawa hospital board last year appointed mr levine, a former parti quebecois candidate, as executive director without public consultation
the group is also opposed to the increased bilingualism planned for the ottawa hospital """"it means francophones will get all the jobs,"""" said mr laverty

hospitals in ontario are covered by the public hospitals act and regulations teaching hospitals are classified in the regulations and the montfort is not included in them if it has been acting as a teaching hospital and not been classified as one then everyone who has contributed either directly or indirectly may be guilty of an offence
there is not one hospital in quebec that is as english as the ottawa general is french yet they are considered as english hospitals so there's even more reason to consider the general as a french hospital a little sizing up before making statements would help
maybe it is time the language commissioners attended to their mandate and worried about the great under- representation of anglophones in the federal public service in quebec compared to the treatment of anglophones in quebec, francophones in ontario are better treated than all other groups in ontario for example, they are employed in the ontario public service at roughly three times the proportion of persons who speak french in the home

2593676375,Report says uOttawa community must be willing to address sensitive topics in an academic context,Aucun(e) disponible.,"students and the community at the university of ottawa must be willing to address sensitive topics in an academic context, a committee set up by the university to look at academic freedom declared in a report on thursday
the report, which followed a scandal involving a professor's use of the n-word and another's """"quebec-bashing"""" tweets, was penned by a special committee set up to answer and analyze several questions, including what the limits of academic freedom - if any - should be
the committee, headed by former supreme court justice michel bastarache, based its report on consultations with university stakeholders and an in-depth analysis of canadian law in its report, the committee issued a strong defence of academic freedom
""""the committee is not in favour of institutional or self-censorship that is apt to compromise the dissemination of knowledge or is motivated by fear of public repudiation,"""" the report read """"the committee believes that students and the university community must be willing to address sensitive topics in an academic context""""
the report comes following a scandal where the limits of a professor's academic freedom were called into question by the university's students
it began when part-time professor verushka lieutenant-duval used the n-word during an art and gender class in september  students complained about her use of the term and she was suspended she was later reinstated and apologized for using the term, but the event was criticized by a group of francophone professors who penned an open letter in support of lieutenant-duval, claiming the term could be used in an academic context and that her academic freedom had been infringed
professors who shared their opinions publicly about lieutenant-duval reported facing online intimidation and cyberbullying
while the academic freedom report weighed in strongly in favour of professors' rights to teach sensitive material despite student discomfort, it did note that """"providing advance notice of topics deemed sensitive by some students may be expedient in certain cases to ensure they are not caught off-guard""""
but some faculty who spoke to the committee members said they felt ill-equipped to broach issues involving diversity and inclusion and lacked the resources to do so the report recommended the establishment of a diversity and inclusion training program and a personal consultation service for staff to provide guidance around those issues
the report also recommended the university create a standing committee to """"review and implement the policy on academic freedom and freedom of expression"""" and noted a need to """"establish norms of conduct applicable to students, faculty and other university staff and measures prohibiting cyberbullying""""
president and vice-chancellor jacques frémont said the university would work to adopt the committee's recommendations he said the report provided useful context and discussion around critical issues that all north american universities are struggling to balance: how to maintain the university as a place where all ideas and thoughts can be discussed while making it a diverse place where all students feel safe and welcome
""""if there was a silver bullet in this matter, we would have found it north american universities would have found it we're all struggling with the same issues,"""" frémont said in an interview
""""we give more than , courses every year the vast majority of these courses, there are no problems whatsoever there might be a few courses (with issues), and these are a few courses too many, but we have to deal with these courses because important issues and principles are at stake""""
in march , six months after lieutenant-duval's use of the n-word, another university of ottawa professor, amir attaran, used his personal twitter account to call the quebec government """"white supremacist"""" and said quebec was the """"alabama of the north""""
asked about attaran's tweets, prime minister justin trudeau said it was """"quebec bashing"""" and representatives in quebec's legislature - and many in the francophone quebec media - were outraged by the tweets and by what they saw as a double-standard: lieutenant-duval was suspended for using the n-word in an academic context, while attaran was able to tweet criticism of quebec with impunity
but thurday's report ventured little into professors' actions beyond the walls of the university""""our first concern is more with academic freedom on campus, in the classrooms,"""" frémont said
controlling professors' statements made outside of an academic context was a prickly issue, he added, and the larger issue of freedom of speech on social media and the internet was one that society as a whole was concerned with, not just universities",The Ottawa Citizen,2021-11-04,2021,11,4

however, the french lettering will have to be twice as large as the lettering in other languages, claude ryan said
merchants will be free to ''use their imagination'' in interpreting the provision, which will be the ''minimum'' quebec will accept, claude ryan told reporters
''but we're not going to measure signs with a ruler,'' he added
the regulation also stipulates that other characteristics such as color and lighting must not reduce the visual impact of the french text

ryan rejected suggestions that the regulation, which will not become law for at least two more months, will be a nightmare to enforce
''you don't need much refinement to see if a thing is twice as big as another,'' he said ''it's as simple as can be a five-year-old child can understand that''
ryan said he has had no indication from the quebec justice department that the regulation will be impossible to implement
but parti quebecois leader jacques parizeau challenged the government to create a parliamentary commission to study the legal implications of the ''two-for-one'' provision
''otherwise, we could be in for an avalanche of lawsuits for years to come,'' parizeau said
jean dorion, head of the nationalist st-jean-baptiste society, blasted the regulation, which also provides for all indoor signs which are visible from the outside to be in french only
''it's a very bad signal to send out to immigrants that signs can be in english,'' dorion said in an interview from montreal
dorion insists the government should have maintained the previous language law, which allowed bilingual signs inside stores with four or fewer employees
clifford lincoln, one of three anglophones who quit the provincial cabinet last december to protest bourassa's language law, said the regulation is just one part of a bad law
''once you deny the principle of external signs, which was the basis of the (government's) judgment, then you start with a flawed principle''
karen lochhead, president of english-rights group outaouais alliance, said the new rules would only create further tension in an already frustrating situation
''it's ludicrous the lengths to which the quebec government has gone to discredit english in order to promote french,'' she said ''this only adds insult to injury''
asked whether canadians won't find the regulation incredible, ryan replied that they will tell themselves that ''quebeckers always astonish us they always come out of the depth of a crisis with renewed vigor''
quebeckers have  days to send ryan their views on the regulation it will then be returned to the provincial cabinet, which will decide whether to make it law

""""we can't wait for a mass retirement to happen at all these levels for us to really begin seeing the value of diversity and inclusion in industries and public sectors and council,"""" nour hachem-fawaz, the leader of the just-created diversity and inclusion task force, said tuesday after a zoom meeting with ahmed hussen, federal minister of families, children and social development also participating was mp irek kusmierczyk (l - windsor-tecumseh)
the """"incredible"""" diversity in windsor-tecumseh is a strength of our region, kusmierczyk said in a tuesday news release """"i enthusiastically look forward to working with the diversity and inclusion task force to help our community fully tap into that strength and today's meeting with minister hussen - the first somali-canadian to be elected as a member of parliament - brings forward a key ally to our important work in windsor-essex""""
why is it there's not a person of colour on council? why is there only one female on council?
the task force is comprised of community leaders from a multitude of cultures who seek to create a diverse and inclusive community, with equity at all levels, according to hachem-fawaz, who leads build a dream, an organization that supports women in male-dominated industries but who has noticed similar underrepresentation for indigenous youth, black youth and newcomers to canada she described the task force as a """"unified, collective approach to creating change""""
the city of windsor already has a diversity committee but hachem-fawaz said it will take a grassroots effort to raise some of the difficult questions that need answering
""""why is it there's not a person of colour on council? why is there only one female on council? what happens when unrepresented groups run for council? how may of them are actually running?""""
she said that every election, the low representation of women and people of colour becomes an after-the-fact issue with the next municipal election more than two years away, now's the time to set targets and map out paths to reach them, she suggested
""""we won't wait until the next election to ask why is it we didn't get another woman on council, or why we didn't get someone of colour on council""""
hachem-fawaz said the boards of public institutions should reflect the people who make up the community """"look at publicly funded institutions, look at their boards and look at their leadership teams,"""" she said """"you will not see much diversity""""
and """"representation matters,"""" she added """"you can't be what you can't see""""
while these leadership roles have little diversity locally,  per cent of windsor's population are newcomers, with more than  cultures present one out of every four residents in windsor-essex is an immigrant between  and , , newcomers came to windsor-essex to make it their home
""""with such staggering statistics, why aren't more people of colour represented in leadership roles in business, organizations and government,"""" the task force asks, citing high unemployment rates for black canadians compared to white canadians windsor-essex also ranks as one of canada's most challenging places for women, with women making up only  per cent of elected officials, and  per cent of senior managers, the task force says only  per cent of women are employed and  per cent of women are living in poverty
""""it's at all levels that we're trying to initiate a different approach, that can really amplify the voices of those that have been significantly underrepresented,"""" hachem-fawaz said

1419043898,"Put people, not GDP, first","For decades, our immigration policy included family reunification as one of the core principles which recognized that united families lead to successful community integration and economic strength.","  citizenship and immigration canada (cic) is currently consulting the public on canada's future immigration plan very few canadians know about this, and even fewer may participate given the consultation design and the questions posed by cic, perhaps that should not be a surprise
some call it cliche while others call it irrefutable fact: our country has been and will continue to be built by immigrants
from economic prosperity to social harmony, the well-being of canada and its people are intrinsically linked to both our immigration policy and the way immigrants are treated in this country
yet immigration is forever a subject of polarized debate on the one hand, with the aging population and ever declining birth rate, many canadians - economists and demographers among them - are calling for a significant increase in immigration intakes on the other side of the debate are those - including some newcomers - arguing for a decline or even a complete halt of immigration in light of the current unemployment rates and the persistent underutilization of immigrants' talents and skills
where we stand on immigration is a reflection of who we are as a nation
for decades, our immigration policy included family reunification as one of the core principles which recognized that united families lead to successful community integration and economic strength
as a signatory to the  un convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees, canada has also opened its door to countless refugees fleeing persecution from around the globe
however, canada's history is also replete with deliberate and racist measures to exclude those whom canadians deem undesirable
for a national consultation on immigration planning to be meaningful, canadians need to know all the relevant facts and consider the multi-purpose roles of immigration policy - a notion captured by the concept of nation-building immigration planning must not simply be understood as an economic imperative
but that is precisely what the government wants us to do in this consultation
cic background material and its online survey demonstrate a clear bias toward economic-class immigrants, touting their virtues and promoting their numbers at the expense of family-class immigrants and refugees the consultation questions are designed to illicit favourable responses regarding economic immigrants, while downplaying the importance of the other two categories of immigrants
for instance, when describing factors to consider in immigration planning, the backgrounder equates integration of immigrants with """"economic success,"""" contrasting them with """"refugees and other immigrants with poor health"""" who rely on government support to integrate
the backgrounder makes it abundantly clear that the government's priority is to use immigration to support canada's economy while there is nothing wrong with this objective, it is the short-sightedness and bias with which the government is approaching this goal that needs to be challenged
equally alarming have been many changes to a number of specific economic pathways that have given unprecedented influence to employers to determine which newcomers will ultimately be granted permanent residency status
for example, the canadian experience class, the live-in-caregiver program, and the foreign skilled worker program all grant employers a significant role in what really is the job of the nation - determining who can acquire citizenship for canada as a country to succeed, we need immigrants of all backgrounds and skills to come here to build a permanent home
for immigrants to succeed, they need to have a sense of belonging that only comes about when their entire families are integrated into canadian society
and contrary to what the consultation paper may suggest, our government has an important role to play in helping immigrants successfully integrate policies and programs that deal with systemic discrimination faced by racialized immigrants in the labour market, and adequate funding for immigration settlement programs are measures that should be part and parcel of any rational immigration plan
finally, any discussion around our future immigration plan is incomplete if it does not also include a soul-searching exercise of who we are as a people, and the values we choose to embrace if canada is just about protecting economic interests, and the only use of immigrants is to further that goal, then we should make that clear - both to ourselves and to the people we are inviting to join us but surely, there is more to canada than our gdp
the cic consultation will come to an end on aug  participate tell the new immigration minister we need a more balanced mix of immigration, and demand a fuller debate about canada's immigration plan

is """"profiling"""" wrong? or is it a legitimate instrument in both the war on terrorism and criminal investigations? though profiling has its limits and must be used intelligently, we think it's legitimate
to be sure, there is no justification for """"profiling"""" that is motivated by prejudice toward a group but that is not what either us immigration authorities or the toronto police department are engaged in
american security officials question people based on intelligence information that there are potential terrorists on the loose, and that so far a high proportion of them belong to an identifiable ethnic or religious group with a declared intent to hurt the west this does not imply that all members of that group are terrorists; it merely recognizes that many terrorists have been from that group to ignore this would be irresponsible mr mistry may find it objectionable that his appearance subjects him to extra questioning, but better this than the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of others (including, possibly, others of his own ethnic background)
similarly, toronto police would be negligent if they ignored statistics demonstrating that young black men are involved in a disproportionate amount of crime the toronto star has pointed out that blacks account for about  per cent of arrests for violent crimes even though they make up only eight per cent of the city's population sweeping judgments aren't acceptable; one person's conduct is not necessarily indicative of the behaviour of other members of his or her group nonetheless, profiling is a statistically based tool that helps police focus their limited resources

[Jan Imeson] works for a company that moved from Toronto to Halifax this year. Clark Inc. was a transportation company based in Concord. Now, it is a holding company based in Halifax. Imeson, 48, is the executive vice-president and chief financial officer. She says she would not have returned to Toronto to take the job and was only willing to work for Clark if the company planned to move here. Halifax may have an unemployment rate below 6 per cent, but unemployment in Cape Breton is more than twice that. In fact, many areas of rural Nova Scotia still struggle with double-digit unemployment rates. But even in Cape Breton, the trend has been positive recently, with unemployment rates slowly dropping.","jan imeson moved here from toronto nine years ago, eager to dump high mortgage payments and stubborn traffic jams for a mellower way of life
new statistics show that imeson was on the leading edge of a wave that has boosted the nova scotia economy and drawn immigrants and businesses here from around the world
statistics canada reported last week that nova scotia unemployment rate dipped to  per cent in may, its lowest figure in  years the story in the region biggest city was even better
halifax beat toronto in the all-important jobs sweepstakes, with a  per cent unemployment rate, compared to  per cent in toronto
""""the unemployment rate is lower in halifax than in toronto, ottawa or london,"""" boasted nova scotia premier john hamm
""""i'm very proud of what we've achieved we are gradually turning things around; this is not just a blip""""
statistics seem to back him up
nova scotia, like other atlantic provinces, has spent a generation battling the twin evils of unemployment and out- migration as the pillars of its traditional resource economy - forestry and fish - faltered
but that story has started to change nova scotia unemployment rate has been falling steadily for three years perhaps more impressive is the fact that jobs are being created in the absence of flashy new industries or government-sponsored mega-projects there are no huge construction projects going on to artificially inflate employment numbers, as when new navy ships were being built in saint john, nb, or the hibernia oil platform was being assembled in newfoundland
the job surge has also occurred as the oil and gas industry contracted the energy sector was once touted as the future of the region, but exploration has been disappointing in recent years and several companies have pulled out
it seems to be small business, call centres and high-tech enterprises that are creating the jobs ten years ago, there were just , small businesses in nova scotia today, there are more than ,
hamm credits low costs and a great lifestyle for the jobs boom in nova scotia he points out that his hometown, pictou, was rated the most cost-effective place to establish a new business in canada by one consulting firm in another survey, halifax was rated the fourth best place on the planet to set up business
stephen lund is president of nova scotia business inc, a provincial agency created to lure business to the province
he says lower costs and better lifestyles are not only sparking new business creation but luring established businesses from other places, including toronto
registercom, of new york, is one of the largest internet registration companies in the world it has decided to consolidate its international operations in yarmouth in the southwestern tip of the province the software company versata is in the process of moving its engineering operation here from india
imeson works for a company that moved from toronto to halifax this year clark inc was a transportation company based in concord now, it is a holding company based in halifax imeson, , is the executive vice-president and chief financial officer she says she would not have returned to toronto to take the job and was only willing to work for clark if the company planned to move here
she says the company decided to move to halifax so that its executives could concentrate on work, rather than being distracted by the hassles of big-city life
""""i have nothing against toronto, i grew up there, but it is just so hectic,"""" she says
""""you want your people to be paying attention to the company and its vision, not high mortgage payments or whether they can get through the traffic to pick their children up at daycare on time""""
hamm has offered payroll rebates to entice many companies to the region, but few companies have received more than $ million from provincial coffers
another key to the province new success, lund says, is a restructured community college system that has focused on producing workers with the right skills
brian lee crowley is president of the atlantic institute of market studies, an east coast think tank he agrees that the community college system is key to nova scotia economic renewal but worries that it may not be able to keep up with the demands of the boom
""""we will hit labour shortages soon,"""" he predicts
crowley has long complained that atlantic canada was caught in a vicious cycle in which badly structured government support programs depressed the economy he believes the region is finally emerging from that, and is headed toward a """"virtuous cycle"""" that will create a """"culture of opportunity""""
""""we are starting, slowly, to get our act together,"""" he says """"often, it is not one thing but  small things that make the difference""""
not all areas of the province have benefited equally from the boom
halifax may have an unemployment rate below  per cent, but unemployment in cape breton is more than twice that in fact, many areas of rural nova scotia still struggle with double-digit unemployment rates but even in cape breton, the trend has been positive recently, with unemployment rates slowly dropping
the  per cent provincial unemployment rate """"is just a snapshot,"""" lund says """"it a good number, but there is lots of work to be done""""

lastman said he would prefer to employ north york students, but would take applicants from all across metro
applicants must be enrolled in a full-time university program and have good grades and good leadership skills application deadline is march 
harry mccabe, manager of employment at ibm canada ltd, said his company is happy to take part in the program he said ibm hopes to hire two or three students in a few months in finance, programming, engineering or administration
""""they must have the appropriate education or work experience,"""" mccabe said """"we're putting a lot of faith in black students doing well in school and hope they can be good role models""""

the ontario human rights commission took  months to approve the program because it was targeted at one minority group, lastman said it relented when it """"recognized this is a special group that needs extra assistance""""

""""we need this kind of affirmative action to get them (blacks) meaningful jobs,"""" wright said, adding that blacks as a group have limited access to these type of jobs
both the employers and the black students will be able to see each other and determine whether they suit each other's needs, wright added
to qualify, students must be enrolled in a full-time program, must have good grades, leadership ability and a letter of reference from a college dean or university professor
students must also submit a brief essay saying why they should be selected exceptional grade  students will also be considered north york will act as a clearing house for the applications and steer the students to the appropriate job, lastman said

in the multicultural melange that is marilyn harvey grade  class, some children are learning the alphabet while others are reading books
she has refugee children from bosnia, from ukraine, and from somalia along with students who were born in canada but came to school without a word of english
that typical for connaught public school on gladstone avenue, where more than half the children have a first language that is neither english nor french
it a striking example of how canada immigration policy has changed school across the country, especially in cities
canada has dramatically increased immigration levels in the last five years, bringing a flood of children into schools who speak neither english nor french
it led to a crisis as school boards struggle to provide language training and services to immigrant children
the influx has coincided with restraint the federal government increased immigration, but refuses to fund english-as-a-second-language (esl) training for children, saying education is a provincial responsibility
provinces don't pick up the full cost of esl either some provinces, including ontario, provide partial grants to schools the poorer provinces contribute nothing
school boards say they are left to struggle with the consequences some, facing budget restraints, have cut language training
children are the losers, they complain
immigrants fear their children may emerge from schools without an adequate grasp of their new language
""""in the long term, there no question in my mind that what we're doing is knowingly creating an underclass that is based on immigrant status and largely on race because a lot of people who are coming in now are non-white, charged andrew cardozo, a member of a local group called the esl support coalition
and some non-immigrant parents worry that classroom teachers trying to help students learn a new language will have less time for their children, and standards will be lower
classrooms like marilyn harvey at connaught are bearing much of the load
half of the  children in harvey class are withdrawn for english lessons for  minutes each day they range from a child who arrived from somalia a couple weeks ago to others who have had some esl training
""""i was born in ottawa but i learned english in kindergarten, explains trevor szutu, a chatty child whose parents immigrated from china """"i speak hong kong language, and english, and a little bit of french
""""my dad tells me to be good and work hard and learn english so i don't have to be like him and work in a restaurant
the children also pick up the language from each other
keith mccuaig, originally from renfrew, and zarko lakovic, from bosnia-hercegovina, are buddies
their assignment one recent morning was to measure body parts with string -- feet, fingers, hands -- and tape the string to a huge piece of yellow construction paper
""""my foot is bigger than yours, keith crowed as he wrestled zarko for control of the scissors and they chattered non-stop
zarko arrived two years ago without a word of english he has grasped the fundamentals of his new language, and no longer receives extra english lessons
exciting new world
harvey says the mix of languages and cultures opens an exciting new world for children
""""it just reinforces the fact that everyone in the world is different, but we're all people and can get along it teaches them that in a very subtle, non-imposing way
keith mother, barbara sibbald, agrees she was delighted when they moved to ottawa this fall from renfrew, where all the students in keith class were white and english-speaking
""""keith would come home from school and say `so-and-so is from ukraine, where that?' and i would show him on the map
""""i thought it was just a wonderful opportunity for keith to be exposed to all these different cultures and languages and children from different backgrounds
sibbald says harvey does a terrific job but she wonders whether the immigrant children are getting enough help and she wonders whether the schoolwork is challenging enough for her son
""""i don't see how one teacher can cater to all of those needs in a classroom of  kids there are only so many ways a teacher can divide herself if some kids are more demanding, other kids are getting less
but parents of non-immigrant children are often reluctant to speak out about the growing pressures on classroom teachers, and how that hurts their children, says heather-jane robertson, director of professional development for the canadian teachers' federation they're afraid of being branded as unwelcoming to immigrants or racist, says robertson
the esl students are also being short-changed, says hoan le, co-chair of the esl support coalition students who don't know english are being thrown into regular classrooms before they are ready, says le she worries that esl kids will fall behind, become frustrated and drop out of school
""""these children human rights are being violated that the way i see it
activists like le say the issue has not received much attention partly because immigrant parents are not likely to protest often they don't know english and are struggling to get settled, find a job and figure out the school system
""""they just squeeze these kids because their parents can't speak english, charges le """"the idea seems to be that these people are weak, they can't mount any resistance
crisis in funding
the canadian school boards association calls the situation a crisis, warning that funding and resources for children learning their new language are inadequate
""""the long-term implications for canada will be a generation of young people who lack the ability to integrate successfully into and contribute to their adopted country, the association warned in a  report the situation has worsened since then, says the association
immigration levels remain high, and for big city school boards looking for ways to reduce budgets, esl is a likely target
in september, the ottawa board of education cut about a third of its esl teachers to save money it had to hire some back during the year to cope with the average  new students who arrive each week needing english lessons but overall, students learning english get less instruction than last year
it a similar story in other municipalities facing tight budgets the peel board of education slashed its esl teaching staff by  per cent this year in halifax, the board is considering eliminating all esl teachers
the cuts at the obe inspired the creation of the esl support coalition, comprised of activists and community organizations that help immigrants
but the coalition has attracted little publicity and had no luck convincing the school board to restore esl funding in the budget the school board passed last month the coalition is also pressuring the province to force school boards to provide esl instruction
other local school boards have fewer immigrant students however, the carleton board of education, which covers the region suburban and rural schools, is also considering cuts to english-language training trustees, in budget discussions this month, will consider cutting  of the  esl teachers in high schools in a bid to keep the tax increase down
students concentrated
esl is an increasingly pointed issue, especially in urban areas where immigrant students are concentrated
consider connaught, an english-language school which is near the region emergency housing shelter and low-cost apartments attractive to newcomers principal carol kirby estimates that more than half the  students at the school have neither english nor french as a first language
at the obe, staff estimate that  to  per cent of the board , students have neither english nor french as a first language
not all of them receive special language training, however about , students in the board receive special english instruction
the amount of language training the board is able to give newcomers is decreasing, although each school handled the reduction in esl teachers differently
for example, at cambridge street public school, where  of the  students require english lessons, the number of esl teachers was reduced from  to three

1663486379,Human Rights Code prevents landlords from discriminating against student renters,"The Human Rights Code of Ontario (the """"Code"""") trumps almost all other legislation other than the Charter of Rights. (Since the Charter is mainly concerned with the actions of governments, it does not generally apply to the relationship between a landlord and a tenant.)","  q: i am a landlord in ottawa with a dozen or so rental apartments in the centretown area i have become increasingly uncertain about my rights as a landlord in ontario in vetting potential tenants i know i can ask a rental applicant to provide information such as current residence, employment history, personal references and income information if credit references and rental history information are also requested but what if the prospective tenant is a student who has only lived at home? they have no rental history and no credit references and a very light employment history i am not interested in having a parent act as a guarantor or co-signer can i refuse to rent to such an applicant without running afoul of the human rights code?
a: the human rights code of ontario (the """"code"""") trumps almost all other legislation other than the charter of rights (since the charter is mainly concerned with the actions of governments, it does not generally apply to the relationship between a landlord and a tenant)
the code prohibits discrimination based on age and numerous other characteristics the code also prohibits constructive discrimination, that is, discrimination on a characteristic of a person which is tied to a prohibited ground an example would be the status of being a student, since that is tied very closely with age consequently you cannot refuse to rent to someone solely because they have no rental or credit history
the law is that """"no record"""" does not equal """"a bad record"""" the human rights commission says, """"landlords should not treat the lack of a rental history as equivalent to a negative rental history where a prospective tenant lacks a rental history for reasons related to a code ground, landlords should look at other available information on the prospective tenant to make a bona fide assessment""""
the difference between a negative rental history and no rental history was underlined in court cases in this area, and clearly stated in the ahmed case decided in  that case was about a relatively new immigrant, but the logic applies to people who do not have records due to their age (such as students) as well as their recent arrival in canada
in the ahmed case, expert evidence was given and accepted that the lack of a credit history did not predict default, and that most tenants value their housing enough to rearrange their affairs or take on new debt to keep up their rental payments
with students, the stereotype is of irresponsible partying, noise and defaults however, the reality is that only a minority of students behave badly the thrust of the human rights code is to prevent landlords and others from acting on stereotypes each applicant must be assessed on their own merits you may want to ask the prospect for a letter of reference from a recent teacher or another community member
past bad behaviour by an individual applicant is a legitimate reason for refusing to grant a tenancy, but being a member of a group defined by age or race or place of origin is not

438779513,"MD used to action switches to talks; Ontario Medical Association president John Rapin has scaled back his emergency-room duties He brings a down-to-earth perspective to negotiations with health minister, Rob Ferguson reports:   [ONT Edition ]","When [John Rapin] took the helm of the OMA in May, and scaled back his busy emergency ward shifts to one a week and rented an apartment in Toronto, negotiators for doctors and the government were about half- way through nine months of difficult talks. Rapin's move came at a time when emergency medicine was being recognized as a specialty in its own right, says former student and long-time colleague Dr. Michael O'Connor, who now serves as head of emergency at Queen's and the two teaching hospitals. Until then, emergency shifts were often covered by doctors who had privileges at hospitals with help from interns and residents. Michael Stuparyk Toronto Star Dr. John Rapin, president of the Ontario Medical Association, is a veteran emergency room physician. Negotiations between the OMA and the province's health ministry on a new contract for doctors has given him an unexpectedly high profile.","  several years ago, when he wasn't treating emergency patients at kingston general hospital or teaching future physicians at queen's university, dr john rapin spent his spare time helping to find family doctors for local residents without one
now, he's playing a different and unexpectedly high-profile role in the province's health system as president of the ontario medical association, locking horns with health minister george smitherman
""""i didn't think this would become quite so public,"""" the down-to- earth -year-old says as the oma prepares a response to government plans to impose a controversial new contract on ontario's , practising doctors
when rapin took the helm of the oma in may, and scaled back his busy emergency ward shifts to one a week and rented an apartment in toronto, negotiators for doctors and the government were about half- way through nine months of difficult talks
a deal was quietly reached in mid-september as both sides tried to keep details under wraps
but as the details leaked out and the oma did not advise its members to vote in favour - instead leaving them to make up their own minds about sweeping reforms to the way health care is delivered - criticisms grew from some physician circles
fifty-nine per cent of doctors rejected the deal two weeks ago, prompting the government to revise its offer by bringing raises forward to the early years of the deal and addressing several other concerns, but offering no more money overall than the $ billion already on the table in the four-year pact
the deal breaks new ground with financial incentives of up to  per cent for doctors who will work in areas with doctor shortages, see patients outside traditional office hours, work in groups with other health professionals and provide better care for patients with chronic diseases like diabetes
rapin, a married father of four grown children, went from spending eight or nine nights a month at his downtown toronto apartment to  last month as the deal unravelled and tensions with the government increased
but he refuses to draw parallels between his -year specialty of emergency medicine and the growing crisis over the government's refusal to return to the bargaining table
""""when you do medicine and look after very ill people, bad things happen sometimes it puts the other things in perspective,"""" says rapin, who has experienced tragedy himself his first wife died when their daughter, now  and living in switzerland, was just  years old
""""i don't get terribly personally distressed by medical politics and so on i try to deal with the issues""""
the person who is top of mind these days is smitherman, who noted this week that rapin """"has my cellphone number""""
as a long-time follower of politics - """"i'm one of these people who's always voted"""" - rapin says he doesn't take the impasse with the health minister personally
""""he means well,"""" says rapin
""""he's trying to do the right thing, and more recently we seem to have some political difference  i don't think it's the minister's agenda being foisted on us now; it's clearly a government agenda""""
when smitherman broke the news to rapin eight days ago that talks would not resume and presented him with the revised offer, premier dalton mcguinty was in the room, a reminder of the government's election promise to improve health care
""""they're doing a job they were elected to do; it's a hard job,"""" acknowledges rapin, who maintains changes in the ways doctors work must be evolutionary, not revolutionary
asked how he gets along with the often combative smitherman, the down-to-earth rapin pauses and leans back in his chair at the oma office a -minute walk from queen's park
he suggests the tone is businesslike
""""we're on a first-name basis he's a personable guy he's got a lot of energy, he's bright but we haven't had anything to do with each other outside the professional relationship""""
rapin grew up in eastern ontario, coming to canada at age  with his farmer parents on the canadian pacific steamship empress of scotland as an """"economic immigrant"""" originally from switzerland
he landed in emergency medicine almost by accident after picking queen's university medical school at the encouragement of his family doctor in nearby gananoque
after queen's, rapin, who is also fluent in french, moved to hamilton to do his residency in family medicine but later found it wasn't his cup of tea
""""i wasn't prepared just for an office practice dealing with ongoing things it didn't suit my personality,"""" says rapin, who, ironically, finds it distressing that about  per cent of the patients he sees in emergency don't have family doctors he can send them to for follow-up care
so, he returned to kingston and made a career home in the emergency wards at kingston general, hotel dieu hospital and teaching in the medical school at his alma mater
""""i can do more things,"""" he says of emergency department work """"it's unpredictable i just enjoy that more excitement""""
rapin's move came at a time when emergency medicine was being recognized as a specialty in its own right, says former student and long-time colleague dr michael o'connor, who now serves as head of emergency at queen's and the two teaching hospitals until then, emergency shifts were often covered by doctors who had privileges at hospitals with help from interns and residents
but specializing in emergency comes at a personal cost, says rapin, who sympathizes with older doctors who find it difficult to take advantage of incentives in the new contract to provide medical care, when necessary, on -hour call
unlike many industries, where seniority brings guaranteed days shifts, emergency medicine in a teaching hospital offers no such luxury
""""the shift work becomes difficult after the age of  evenings, weekends, nights,"""" says rapin, who shares an east-end kingston bungalow with evelyn, his wife of  years three sons in their early s sometimes pop in with dirty laundry or to hit dad up for some cash
""""i don't think i can work overnights anymore, for example i'm finding that it's pretty hard for me to function well at  am at the end of a shift""""
accordingly, rapin expects to trim his emergency shift load in the next couple of years, once his life returns to normal after his oma stint winds down next may
""""i don't intend to practise until i'm , but i certainly do intend to stay active until at least ,"""" says the avid golfer, who also likes to relax by reading history and watching tv at the same time
he's considering whether to retrain in palliative care or nursing home medicine, considering he already sees many dying and elderly patients from nursing homes in the emergency ward
after his current one-year term as oma president and another year with less onerous duties as past-president, rapin says he has no plans for active involvement in medical or any other kind of politics
he first got involved in medical politics because he noticed a lot of concern from doctors but not much action
""""you listen to all the doctors sitting around complaining about things, but there aren't that many that are prepared to actually even go to the oma annual meeting  i felt the need to get involved to see if i could make a change""""'when you do medicine and look after very ill people, bad things happen sometimes'

The cancellation of Wind means that next year, for the first time in 13 seasons, there will not be an original Kevin Sullivan production anchoring CBC's Family Hour, the 7 p.m. Sunday slot created by former CBC programmer Ivan Fecan in 1989. Instead, the time period will be given over to reruns of Wind and Emily of New Moon. The latter has already aired on CH (ONtv) in Ontario.

just now, the web chat is a tad hysterical that's because the series, which has warmed the hearts of millions during the past five seasons, is about to breathe its last wind at my back, wamb to aficionados, ends for good sunday with a two-episode finale that begins at  pm
viewers have launched e-mail campaigns to save the show fan sites urge visitors to lobby the cbc to renew the series """"the show is not dead yet,"""" one web site assures fans
not true, actually the show died more than a year and a half ago the last episode was filmed in august of ; it's just taken this long for cbc to get it on air the carefully crafted town of new bedford, built on sullivan entertainment's backlot in suburban toronto, has long since been torn down nothing short of an entire recalibration of the canadian production industry could revive wind at my back
this doesn't make sense to internet fans, who are used to a us network model where shows are cancelled because they're losing audiences, because producers have grown tired of making them or because networks have grown tired of carrying them under such circumstances, a vigorous write-in campaign actually has a chance of being heard and acted upon in the case of wind at my back, however, none of these things is in play
this season, the series is getting some of it biggest audiences ever kevin sullivan thinks the show had another two years in it, and the cbc would have been happy to continue carrying it
so who killed wind at my back? nobody, really its federal subsidy ran out and a canadian series without a subsidy is a series in theory only the hard truth is that the canadian television market is no more capable of supporting an indigenous production community than it was almost two decades ago when the federal funding agency telefilm canada was created
telefilm and its publicly supported colleague, the canadian television fund, can jointly provide up to  per cent of the cost of a series, but they will support dramas for no more than  episodes, the equivalent of five -episode seasons the theory is that after five seasons, a production should be strong enough to exist on its own the theory has never proved sound even canada's most successful drama export, due south, needed subsidies to survive
in the us, the cost of producing shows is born almost entirely by the originating network canadian broadcasters, with a much smaller advertising market, say they can't afford to underwrite any more than about  per cent of production costs on an original canadian series foreign sales on a show like wind at my back, which is seen on several us specialty channels as well as overseas, account for only  per cent of production costs the subsidies make up the difference, and the bureaucracy follows strict guidelines about when to pull the plug
""""you'd think the funding agencies would reward success,"""" muses kevin sullivan, though he's not really complaining """"producing a show like wind is a dream, so you can't complain it's got its own magnificent little world and a wonderful ensemble cast""""
sullivan almost had the financing in place for a replacement series, a contemporary family drama with the same kind of heart, he says the deal was supported by a foreign broadcaster who would have given him as much creative leeway as the us disney channel did when it was a partner in his earlier series, road to avonlea but again the rules and regulations of the federal subsidy program got in the way
the foreign broadcaster wanted  episodes a year, and was willing to pay half the costs, which would have reduced the need for subsidies on each program but the canadian television fund won't fund more than  episodes a year, which was too few for the foreign broadcaster to consider
""""there's been a kind of a ghetto attached to canadian funding,"""" says sullivan """"it doesn't always really work with what you can fund in the marketplace outside canada""""
the cancellation of wind means that next year, for the first time in  seasons, there will not be an original kevin sullivan production anchoring cbc's family hour, the  pm sunday slot created by former cbc programmer ivan fecan in  instead, the time period will be given over to reruns of wind and emily of new moon the latter has already aired on ch (ontv) in ontario
but cbc has commissioned sullivan entertainment to provide another original series of period canadiana for the following season, though the producer says he has no idea what it might be """"you got any ideas?"""" sullivan asks
meanwhile, he'll go into production this summer on a wind at my back christmas movie for the fall the film will pick up some of the plot threads left dangling after this sunday's finale, sullivan promises

2701431352,Telling stories of Afghan women:   The Shoe Project paired Canadian mentors with women who escaped after the fall of Kabul,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the january snow-laden trees outside my toronto window were far away from the empty concrete walls of a room somewhere in pakistan i reached out with my voice to close the distance i had just begun working with a group of young afghan women who fled their country after the fall of kabul on aug , 
through the shoe project, which i founded, a group of writers and artists, including distinguished canadian novelist caroline adderson and brilliant banff soprano nan hughes, coaches women immigrants and refugees using a pair of shoes as a metaphor to express their journey
we've been making stories with newcomer women, refugees, for  years usually they were already in canada, their hoped-for destination this time, they hadn't yet arrived, and so this was new we would be beamed via zoom to their secret location near islamabad, where they are staying until they can, one day soon, make it here they were in the process of applying new, too, because they were a migrant group, representatives of a unique generation, born at the turn of the st century when the west was attempting reform in afghanistan; they were raised and educated and already changing their country until what happened that day
as mentors we first met a gaggle of shy """"girls"""" (as afghans call all unmarried females) their english was good shyness soon gave way to eloquence lashed by grief and fear, optimism and sheer grit in pakistan, they contended with insecure housing, several moves to what they hoped were safer locations, and lousy internet class might be at  am toronto time, or at  pm vancouver they had little freedom they were lonely and feared for families left behind when they didn't show up, we worried mostly we signed on, listened, and watched how quickly they became their own best editors
maliha kazimi had worked as a journalist the title of the book we've created from this project, """"waterlilies"""" is hers """"waterlilies grow in the mud, nevertheless they blossom beautifully although the terrorist and extremist groups, discrimination, corruption, violence and insecurity, the dreadful explosions all  joined hands to terrorize us, we grew we carried on (with) bloody books, broken pens, and pieces of fabric from the bloody bodies of our dear ones we were hopeful  we believed in better days""""
she talked about her kabul, the one she lived in before aug ,  i could picture it she spoke of her generation: """"democratic values were in their infancy in kabul province; however my democracy generation had battled for them for  years our struggle between tradition and modernity was ongoing
""""pole e sorkh, near my neighbourhood, was one of the gathering places for the democracy generation streets were crowded with girls and boys, men and women on their way home from jobs, groups of friends shopping you could see hope in the steps of all cafes, some owned by women, sprang up like mushrooms in these, mixed groups of women and men, colleagues and artists gathered girls wore colourful clothes, laughing loudly, dreaming about their bright futures""""
these particular members of the democracy generation that we are coming to know are hazara, a persecuted minority exceptionally well-educated about human rights, they worked and studied, were activists and supported their parents, who perhaps could not read and write they and their families are resilient
""""in afghanistan most people enjoyed such small happiness's (sic),"""" wrote maryam, thinking of her own happiness with the new shoes she bought with her first paycheck """"when it was eid they were happy, when it was snowing they were happy and giving thanks to god, when there was no bomb explosion for some days they were happy, when it was mother's day they were happy""""
setara was a banker, fahima a black belt in tae kwan do """"i saw lots of street harassment in kabul,"""" she wrote """"i faced very bad looks and heard very bad things from men one morning when i was walking to school a bicycle came and hit me on the buttocks after that, i did not dare go through empty alleys or to crowded places, in case i would be harassed"""" she spent five years training while in high school, then taught """"self-defence and kicks up to ninth grade, to both boys and girls""""
as our classes stretched from february through march and were extended to april, the writers relived what they had been doing, 'that night' - the night kabul fell
marwa was baking a fragrant spiced meat and vegetable dish, aykhanum, with her extended family of 
farzana, already a public speaker in second-year university, ran home when she heard: her father was out of country working and her mother was terrified """"that was not just a simple night like many others it was a nightmare a big reality nightmare with taliban people were running away women were shouting and crying in the streets on that night birds were not flying dogs were not barking as darkness fell, the silence of the devil took kabul""""
faradis was in her scrubs in a hospital operating theatre when the taliban burst in """"while leaving, i took one of my medical gowns and the stethoscope, which were awarded to me for earning the top score at the kabul university of medical science, also the red pen awarded for the completion of my research""""
as the months went on and the snow outside my toronto window reluctantly gave way to lime-green leaf buds, they began to swelter i learned about """"load shedding"""" - in pakistan, when the weather warms up, all electricity is shut off, for hours each day
i learned about their decisions to leave their homes in late august and through to october, they quietly disappeared shekiba celebrated her father's heroism in supporting her decision """"he said, 'i don't want you to have the same destiny that other girls have in afghanistan' (he) accepted that we should come on this journey to continue our way many afghans have had the experience of living as refugees in other countries and now we would join them""""
najia described her farewell drive through kabul, disguised in burqa and niqab """"observing my city through mesh fabric was not comfortable, however, no freedom of choice was left for me i wanted (to) shout loudly so that our male-dominant society and the taliban would know that i am against oppression let me breathe at least, for god's sake! i was overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, loneliness and helplessness i desperately wished i could do something for the people who would be left behind""""
travelling east and south from kabul and trying several land borders to pakistan, they met face-to-face with the frightening talib militants with counterfeit documents - and guts and guile - they found their way out of the country
sumi talked her way past armed guards, speaking to them in their own language, urdu, which she picked up by watching tv serials
fatima defiantly wore the forbidden white shoes: """"because the taliban's flag is white, they believe that wearing white shoes is disrespectful i wore them to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with their system  as an afghani girl, there were so many things that i wasn't allowed to say but my shoes could say them i grabbed my long skirt and, lifting it, walked through to brightness with those white sneakers protesting with every step""""
they taught us about their world, and how they built it, about how it ended overnight they wrote powerfully as we can't hold a reading or performance yet, for safety issues, we have collected their stories into a chapbook entitled """"waterlilies""""
on this one-year anniversary, i think of the beauty and purifying power of the waterlilies when our edits were done i did not say goodbye; we will meet again, irl in a canadian airport soon i know geti will become the politician she was born to be """"we will fight [the taliban] not by gun but by education,"""" she says """"i and my friends who are with me will be back - with unlimited power"""" their stories do not stop here because an educated young woman - they are not girls, have they not earned the word? - who knows her rights will not be stopped

Since his raisedfist entry into politics just over a year ago, the former Quebecor CEO has found the transition to a world where he does not call all the shots difficult.","  there is a consensus that the five-person race for the parti quebecois leadership is pierre karl peladeau's to lose and he is doing his damnedest
jacques parizeau's  bitter referendum night speech blaming his side's loss on """"money and ethnic votes"""" is seared into the memories of quebecers, a textbook example of how to torpedo your own cause even eight years later, parizeau's rehashing of his theory from the sidelines of the  election campaign was enough to seal the pq's fate
but this week, out of nowhere, peladeau declared that quebec's low birthrate and the hordes of immigrants who """"swear allegiance to the queen"""" mean it is now or never for reaching independence """"we won't have  years to achieve it  it's clear we're losing a riding every year,"""" he said
to a lot of ears, it echoed parizeau, and within  hours peladeau had apologized for his """"inappropriate"""" comments, insisting they did not reflect his thinking
while it was startling to hear a pq politician give voice to such taboo beliefs, if anyone in the pq contest can be trusted to put his foot in his mouth, it is peladeau since his raisedfist entry into politics just over a year ago, the former quebecor ceo has found the transition to a world where he does not call all the shots difficult
his political career was not a week old before his leader, pauline marois, was fielding questions addressed to him to ensure he did not cause the party further trouble (his arrival and his passionate cry for independence had shifted the  campaign's focus onto terrain the pq preferred not to visit, the possibility of another referendum)
peladeau's loose-cannon tendencies have proven impossible to control last fall he told supporters in his riding that the federal bloc quebecois was useless, serving only to """"justify federalism"""" after la presse reported the comments, he backtracked, calling the bloc """"absolutely pertinent"""" he also threw a fit on twitter, accusing the la presse reporter who called him for comment on his personal cellphone of harassment
his suspicion of journalists has continued during the leadership campaign, with an insistence at a recent news conference that reporters ask just one question when one reporter attempted a followup, peladeau just stared, tightlipped he accused la presse of harassment again this month when it used publicly available donor lists to contact prominent quebecers who have given to his campaign
despite his various troubles, the latest polls available indicate peladeau remains the overwhelming favourite among pq supporters to become the next leader when the vote is held may  (a second ballot, if necessary, will take place a week later) a leger marketing poll published feb  showed peladeau was the preference of  per cent of pq supporters, with none of the other contenders higher than  per cent a feb  crop poll in la presse found that if an election were held then, a pq led by peladeau
would beat the liberals
the sovereigntist faithful have decided peladeau is their t best hope to lead them to independence, and as long as he promises swift action toward a referendum, they appear prepared to overlook his slip-ups

Mike Blanchfield explains why security experts fear climate change will lead to war on a scale we have yet to see on this planet.,"Climate change has been linked to predictions of massive flooding, droughts, population explosions and massive migrations of uprooted and desperate people facing life-threatening food and water shortages. Back in 2006, British Defence Secretary John Reid sounded the alarm in a major speech that linked climate change and declining natural resources to an increase in violent conflict over land, water and energy.","oct ,

""""we counted on this not happening -- at least not yet most scientists assumed the worst effects of climate change would occur later in the century still, enough warned there was a chance of an extreme weather event coming sooner and, if it hit just right, one of our big urban centres could be knocked out"""" the president recalls his most recent briefing on climate change where advisers said chances of a weather-related catastrophe were slim yet it hard to ignore the turmoil unfolding around the world he wonders if the dam burst that killed , in china will break the communist party grip on power he thinks of the food shortages that have forced more people into the world urban centres, sparking tension and conflict
the president gets ready to board a helicopter for an aircraft carrier, where the un general assembly has relocated
he writes one final thought in his diary: """"the culmination of disasters, needed cleanups, permafrost melting, lower agricultural yields, growing health problems and the like are taking a much terrible toll, much greater than we anticipated  years ago""""
- - -
war in the forecast
this presidential diary is, of course, fiction but its inclusion in a november  report by the national intelligence council, a washington security think-tank, illustrates a grim and troubling concern shared by the pentagon, the british defence ministry, the un, major aid agencies and, of course, environmentalists
climate change has been linked to predictions of massive flooding, droughts, population explosions and massive migrations of uprooted and desperate people facing life-threatening food and water shortages
""""climate security"""" is a phrase that is now being heard well beyond the war rooms of the west
the trepidation is that these threats will fuel a drive for war on a scale we have yet to see on this planet, bringing tension to stable parts of the world, making the tense places worse
don't dismiss this as military-driven paranoia: the alarm is being sounded by non-military actors, from un agencies, leading philanthropists, the world bank, as well as major international aid agencies that have always strived to maintain a healthy distance from the world military establishment
here in canada, the connection between climate change and global instability is not discussed publicly no one seems to know why
""""i don't want to be a scaremonger, but i am concerned climate change does not seem to be a priority within canada security, intelligence, defence establishment i'm concerned that, as far as i know, canadian security players haven't analysed the existing scientific reports,"""" says margaret purdy, who spent  years as a leading federal public servant in canada security apparatus, including as associate deputy minister of defence """"this is a large, existential kind of threat; it is different i can't think of any precedent for this kind of phenomenon""""
but some of canada european allies -- purdy points to britain as the leader -- have embraced climate change as a security issue """"they have ministers who have certainly stepped up and talked about it in very direct language""""
anthony cary, the british high commissioner to canada, says despite government cuts, london has supplied extra funding to spread concern about climate security the british have a senior canadian climate security officer, whose job it is to liaise with government departments, academics and other key players he stresses this is """"not a nefarious attempt to attack canada, or point out the inadequacies of canadian policy,"""" but rather an effort to """"encourage canadians to see it as a cross-cutting issue that should involve the whole of government, that needs to be led from the centre""""
back in , british defence secretary john reid sounded the alarm in a major speech that linked climate change and declining natural resources to an increase in violent conflict over land, water and energy he said climate change """"will make scarce resources, clean water, viable agricultural land even scarcer"""" and will """"make the emergence of violent conflict more rather than less likely""""
across the atlantic ocean, us secretary of state hillary clinton told her senate confirmation hearing that climate change is an unambiguous security threat """"at the extreme, it threatens our very existence,"""" she said """"but well before that point, it could well incite new wars of an old kind over basic resources like food, water and arable land""""
the pentagon most recent national defense strategy, unveiled last summer, lists climate change alongside terrorism and rogue states going nuclear """"over the next  years, physical pressures -- population, resource, energy, climatic and environmental -- could combine with rapid social, cultural, technological and geopolitical change to create greater uncertainty,"""" says the pentagon paper """"collectively, these developments pose a new range of challenges for states and societies""""
this month, a diverse group that included the us army, the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco), the world bank, and the philanthropic giant rockefeller foundation warned in a ,-page tome that the """"future effects"""" of climate change have """"unprecedented implications for political and social stability,"""" according to britain independent newspaper
yet, we hear little in canada, even though the implications are serious, if not dire -- particularly in the arctic where polar ice caps are melting faster than anyone predicted the national intelligence council report classifies canada as a """"winner"""" because a hotter planet would open northern lands to farming and habitable settlement """"i wouldn't go that far,"""" says purdy, now a senior research fellow at the center of international relations at the university of british columbia """"i think that a fairly narrow view of what could be in store""""
as she looks to the future, purdy sees the following threats:
- in atlantic canada, storm surges and rising sea levels could cause widespread flooding and economic hardship;
- in ontario, a loss of critical infrastructure, including power generation and water treatment;
- droughts, floods and wildfires in the prairies;
- in bc, forest fires, water shortages and new infestations of bugs;
- across canada, extreme weather that will increase the risk of infectious diseases
problem is, purdy says, that with the exception of some notable work in the departments of health and natural resources, no one has tried to quantify the long-term security effects of climate change in canada
the harper government ambitious arctic strategy, which calls for economic and social development, plus a greater military presence, is the best example of a policy that could address future threats, says purdy """"there is no doubt we will see the first implications in the arctic while that very serious and needs sustained attention, that not the whole picture,"""" she says """"we have seven climate zones and this huge footprint we're going to feel a wider variety of impacts than most european countries""""
purdy says the government must answer three questions, and urges the secretive security apparatus to bring in scientists and experts to help respond to the following:
 are the current government contingency plans adequate to deal with droughts and other disasters?
 how vulnerable is the critical infrastructure of nuclear plants, military installations, dams and transport networks?
 how ready is the public health system to deal with new pests and diseases that are considered rare, but could appear later when the country heats up?
""""over the last two years, i'm increasingly concerned that canada does not seem to be giving the same serious and sustained attention to the physical impacts that are laid out pretty clearly in the science and how they could translate into stresses and challenges for canadian security organizations,"""" says purdy
canada will also face pressure at home that will include demands to accept big numbers of settlers from other parts of the world
by , when the earth population has swelled to nine billion, the majority of the planet inhabitants will live in cities, where they will have """"crushing environmental footprints"""" but they will be just as vulnerable to floods, droughts, storms or other intense climate shifts, concludes a new study on future migration patterns, released this spring and sponsored by care international, the un institute for environment and human security and the earth institute of columbia university
""""climate change will motivate or force millions to leave their homes in search of viable livelihoods and safety,"""" said the study, which predicted """"the mass of people on the move will likely be staggering and surpass any historical antecedent""""
estimates vary from  million to  million """"environmental migrants"""" by , a moniker that will come to replace """"refugee""""
""""hundreds of millions, according to the world bank, will be on the move just because of sea level rise,"""" says purdy
""""what will happen in latin america? what will happen in the caribbean? what will happen in vulnerable countries, including asian countries that are countries of origin for our refugee movements in canada?""""
cary, the british envoy, says the wave of migration will become a great source of international tension """"it would lead to huge pressures on countries like canada to accept very large numbers of people""""
meanwhile, as security breaks down across the globe, canadian forces troops will be in even higher demand
earlier this year, the british ministry of defence predicted that repeated flooding will threaten major coastal cities and their critical infrastructure
the melting of the polar ice caps will create """"territorial tensions,"""" with arctic rim states competing for vast, untapped natural resources (this would, of course, apply to canada and russia, not to mention the us and several european countries)
the british military also predicted that weather will make life even more miserable in already tense parts of the world:
n in the middle east, rainfall shortages will reduce access to drinking water;
n india, china and pakistan will face a reduced water supply from melting himalayas glaciers, """"which will have a major impact on regional security the same is true for middle east countries such as turkey, syria, iraq, jordan, lebanon and israel""""
purdy says it not farfetched to conclude that climate change will fuel a rise in international terrorism
""""muslim countries will be among the hardest hit,"""" she says """"bin laden has spoken more than once on the inequities of climate change""""
already, some see harbingers in this summer drought on the prairies and in such high-profile disasters as hurricane katrina on the us gulf coast, the cyclone that ravaged myanmar and the steady melt of canada arctic
""""we don't know if hurricane katrina was caused by climate change, but we do know to a certainty that we're rapidly heading for a world where climate change causes more katrinas,"""" us democratic senator and former presidential hopeful john kerry told a june symposium at the council on foreign relations in new york """"more than one-third of americans live within coastal counties""""
this past week, kerry and retired military experts warned the senate foreign relations committee that rising sea levels could flood us naval bases not only in the indian ocean but on the docks of the atlantic fleet and nato north american headquarters in norfolk, virginia
in the fictional manhattan flood scenario, the us president of  confides in his diary:
""""i guess we had it coming, but it was a rude shock some of the scenes were like the stuff from world war ii newsreels, only this time it was not europe but manhattan""""
purdy says us president barack obama has shown a clear understanding of the security risks
""""this issue was certainly paid attention to by think-tanks and scholars, but it really took the arrival of barack obama with an aggressive approach to climate change""""
she is hopeful us influence combined with the growing pressure out of this december world climate change conference in denmark will prod canada and others to action
cary says britain diplomatic outreach is yielding positive signs at the highest levels
""""i've spoken to jim prentice, and i think he gets it,"""" cary says of canada environment minister """"i think canada will want to be a positive contributor""""
purdy says years of inaction by canada and other governments cannot be mitigated even if ambitious greenhouse gas reduction schemes or other dramatic interventions were on the horizon, they'd have little effect
""""what is really distressing is it just been in the last few months i've started to notice this flurry of very reputable scientific reports coming out that show that a lot of worst-case scenario projections the consensus is they are underestimated in terms of temperatures, sea level, etc, there a now a growing consensus the impacts will be faster and more several overall  that a concern,"""" she says
""""the causes can't be traced to the usual suspects -- spies, criminals, terrorists the cause comes back to all of us""""

in holland, the assassination of a popular filmmaker by a muslim extremist has provoked an intense public debate about the country's embrace of almost unlimited liberalism
in france, the rising political star nicolas sarkozy, former finance minister and now presidential candidate, describes the traditional, statist france as obsolete sarkozy wants france """"open, supple"""" - to be more like the us and britain that would be like calling for a new french revolution
in canada, our prevailing political culture is exceedingly nervous of any public discussion of values, which is seen as potentially divisive it's pretty skittish about any real debate about anything
there are some signs, albeit very small, that that might be changing a column of mine last week calling for a referendum on same-sex marriages inspired far more reader comment than any in a long time
the e-mails were divided almost evenly, pro and con those for same-sex marriages, and so against a referendum, were a lot angrier, declaring that equality rights should no more be put to a national vote than the abolition of slavery
those in favour were often more tentative, yet consistently expressed a strong desire for the issue to actually be debated rather than be left to judges and to politicians hiding behind judges' robes
a referendum is, of course, a most clumsy instrument but because of political cowardice, it's hard to see how else to have the kind of genuine debate so many want
it is understandable that those who favour same-sex marriages fear that latent homophobia will rear its ugly head but it's misplaced, i believe
the reason canada is now one of the most liberal societies in world - the most tolerant and accepting of differences, in other words - is because this is what canadians want, and not because a few judges so interpret the constitution the charter of rights and freedoms has become the definition of canadian identity
overwhelmingly, canadians want, i'm pretty sure, gays and lesbians to have the same rights as everyone else
but either a majority or a great many also want the institution of marriage to retain its special character as the expression of a commitment between two adults - and among them and the children they have come together to create
there is a widespread worry that this institution, unchanged in its essentials throughout human history, is at risk of being devalued as an example, the case for legalizing polygamy will soon be unarguable
""""civil unions"""" (as in france) are a way of squaring these two opposed circles gays and lesbians would have full legal and financial equality they would miss out only on the symbolic word, marriage
the counter-argument is that this would discriminate against gays and lesbians the supreme court itself, though, discriminated against them by the court's ruling, gays and lesbians who belong to faiths that oppose same-sex marriages, as most do, will not be able to get married in a church
here, the court was acting politically as much as legally
it does this quite often women are fully equal in law but women have long been """"discriminated"""" against entirely legally by being denied front-line positions in the armed services
my own guess is that canadians would welcome this kind of compromise at the very least, it's worth discussing
the national debate itself would be highly educational gays and lesbians would discover that canadians overwhelmingly want them to have full equality no less likely, the """"antis"""" may come to recognize that same-sex marriages, in fact, pose no threat to the institution itself
all of us would discover that we actually can discuss values we'd reach this level of political maturity at the very moment when, because of cloning and genetic engineering and the rest, our politics now cannot help but be about values as well as about the conventional stuff, such as what to do about health care or about missile defence
and, by the way, slavery ended, not because of any high-minded judges but because public opinion, mobilized by many religious leaders, wanted it scrapped

436140949,Italian play in mainstream spotlight:   [FIN Edition ],"When A Modo Suo, a play by Toronto Italian actor, writer and director Tony Nardi, opens at the Canadian Stage company Upstairs Stage on Berkeley St. downtown next month it becomes the first play written and performed in Italian to be staged in a mainstream Canadian theatre. Normally, because of a lack of funding, such plays are performed in ethnic community halls, church basements and such places frequented by immigrants. Nardi Mimesis Theatre group however, has successfully harnessed the backing of various mainstream arts- funding institutions, including grants from the Canada Council explorations program, the Ontario Arts Council and the ministry of culture and communications. The Rome-based Italian Cultural Institute in Toronto and Columbus Centre are also supporting the production. """"Just because it in Italian, a play shouldn't be ghettoized . . . presented only in a church basement on St. Clair. We want to remove the ethnic tag just because a play is about people who speak a language other than English or French. This isn't ethnic theatre. It a Canadian play in Italian. Our emphasis is theatre, not folklore. And theatre goes beyond the barriers of language.""""","when a modo suo, a play by toronto italian actor, writer and director tony nardi, opens at the canadian stage company upstairs stage on berkeley st downtown next month it becomes the first play written and performed in italian to be staged in a mainstream canadian theatre
a modo suo (each in his/her own way) is based on the experiences of an italian immigrant family from calabria in southern italy, living in st leonard, a suburb of montreal, as they struggle to cope in a strange, permissive canadian society
the three-act play in the calabrese dialect, produced by mimesis theatre, a recently formed group of thespians dedicated to the production of original canadians works exploring the italian- canadian culture, delves into tragic but often comic extreme situations that often lead to clashes in immigrant families it opens april  and continues to may

the play is being presented as a fable, designed to give a """"voice"""" to italian canadians with roots in calabria there are about , canadians of italian descent in metro about  per cent have origins in calabria
a modo suo is the story of raffaele, a single-minded husband and father determined to shape his family destiny in canada he demands that his children speak only italian in the home and expects them to cling to moral codes he knew in his homeland
lavish feast
indeed, raffaele wants to arrange a marriage for his daughter and throw a lavish wedding feast that will be the envy of his neighbors but daughter linda, raised in canada, won't hear of it raffaele begins to believe his wife carmela is being badly influenced by a """"liberated"""" sister-in law he also angry with his son salvatore who has moved out of the house and since has abandoned both his italian ways and the promise of a lucrative law practice
to make matters worse, his daughter starts smoking marijuana gradually raffaele becomes totally disenchanted with his lot in life he sees himself as a captain of a ship deserted by his crew
while the play is produced in a manner that non-italian audiences will generally understand with the help of a synopsis in english, most in the audience will be italian-speaking probably calabrese families
for many older italians going to a play downtown will be a new experience, says nardi after all, in their younger years most men were too busy earning a living in construction their wives rarely left the home other than to shop, go to church or attend an occasional wedding feast
the cast consists of nardi, frank crudele, lucy filippone, dom fiore, mary long and anna migliarisi alberto fortuzzi is co- director the play is produced under the auspices of columbus centre operated by the italian canadian benevolent corp
serves as 'mirror'
pal di iulio, the corporation executive director, says columbus centre is sponsoring the play because it serves as a """"mirror"""" for the post-war generation of italian canadians who, although they understand that culture, somehow are not totally part of it
""""it helps us find ourselves some will surely say 'this is not a play i lived it' it starts with reality and becomes art,"""" he says """"it helps us look at ourselves""""
says nardi: """"this story had to come out if you have something to write, something to explore theatrically, you do it when the time is right and the time is right""""
that because nowadays the regular theatre funding institutions are becoming aware that in a multicultural canadian society a play in any language can be equally a """"canadian"""" work or art, he says
""""just because it in italian, a play shouldn't be ghettoized    presented only in a church basement on st clair we want to remove the ethnic tag just because a play is about people who speak a language other than english or french this isn't ethnic theatre it a canadian play in italian our emphasis is theatre, not folklore and theatre goes beyond the barriers of language""""

Though we are in the middle of spring migration, there are a number of species in the process of nest building and egg laying.","  an amazing and surprising discovery this week by local birder jake walker caused a lot of excitement in the ottawa and ontario birding community
while birding in the early morning hours of april , at the britannia filtration plant near mud lake/britannia conservation area, walker discovered a violet-green swallow feeding in a flock of mainly tree swallows with cooler early morning temperatures, the flock of swallows flew low to feed on insects and presented excellent conditions for viewing important field marks of this swallow as the morning warmed up and insects dispersed, the swallows began to feed higher and over a larger area, which made it difficult to find the violet-green swallow by mid-morning, a small number of local birders had arrived by chance, the violet-green perched briefly in a nearby deciduous tree; no time was wasted and a number of good photos were taken
as the morning temperatures continued to rise, all of the swallows left the filtration plant area the violet-green swallow was again located feeding off britannia point over deschenes rapids at :  am among a mixed group of -plus swallows it was last reported around  pm at this location the following day it was observed feeding over mud lake this represents the first record for the ottawa-gatineau district and only the second documented record for ontario
the first was found on oct  and , , at thunder cape, thunder bay district the normal range for the violet-green swallow is western north america in canada it reaches to eastern saskatchewan and is a vagrant in manitoba and east to the atlantic coast there are only a handful of records in the northeast united states our """"ottawa"""" bird was likely blown off course by strong west winds experienced in our area that week high winds always bring in a small number of vagrants be on the watch and keep your camera ready!
with temperatures continuing to increase and spring in the air, now is the time to put up your hummingbird and/or oriole feeder both species enjoy feeding on a diluted sugar-water concentration, which can be bought locally, or you can google online for easy-to-make recipes ruby-throated hummingbirds and baltimore orioles have already been sighted in southern ontario and hopefully a few will be reported making their way to our area this weekend also, remember to keep your birdfeeders full! purple finches are migrating and more white-crowned spar-rows are being reported rose-breasted grosbeaks should be in our region shortly and enjoy visiting feeders i received more reports of brown thrashers and eastern towhees this past week from feeder watchers most birds were feeding on the ground below the feeders, eating the spelt seeds the eastern towhee, formerly called rufous-sided towhee, is a scarce breeder in the ottawa-gatineau district
there are still some late lingering common redpolls and american tree sparrows in the area during the next week most should be gone, travelling north for the summer both species breed in the hudson bay region and further north
though we are in the middle of spring migration, there are a number of species in the process of nest building and egg laying these species include the eastern phoebe, american crow, black-capped chickadee, white-breasted nuthatch, american robin, european starling and the northern cardinal i was pleasantly surprised on april  to find three robin nests on our property two pairs renovated old nests from last year and one nest was under construction there will likely be some territorial disputes!
the britannia conservation area is a great location for nesting pine warblers and to hear the song of singing males with warbler migration just starting, i was surprised to see a female pine warbler carrying nesting material to a tall white pine on april  on april , there was a noticeable increase in warbler activity with more yellow-rumped """"myrtle"""" warblers singing, along with a few palm, yellow and nashville warblers during the month of may, as many as  species of warblers pass through the ottawa-gatineau district and another  species are possible in eastern ontario if you can't make it to point pelee for spring warbler migration, there are more local areas including presqu'ile provincial park and prince edward point worth the visit new arrivals in the ottawa area this past week included virginia rail, common gallinule, broad-winged hawk, wilson's phalarope, house wren, cliff swallow, northern rough-winged swallow and field sparrow a flock of -plus sandhill cranes were observed flying west over east ottawa on april  these are likely late migrants
after commenting last week about window strikes, i received a picture of a dead common gallinule that had struck a window near mooney's bay it just shows you any species of bird can be a victim
the trumpeter swan continues to expand in eastern ontario one showed up on a small lake near barry's bay in the madawaska highlands and caused lots of excitement last weekend this individual was wing-tagged j the information was sent into the banding office, http: //wwwpwrcusgsgov/ bbl/bblretrv/
this month over  species will pass through eastern ontario this is one of the most exciting times of the year for birders now is the time to study your field guide, stock your feeders and review your bird songs! good luck and keep me posted!

the fight that canada is being drawn into is not about religion or ethnicity but about intolerance the terrorists made no faith- based distinction when they destroyed the world trade center the explosion killed muslims, christians and jews with equal force as we take action against the enemies of democracy abroad, we must be equally vigilant in isolating and restraining the voice of bigotry at home

fertility rates among immigrant women begin to decline shortly after they arrive in this country, according to new figures released yesterday by statistics canada
the study suggests immigrant women are quickly influenced by the same factors that tend to determine how many children canadian-born women have -- such as the need to pursue an education and work outside of the home

using recent census data, the study shows canada has come to depend on new immigrants to increase the country population

declining fertility rates of immigrant women are most evident among those from southern europe and least evident among those from south asia, central west asia, the middle east and africa
women who arrive in canada before they turn  are among those who demonstrate the declining fertility rates the most, because they are quickest to subscribe to canadian cultural values, the study said

""""Marks stepped into a mess,"""" Barbetta adds. Marks saw it all close-up: like Ackroyd, his route to the top included stints in planning and research. As Adamson executive assistant, Marks was the first senior officer to sit on the bargaining committee, where he was noted to have a short fuse and a hot temper.","note
in any event, five years down the road, marks has lasted longer than his predecessor, jack ackroyd, in the command post of the largest municipal police force in canada - a coveted position which pays its incumbent more than the premier of ontario
and every three months for the past few years, speculation has mounted that marks will soon retire, allowing one of the patiently waiting triumverate to step into the spotlight the new chief will have his hands full
glossy image
behind its glossy image, enhanced by a recent move into palatial new headquarters, the metro toronto police force is, like the community around it, grappling with conflict and change the force is a huge, labor-intensive organization, with a $-million annual budget for  it has , employees, including , sworn police officers; the majority are constables earning $, a year after four years the chief earns $, annually (the premier earns $,)
charges of racism have plagued police in recent months, in the wake of a metro cop killing lester donaldson, and peel cops killing wade lawson; both victims were black in the aftermath, officers closed ranks to protect their own; they say morale is bad, marks hasn't provided strong leadership, and management isn't sticking up for the men, who feel they're losing control of their work
since the beginning of the year,  experienced officers have quit; metro police feel the public is demanding impossible levels of service without appreciating what it like to face danger in the line of duty, making split-second decisions, forced into judgment calls that shouldn't be second-guessed by civilians who don't know what it means to walk a dark alley at  am
the force says that in the last three years it has targeted minorities for hiring; it has  visible minority officers - not enough for a multicultural area like toronto, according to the clare lewis task force on race relations and policing, though better than any other police force and many corporations in canada still, some segments of the public are uneasy
""""here we are again in an atmosphere of mutual distrust and pessimism,"""" said lawyer susan eng, speaking to the lewis task force in february a former board member of the urban alliance on race relations, she described a decade of activism, responding to crisis situations involving the police
""""once the crisis is over    the institutions that were cooperative during the emergency lose interest"""" she listed """"countless government-funded conferences, workshops and task forces"""" that, in her experience, produced little change
""""the question then becomes: whether as an institution the police force is simply not open to suggestions for change and refuses to be accountable for its actions""""
the inertia she sees as characteristic of chief marks' tenure has been felt internally, according to some officers, as an attempt to maintain the status quo, not rock the boat the way jack ackroyd did
criminal lawyer clayton ruby says marks has done nothing for a force that is, in ruby words, """"out of control if the police don't want to integrate (with women and minorities), they ain't gonna do it; they don't care how many studies tell them to integrate this is crazy they stopped working because one of them was charged with manslaughter for killing a black this is frightening the force is out of control at the top""""
conflicting visions
not everyone agrees
""""jack marks is a good chief of police,"""" says the legendary frank barbetta, the high-profile supercop once touted as the man most likely to become chief when jack ackroyd stepped down but barbetta didn't get the job, marks did, and therein hangs a tale of conflicting visions that still haunts the force
barbetta represents a breed of officer that still powerful and not too pleased about the way things are going for metro finest he can be found, these days, ensconced in the spiffy north york headquarters of carling o'keefe brewery, where he is chief of security
barbetta is a man man, a tall ex-detective with a sweet smile and a very tough reputation at , he says he enjoying civilian life, although one of his former colleagues says he was """"very bitter"""" when he wasn't made chief
the son of an immigrant from pisticci (in southern italy), barbetta grew up in scarborough and joined the force in  for  years he honed his policing skills, spending a decade in the hold- up and homicide squads, becoming chief of detectives and, ultimately, staff superintendent, only two ranks from the summit of his profession
along the way, he developed strong opinions: barbetta does not like politicians (and police commissioners) interfering with professional police work, doesn't appreciate politicians caving in to """"small pressure groups"""" that portray """"the police automatically as the bad guys""""
the clare lewis task force report """"has got police officers and former police officers angry    what makes clare lewis and his committee experts on policing i don't know""""
as for more women on the force, """"jane (pepino) wants to see more women    qualified women, fine but you hire women officers, they get married, have babies    can you imagine if you had a diverse police force made up of  per cent women and  per cent men?""""
he laughs at the ridiculousness of the idea
then there his reputation as a rough, tough enforcer with whom it would be inadvisable to stroll along cherry beach on a dark night
""""we dealt with hardened criminals,"""" he says, making no apologies """"there were dangerous people that ran around with guns they weren't boy scouts they were tough people and we were tough to respond to them""""
not a hypocrite
""""barbetta problem,"""" says a police insider, """"is that he not a hypocrite frank tells it like it is - and liberal audiences don't like what they hear""""
others say: """"thank god barbetta didn't become chief of police""""
in early , chief ackroyd stepped down shortly afterwards, jack marks was appointed why didn't barbetta get the job? one answer, suggested to him from another source, was that sidney linden, the first head of the public complaints commission, """"ran to (metro chairman paul) godfrey office and said if barbetta was appointed chief it would be like sending a message to the police that they could do what they wanted""""
on august , , barbetta retired to take his current job at carling o'keefe
""""people say, 'oh you must hate the force'    i love the force it was good to me"""" jack marks """"has had to operate under extremely difficult circumstances that weren't of his making he had a lot dumped on his shoulders""""
the saga of what jack marks inherited reaches beyond ackroyd to his predecessor, chief harold adamson worshipped by his men, chief adamson presided over the toronto force during the turbulent s he was a tough cop of the old school, charismatic and authoritarian
in , he was confronted with the -page morand report, prepared by the royal commission into metropolitan police practices, headed by the mr justice donald morand the report immortalized, among other instances of police brutality, the case of thomas henderson, an -year-old postal worker whose torture at the hands of the police included having vise grips and a claw applied to his genitals
from the morand report: """"officer jilek punched henderson on the left side of the head officer rusk then put the claw in (henderson) left nostril, locking it closed    they again took down henderson pants and handcuffed his right hand to the chair rusk indicated henderson penis and said, 'hold it out for us, so that i can put it on' henderson stated that jilek then put the claw on his penis and pulled it off, after approximately five to ten seconds, causing a tear in the skin henderson was very frightened and was crying""""
violence and threats
morand concluded: """"although it is difficult to believe that conduct such as that alleged by henderson could occur in this city, i have come to the conclusion that henderson allegations concerning the violence and threats made upon him at the police station did, in fact, occur""""
in , lawyer arthur maloney had recommended a system for public complaints involving a civilian commissioner but the police opposed any form of civilian review and nothing happened a year after the morand report, walter pitman examined race relations and recommended that morand recommendations be implemented still, nothing happened
it took roy mcmurtry, as attorney general and solicitor general, to break through police resistance in , he appointed sidney linden to re-do maloney study of public complaints procedures two years later, linden became the first public complaints commissioner almost from the beginning, he was a pariah in police circles, though critics would charge that the complaints commission was a toothless tiger
still, the winds of change were beginning to blow progressive citizens were delighted by the appointment of toronto-born jack ackroyd as chief in  kojak, as he was affectionately nicknamed - a tribute to his gleaming bald dome - was something of a gay blade, a connoisseur of fine wines and attractive women, a habituee of the royal york imperial room, a community activist who, as he rose through the ranks, made an effort to make friends outside the force he raised money for hospitals, cystic fibrosis, the new ymca
it was an era in which sexist and racist attitudes were deeply entrenched one minor """"joke"""" from a variety club-police roast in  gives the tenor of the times: jake dunlap, ex-footballer, friend to cops and man about town, pointed to adamson and ackroyd and said, """"one day they read in the paper that a man was wanted for rape they both applied for the job"""" everybody laughed
ackroyd was one of the guys, but, in other significant ways, he wasn't he embraced new ideas about the role of police to a degree that would alienate his cohorts
""""my greatest thrust over the next five years,"""" he told the star in , """"is to get civilians into jobs that are being done by police officers - that could adequately be done by civilians - so that we can free up police officers for foot patrol""""
but two years later he was gone, driven out by the resistance of the force
yet ackroyd legacy is alive and kicking at police headquarters - in fact, he initiated the airy pleasure dome that now straddles the corner of college and bay sts, on the site of the old ymca, his other main love and the goals of his administration are still relevant, contained in the  hickling-johnston report
known as the hj report, it was a massive study that """"touched every facet of the police force,"""" says deputy chief peter scott, then a superintendent chosen by ackroyd to implement hj recommendations
""""with some exceptions, like traffic, the report is a good basic blueprint for the force,"""" scott says but it was a radical document: """"it attempted to change the philosophy of policing""""
essentially, ackroyd tried to move the force toward community- based policing, carried out by a constable generalist, emphasizing prevention, sensitivity to community needs, foot patrols, public accountability - a shift characterized by opponents as an effort to turn police into social workers
social agency
""""police hate to admit it,"""" says ackroyd today, """"but we are a social agency -  per cent of calls are not about criminal occurrences or traffic accidents"""" the major mistake he made, he says, was not immediately changing the report name to something like the metro police plan for strategic change as it was, the force never owned the hj report
those who appreciate ackroyd efforts describe him as a brilliant, progressive, forward-thinking cop who hauled the toronto force into the modern age """"i felt those things about ackroyd at first,"""" says clay ruby, """"but i lost respect for him with the bathhouse raids""""
the april,  raids by metro police on bathhouses frequented by homosexual males and subsequent criminal charges sparked a wave of protest by the city gay community and from civil rights activists, who accused the force of homophobia
""""then you have to ask: what did he accomplish?"""" continues ruby """"apart from modernizing the technology of the force, which he did very well, nothing happened""""
those who didn't like ackroyd drift or suspected his motives refer to him as """"a con artist, a bullshitter, a hypocrite,"""" in the words of one former officer """"ackroyd knew how to tell liberal audiences what they wanted to hear he spoke out of both sides of his mouth""""
don fowke, then chairman of hj, remains convinced of ackroyd sincerity fowke got to know ackroyd through their mutual involvement at the ymca """"ackroyd looked like a cop cop,"""" says fowke, """"but he was an unusual man"""" big, muscular, barrel-chested, bullet-headed, he """"was a tough guy but he had an intellectual side you didn't expect he had an ability to connect with the community in a way a lot of policemen can't""""
ackroyd was especially concerned about street kids; he felt that a lot of preventive work needed to be done, that the police couldn't continue to maintain order through crisis enforcement - an outlook which seems highly prescient, given current problems with teenage gangs
in the end, it was the fortress mentality of the police, the """"us against them"""" defensiveness that shut out civilians with good ideas, that prevailed the opposition got so bad, says deputy chief scott, that when he was trying to implement the hj recommendations, there were some groups that would barely let him in the door; everywhere he went among the rank and file, he encountered resistance, which he considered a normal response """"when all the values you've developed over a lifetime in a job are being changed""""
""""ackroyd did not resist change, he assisted change,"""" says deputy chief bill mccormack, """"but sometimes he was a bit too quick with it"""" just months before his departure, an ackroyd-initiated shake- up of some  senior officers resulted in a dozen of them resigning or retiring
rapid promotions
the old guard resented the rapid promotions accorded """"ackroyd golden boys"""" at one point, a group of senior officers met the board of commissioners privately, to warn that the hj-ackroyd thrust had to be stopped
it was after  years with the force, on feb , , ackroyd resigned - not to suffer: he became chairman of the liquor control board of ontario at $,, in addition to his police pension of $, annually officially, his resignation was treated as a surprise, but inside the force everybody knew what it was about
""""if ackroyd had the vision, he should have stayed to see it through,"""" says barbetta, who felt ackroyd made a better deputy (under adamson) than he did a chief """"marks stepped into a mess,"""" barbetta adds
marks downplays his dilemma """"i wouldn't say it was a mess most of the hj recommendations were excellent; they just didn't work out the way we thought they would""""
marks' job, it seemed, was to calm the storms ackroyd had raised; he had the unenviable task of managing the fallout from ackroyd troubled regime
like adamson and barbetta, marks was a scarborough resident, though he was born at st michael hospital in toronto he grew up in the east end, in the jones ave and queen st e area, and attended danforth tech his father was a jewelry salesmen
after a stint in the army and five years in the trades (as an electrician), he joined the force in  his hero was harold adamson, whom he refers to as """"a true leader but he had his problems too - he had the morand report"""" chiefs, in other words, never have it easy
marks saw it all close-up: like ackroyd, his route to the top included stints in planning and research as adamson executive assistant, marks was the first senior officer to sit on the bargaining committee, where he was noted to have a short fuse and a hot temper
""""he would get mad and stomp out of the room,"""" says a former police negotiator unlike ackroyd, he was not noted for exotic tastes an elder at his local presbyterian church, he had three children and few interests outside the force his hobby was woodworking
promoted by ackroyd in  to a """"super deputy"""" post in charge of the day-to-day operations of the force, marks was ideally positioned to run the shop while a new chief was being groomed but he resented the persistent notion of the alleged temporary nature of his promotion and seemed unable to win the rank and file to his side
time of healing
while his supporters characterize his tenure as """"a time of healing,"""" disgruntled officers say he has pleased nobody """"ackroyd was either hated or loved,"""" says one, """"but marks has been too wrapped up in his own problems to do anything
""""the working atmosphere isn't good, hasn't been good for years we've lost our regular partners, the workload is crazy, and management attitude is, hut up and do the job""""
at , marks remains a fast-talking booster of the metro force the major cause of poor morale, he says, is the citizens' complaints procedure metro cops """"don't like it because it unfairly singles them out we're not saying it should be done away with, we think it should be province-wide and apply to all police across the province that all i ask""""
his greatest personal satisfaction has come, he says, from developing area foot patrols and pursuing employment equity """"we haven't reached utopia yet but we've done more than anyone else""""
he also proud of a mobile mini-van police station which can be parked in trouble spots such as shopping plazas and moved as the force sees fit eventually there will be five such units
""""i've tried to build up relations with the community,"""" says chief marks, who is known for his tireless availability for community events that take him out at least three nights a week and once on weekends the other deputies try to spell him off but as marks puts it, """"this is not a -hour-a-week job and if you don't understand that you shouldn't take it""""
he confirms that he will be stepping down in the near future """"i have my sights set, i know when i'm leaving,"""" he says, but he won't name the date as president of the canadian association of chiefs of police, his terms lasts until the group annual convention in hamilton this september most officers expect marks to announce then that he is heading into the sunset
marks is not likely to have much input into the selection of his successor attorney general ian scott is known to have been furious when toronto police laid charges against dr henry morgentaler and two other doctors at abortion clinics in the fall of 
a day before, scott had informed marks of a stay of proceedings until the supreme court ruled on earlier charges with scott having a strong influence on deliberations for the new chief, the decision is likely to come down to a strategic choice designed to take the heat off the ontario government
with the honeymoon over for premier david peterson regime, queen park doesn't want more problems emanating from the marble mansion of metro finest

""""they've been complaining about the western music,"""" says ivy chong, manager of the blues club icehouse, located just up the street from the east gate of the forbidden city
it doesn't help that the nightclub's entranceway opens onto the xi la hutong and a collection of traditional courtyard houses as old, it seems, as china itself nor that attempts to trap the sound with thick velvet curtains has done little to keep the music from seeping into the neighbours' bedrooms
""""this alleyway tells the story of beijing,"""" says chong, a recent immigrant from singapore """"this is where the new world meets the old""""
it's the same story right across this capital city where preparations for the  olympic games are hurtling beijing decades ahead in time at the proverbial speed of light construction cranes clutter the horizon, historic landmarks such as the temple of heaven and the forbidden city are undergoing major restoration, olympic venues are rising from the dirt and a dizzying number of new high- rise apartments and offices are replacing aged eyesores
three subway lines are being added, a sleek new airport terminal is planned to welcome about three million tourists, athletes and officials to china's first olympic games already tourism is on the upswing, with beijing recording an almost  per cent jump - to  million overseas visitors - in the first four months of this year over the same period last year
the excitement seems to have been infectious many of beijing's  million residents have enrolled in """"olympic english"""" classes and are learning tips, thanks to a media-backed """"courtesy campaign,"""" on how to properly welcome the world
the program is aimed at changing """"impolite behaviour"""" - such as the annoying habit among men and women of spitting in the streets, says shao shiwei, a spokesperson for beijing's olympics organizing committee
by the time the opening ceremonies get underway at  pm on aug ,  - the triple eights signifying good fortune - about  per cent of this ancient city will have been restored, renovated or redeveloped
but chronic smog and traffic gridlock may prove harder to fix, despite efforts to move heavy industry out of the core and restrict cars coming into the city during the games
""""the olympics are very important for beijing,"""" says handel lee, the beijing lawyer behind icehouse and other surprisingly chic dining spots in this ,-year-old city """"they have changed, fundamentally, what this city is, not just in terms of the physical aspects, but in terms of what it believes itself to be
""""it is a chance for beijing to engage in a new direction and express itself for what it is and what it aspires to be in the future""""
in many ways, lee symbolizes that new beijing the -year-old chinese-american lawyer seems to delight in challenging china's communist party authorities and turning centuries of history on its ear
back in the early s, he bought a historic courtyard house overlooking the moat of the forbidden city, intending to turn it into his home but when he decided the location was too good to keep all to himself, he partnered with a group of investors, levelled the dilapidated structure and spent $ million (us) to construct a replica swoop-roofed building with enough room for a contemporary chinese art gallery, a western-style restaurant and second-floor cigar lounge
the novel venture proved so successful - thanks in large part to rave reviews for the talents of new york-trained chef rey lim - that the courtyard became a must-stop in beijing for the rich and famous, from bill clinton to michael jordan
recently, lee and partners launched a second venture just a block away in what was the cold-storage facility for the forbidden city during the qing dynasty
rbl and the adjoining icehouse is a """"lifestyle concept"""" and an """"experience,"""" says australian-born general manager richard xavia, who arrived recently from shanghai where he ran the highly successful three on the bund - a historic waterfront property containing restaurants, boutiques, an art gallery and spa in which lee is also a partner
""""this is probably the sexiest thing that beijing has ever seen,"""" says xavia of the upscale restaurant, bar and lounge (hence the name rbl) """"this is contemporary china
""""beijing is a fantastic place to be right now because china is starting to wake up we're here in the epicentre of the new china""""
lee is now working on another major dining/entertainment project in beijing, based on shanghai's three on the bund, and credits the """"incredible, experimental"""" design of many of beijing's new olympic venues for inspiring a growing number of business people in the ancient city to """"be bold, be daring, to take chances""""
""""china is a place where everything new is seen as very exciting so why do these insipid shopping malls and stores and restaurants that aren't very interesting?
this is a moment in history where things can be very creative and very exciting the pace of change is much faster and deeper now""""
almost everywhere you look, construction cranes and scores of chinese labourers are hard at work under the shadow, it seems, of the -metre-high olympics countdown clock that graces the entrance to the national museum of china overlooking tiananmen square
most of the work on some  olympic venues (there are another five slated for cities outside of the capital) is taking place north of the downtown core on the athletes' village, the so-called bird's nest olympic stadium and the national swimming centre, which looks like a massive water cube with bubbles
but there's also an unprecedented race to the  finish line taking place in the heart of the city where some  new office and apartment towers are under construction in the central business district and the ultra-modern """"egg shell,"""" the $ million (us) titanium-and-glass national grand theatre, is springing up next to the historic great hall of the people
beijing's rush to show the world it's a thoroughly modern metropolis is having profound spinoffs air canada, for instance, sees china as a major growth market and plans a threefold increase in passenger and cargo service it recently launched direct flights from toronto to beijing, which will run daily by , and plans to add non-stop toronto-shanghai service next summer
beijing's houhai bar district, on the shores of a picturesque lake of the same name just north of the forbidden city, has overtaken the sanlitun district as the hip new place to hang out and have a few drinks
its eclectic mix of restaurants, bars and shops back onto one of beijing's oldest hutongs (hundreds of these small lanes criss-cross the city) where dozens of rickshaws carry tourists back in time through dusty, narrow alleyways each day
while many of those old hutongs and courtyard homes have been demolished in recent years to make way for widened roads, lush boulevards and new high-rises, those remaining are now protected as historic landmarks and some are becoming upscale neighbourhoods - the equivalent of new york's brownstones - for china's fast- emerging middle- and upper-class
houhai (pronounced ho high) is a delightful waterfront strip of outdoor patios and open-air restaurants, overlooking a shoreline teeming with water lilies
it's a place where you're as likely to see elderly couples practising the chinese equivalent of ballroom dancing in the nearby public square as enterprising masseurs offering outdoor back treatments
factory , in an old industrial area on jiuxianqiao rd, has been gaining an international reputation as an art district with its sprawling galleries, social clubs, cafes and bookstores
and new restaurants and bars - well outside the traditional safety of the western-based hotel chains - are springing up all the time, some within steps of the courtyard and rbl in a strip of new storefronts, built to look like old courtyard houses, that officials are banking will create a comfort zone for many of the eateries and clubs you would find in new york, paris and london
chef rey lim marvels at beijing's transformation and the new attitude to the growing western-style presence in beijing's streets - a far cry from opening day at the courtyard when police showed up at  pm, three hours before the official opening, claiming the restaurant was holding """"a gathering of white people without a permit""""
it took hours before things could be sorted out, enough that most of the invited guests had given up and gone home
none of that stopped lee, of course as he would say later """"i've learned the hard way that it was better to ask for forgiveness than permission""""
""""handel is a visionary and he finds the right people to make his vision into reality,"""" says lim """"everything he touches now will turn to gold""""

2635981106,Today's letters: 'Right to read' inquiry recommendations miss the mark,Aucun(e) disponible.,"'right to read' recommendations too narrow
re: ontario schools need sweeping changes to help children learn to read: ontario human rights commission, march 
meeting the needs of students with reading disabilities was the focus of the """"right to read"""" inquiry of the ontario human rights commission (ohrc) the inquiry placed a needed spotlight on teaching students with reading disabilities and on preparing new teachers to teach literacy while all of us in schools and teacher education faculties support initiatives designed to help students, especially students who struggle with learning in school, we have concerns about the blinkered approach taken by the ohrc
the inquiry's recommendations would better serve ontario students if they reflected a thoughtful integration of multiple sources of research that use both large-scale and individual classroom data a more robust view of literacy teaching is needed, as teachers and researchers around the world recognize that there is no singular way to teach reading and writing that is effective for all students
the inquiry's recommendations are limited to narrow, rigidly defined perspectives of reading and ways to support students with reading disabilities because of these limitations, widespread generalizing of the recommendations to the diverse classrooms across ontario will be problematic the inquiry's goals cannot be met when their stated objectives conflict with their recommendations
shelley stagg peterson, professor at oise/university of toronto
teaching phonics not the only answer
the """"right to read"""" public inquiry recommends that the emphasis for kindergarten and grade one students should be on phonics now try to sound out """"right to read"""" how well did knowing phonics help you with that? reading english is not phonetical; it is visual if a child has a good visual memory, he or she will be able to read anything they can understand by the end of grade one it has nothing to do with intelligence
poor readers can have wonderful careers in many fields phonics is a useful tool in learning to read but it is not a method as one of my students said one day when i had written the word """"rough"""" on the board, """"that doesn't say rough it doesn't have an 'f' in it""""! that gave me a chance to teach my grade one, two, and threes that there are five different ways to pronounce """"ough""""
i also question the fairness of doing such a survey when most of the children were being taught virtually or at home due to covid- new provincial governments usually do some kind of overhaul of the curriculum but this seems like throwing the baby out with the bathwater just because something is new does not mean it is better i hope the government is generous with the materials needed to put the plan into place

canada hypocritical on ukraine
it's interesting to read headlines about prime minister justin trudeau and the liberals banning crude oil exports form russia, when in fact canada receives almost no crude oil from russia it makes us seem like a country that will do its utmost to support the ukrainian people unfortunately that is not the case and our government, representing us, is not prepared to really go all out to defend democracy and the ukrainian people
if it did, the government would have announced a ban on refined oil products from russia however, this would inflict a little pain on canadian citizens sad and what is even sadder is how our media has not emphasized the hypocrisy of our government, and really us, its citizens

how can nato just stand by?
i do not understand how nato can stand by and watch the carnage in a democratic european country shame on us helping ukraine with pea shooters is not help it needs the cavalry now, if not yesterday
be not afraid of vladimir putin's nuclear arsenal; his people will not let him use it they are not stupid
the future will show the ukrainian people hating us as much as the russians because we failed to act now waiting for the attack on poland, romania, lithuania, latvia, estonia or even finland is folly by us

never again - yet it happens again and again
as a canadian child of european immigrants who lived through the second world war in europe and england, i listened to the horrific stories of my parents' experiences and believed the world would never let that happen again after the war, alliances were formed, agreements made to more readily enable a united response against tyrants such as hitler no doubt without organizations like the united nations, latter th-century history would look quite different; we likely would see more and more devastating wars than we have seen - or perhaps we would not be here pondering
sadly though, crimes against humanity still have happened: syria, rwanda, uganda, iran, biafra to name a few and now vladimir putin's invasion of ukraine has been met with world condemnation, but still it is happening these alliances and rules designed to prevent us from blowing each other up feel frustratingly feeble in the wake of putin's attack and his threat of nuclear retaliation towards countries who try to help ukraine
putin's corruption is common knowledge, he has been robbing and murdering for  years, becoming one of the richest men in the world and he is not satisfied yet surely the whole rest of the world can stop him before he murders any more innocent people then, perhaps, we need to revisit the rules of our alliances

forty-four-year-old ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy, when presented with invasion by russian soldiers armed with rifles, tanks and missiles, stood outside his official residence in kyiv and told his citizens he would stand with them, if need be, to the end

isn't it past time to build another bridge?
hindsight is /, as the saying goes i moved my family to ottawa in , and since then there have been many rounds of discussion and study of additional bridges over the ottawa river the main concern has been safety and truck traffic through ottawa's core large trucks like the trucks occupying this city for three weeks
nimbyism obstructed progress, but now, with hindsight, would it not have made sense to have added at least one bridge over the river? that, together with permitted restrictions on large trucks in the city's core, might have mitigated the bullying ottawa experienced over those weeks

a proud albertan, no more
i'm from edmonton, i'm an albertan (third generation) i always thought it was one of my best features to be a true albertan meant:
 someone in your extended family still farmed, and in the summer you went to the farm for a holiday
 at least a couple members of your extended family earned their living in the oil and gas industries
 someone was a trucker
 everybody was hard-working and frugal when oil were down (you had to be - because when oil was up you spent like a drunken sailor)
 in the winter, you hunkered down and endured (unless oil prices were up; then you flew to los vegas or hawaii)
your version of eastern canada started at the manitoba/ontario border
but i'm no longer proud to be an albertan, i'm ashamed here's why:
 trucker organizer tamara lich does not speak for me
 trucker organizer pat king does not speak for me
 alberta premier jason kenney certainly does not speak for me
is it time for me to speak up for my friends and family in alberta? we want to comply with the safest covid protocols we support our children, be they gay, trans or otherwise we want freedom from the white-winged racists who seem to have so much power in the province they put the dumb in freedom

 governments must endorse more forcefully the concept that colleges are invaluable in providing the essential skilled personnel to sustain the mid-level infrastructure of our economic base, and demonstrate the political will to do something about it 
the country requires nothing less than a national strategy which a) addresses how canada can differentiate itself in competitive world markets, and b) implements programming to guarantee we will have the skilled workforce to be successful in selected sectors 
some recommended actions to support this process could include the following
develop a national people and skills strategy overseen by a high- level council comprising representatives from business, labour, government, colleges and universities
establish and co-ordinate a national network to facilitate both a national credit-transfer system to serve the mobile population, and prior learning and recognition standards, to enable adult learners to fast-track their learning requirements 
invest in enhancing our e-learning capacity  to allow increased access for adult learners, particularly in areas of skills shortages
 establish a staff development fund to allow existing bodies, particularly the universities, to conduct workshops for current college teachers to upgrade content currency, embrace new learning methodologies, and develop cultural diversity sensitivities
 provide incentives (through tax, tuition grants for upgrading credentials, etc) to encourage individuals to enter teaching, particularly in the areas of math, science, technology and the skilled trades
recognize that governments have underestimated the potential of the colleges' role in regional economic development, and to rethink this issue in pragmatic, rather than political, terms
accept that career public service officers in canadian embassies do not possess the requisite, hands-on, experiential backgrounds in post-secondary education, and establish international offices staffed by seasoned college professionals in such countries as india, china and the philippines such offices could assess and evaluate credentials, (and) match skill-sets to canadian requirements  before immigrants are admitted to canadaworth repeating",Toronto Star,2006-05-01,2006,5,1
352730545,Recovering the memory of a 'lost' Canadian war hero:   [Final Edition ],"I first heard of him in the early 1980s. In those days [Filip Konowal] was """"lost."""" Even among those who knew his name, most questioned who he was. There was no Ukraine when Konowal came to Canada, they said, only Imperial Russia. Ukrainians were just """"little Russians."""" Those claiming otherwise were pesky """"emigre nationalists."""" They ignored the fact that Konowal identified himself as Ukrainian. So I empathized with Konowal. They didn't want me to be a Ukrainian, either. In Ottawa's Notre Dame cemetery, where he has been since 1959, scarcely a trace of him could once be found, save for a small tablet flush to the ground. How ironic that Konowal lies not far from Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a good man who opposed branding Ukrainians and other Europeans as """"enemy aliens"""" during Canada's first national internment operations. Yet from 1914-20, thousands were herded into concentration camps, stripped of what little wealth they had and later disenfranchised. That happened as other Ukrainians, like Konowal, were loyally volunteering for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Some lied so they could enlist - by calling themselves Russians, for example. Still, something remained """"lost"""" - Konowal's Victoria Cross. Spokesmen for the Canadian War Museum vowed it had just been misplaced - that it had gone astray in their collection. We thought it was stolen, but couldn't prove it - until April 2, when we got an e-mail from Iain Stewart in England. He told us that Jeffrey Hoare Auctions of London, Ont., had Konowal's Victoria Cross up for sale.","i was standing over his grave when the verses came to me: """"i once was lost, but now i'm found was blind, but now i see through many dangers, toils and snares, i have already come; 'tis grace has brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home""""
how apt a devotional for a canadian hero, cpl filip konowal

across canada, and even in his ancestral village of kutkivchi, konowal was unrecalled, save for his name being inscribed at branch  of the royal canadian legion on toronto's queen street west
why should konowal have been better known? because he was a hero during the battle of hill  on aug -, , just beyond vimy ridge, konowal's exploits were so daring that his majesty, king george v, personally awarded him the victoria cross and he should have been better known because he was archetypically canadian: an immigrant, forest worker, soldier; a man who persevered through hard times, losing his first wife during the genocidal great famine of - in soviet ukraine he married a french-canadian widow, learned her language and worked as a janitor on parliament hill, never bragging about his victoria cross save for joking about how he'd learned to clean up with a mop, as once he'd mopped up with a rifle
mainly due to the legion's branch , a campaign to recover konowal's memory began in  much was done a proper headstone was consecrated trilingual historical plaques were unveiled at sites connected with his life: one at the toronto legion branch, whose honorary patron he is; another in the governor general's foot guards armoury in ottawa, home of the th regiment; a third in the armoury of the royal westminster regiment in richmond, bc, for he fought in the th's ranks; a marker at the ukrainian canadian centennial park in dauphin, manitoba
his bust even graces the village where descendants occupy the family home and a bas-relief will be unveiled next august near lens, france
with ukraine having re-emerged in europe, konowal is no longer called a russian curators and commentators alike concede that he was ukrainian canadian, and most acknowledge that ukrainians weren't russians - then, now or ever
still, something remained """"lost"""" - konowal's victoria cross spokesmen for the canadian war museum vowed it had just been misplaced - that it had gone astray in their collection we thought it was stolen, but couldn't prove it - until april , when we got an e-mail from iain stewart in england he told us that jeffrey hoare auctions of london, ont, had konowal's victoria cross up for sale
immediate steps were taken to have the royal canadian mounted police secure and authenticate that medal unquestionably, it is filip konowal's undeniably, it was filched from the museum, but by whom? where was it? that tale has yet to be told but thanks to cbc radio's geoff ellwand, we know that in the early s a well- dressed woman in her thirties took konowal's vc and a hawaiian silver dollar into a local coin dealer's shop told both were fakes, she sold them for $ and went away content

2304433854,Time to focus on inequality,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the toronto foundation's latest vital signs report, detailing the city's economic and social health, was released last week it says it """"reveals the harsh realities of a city facing increasingly entrenched inequality despite massive growth""""
but surely """"reveal"""" is the wrong word it suggests a curtain has been lifted and we've all learned something for the first time
sadly, that's not at all the case here
we know toronto's story is one of two solitudes one, where a small and affluent group is doing well and reaping the rewards of a booming economy the other, a much larger group, is struggling just to make ends meet the two groups are growing further apart, both economically and in their outlook on life
for years, the annual vital signs report has pointed to this problem traditionally, it relied on hard numbers - the good and the bad of life in toronto - to make its case last year's report included personal stories, the better to give hardship a human face
this year's version lands in the middle of an election campaign and seeks to push the issue of poverty and inequality to the forefront of the federal campaign so do three other reports released this month that also focus on rising concerns for those being left behind in toronto, ontario and all of canada
the campaign  report shows child and family poverty has dropped significantly across canada since  but problems still persist, with recent immigrant and indigenous children affected the most
the report by feed ontario, an association of food banks, finds that poverty rates among single adults and couples without children are rising because they haven't received the federal and provincial government benefit increases directed to families with children
the colour of poverty report points to growing racial inequalities, with indigenous peoples and people of colour facing higher rates of poverty and homelessness and poorer health and justice outcomes than their white counterparts
with a growing population and thriving economy, there's much to celebrate in toronto but, as all these reports make clear, there's a real problem when the benefits of wealth and opportunity are not shared by everyone
toronto leads the country when it comes to income inequality, according to vital signs between  and , the top  per cent have seen their net worth increase by an average of more than $, while the bottom  per cent averaged just $,
so, over more than a decade and half, some people have seen their wealth go up by the equivalent of a home while others have accumulated the equivalent of a living room furniture set
housing prices have skyrocketed and incomes haven't kept up
the report points to housing prices rising four times faster than income and rent rising twice as fast over the last decade and while unemployment is the lowest it's been in decades, the jobs are increasingly not very good ones
temporary jobs grew five times faster than permanent ones and part-time work twice as fast as full-time they come with little to no benefits or stability newcomers and racialized people disproportionately work in these precarious jobs that leave workers constantly at risk of plunging into poverty
when the federal parties talk about jobs on the campaign trail, it needs to be a conversation about good jobs when they talk about making life more affordable, they should be clear about who they're talking about and how they'll deliver
the vital signs report is a depressing but timely reminder that income and wealth are highly co-related with race, where people were born, and where they live now
none of that should define anyone's experiences or prospects for the future in a city as great as toronto

to blindness in one eye
while her sight was eventually restored three months later, other
symptoms followed -- tingling in her face, cramping in her hand and
leg -- always on her right side
in , a decade later, she received a diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis
""""i started to cry when i read it it was like a weight lifted off,""""
she said
her husband asked her if she was all right when leaving the
doctor's office
""""i am it's not all in my head,"""" she told him """"then, we both
stopped well, maybe it is and we both started to laugh -- because
it affects the brain,"""" she said
a couple years ago, michaud volunteered for a drug therapy that she
continues to receive injections for on a weekly basis the
interferon does not cure ms, but rather helps prevent the symptoms
of her central nervous system disease she doesn't see the
difference, but her family does
like many others with ms, she's pinning her hopes on a new theory
called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (ccsvi), developed
by italian dr paolo zamboni, that came to mainstream attention last
fall
she would like to volunteer to take part in trials
on june , the canadian and american ms societies will announce
the """"winners"""" of the competition for ccsvi trials
zamboni's idea has given hope to many and was part of the focus of
the sudbury chapter of the ms society of canada's first press
conference at its new centre for hope on wednesday
zamboni theorizes that ccsvi is a condition characterized by
blockages or narrowing in the veins leading to the brain, resulting
in blood flow patterns in the brain that eventually cause injury to
its tissue and degeneration of neurons
treatments involve trying to rid the veins of those blockages with
stents or angioplasty
""""in time, we want to see a trial here,"""" said laurel ireland, chair
of the sudbury chapter """"we certainly have the participant base we
also have to have a clinic for that""""
sudbury is a hot spot for ms, with rates dozen times higher than
canada's already super-elevated national average with one of the
highest prevalence rates in the world, an estimated , to ,
canadians have ms
""""when we did have an ms neurologist in to speak to us, he brought
up an interesting topic we always assumed it was because of what we
have in our air and water however, it may be a factor of
ethnicity,"""" ireland said
""""ms is a cold climate disease scotland, finland, northern europe
many of the places that are hot spots have immigrants from those
areas""""
the ms chapter only has statistics on those who have contacted it
for help -- around  in sudbury -- however, estimates place the
number who have the disease in the nickel city at about four times
that
because it is such a hot spot for ms, the chapter is working toward
establishing a ms clinic, based out of the sudbury regional
hospital, as there is none in northern ontario
""""we're hoping within two years we will see something concrete here
 not just for sudbury, but for the north,"""" ireland said
""""it will probably be a multidisciplinary clinic, not just for ms
 parkinson's, md a number of things can be helped by having a
specific neurological clinic""""
last week, there was an international conference focused on
zamboni's ccsvi
""""six months ago that would have been inconceivable,"""" laurel said
""""what it has meant to the ms population worldwide can be summed up
in one word: hope""""
zamboni's work first came to mainstream attention last october on
the television news programw
immediately, those with the disease began clamoring for trials and
exploration of possible treatments, a desire ms societies have
responded to
on june , the research projects will be announced and where
people can potentially participate in them
""""this is huge this is specifically for ccsvi,"""" ireland said """"i'm
proud that our canadian association was out front with this we are
in the middle of a campaign in canada, 'end ms' there is the
potential to end ms maybe in our generation probably in the next""""
it gives ireland, who has two family members with the disease,
chills to think about it funding for the projects will begin the
july 
""""by this time next year, worldwide, i think the landscape of ms is
going to be different,"""" said ireland
michaud has decided to volunteer for one she has always had
trouble with her right side and has experienced pain in her neck and
headaches, which give her hope blockages might be causing the
disease

the production, which continues today and sunday at tarragon theatre, had its beginnings three years ago, when trent university student billie mintz was drawn into raul dream and turned it into a play
``dancing is his special way of speaking,'' says mintz, scriptwriter turned playwright, as raul swings into spontaneous movement outside the theatre - a shuffle, a little tango, a hip-swivelling twist and a foot-stomping folk dance - just a small sampling of his repertoire
``canada unites all peoples,'' raul says, interrupting mintz ``it is the best democracy in the world''
at the time of their initial yonge st encounter, mintz, the thornhill student with video camera in hand, was doing his final essay on cultural studies as a movie
``i can teach them,'' raul confides, gesturing toward the -year-olds who make up the cast and crew of dancing with the fool ``i'm the father i tell them you just say (pointing to his brain), `i can, i can, i can' ''
mintz play is about a torontonian who thinks he can assist another less fortunate than himself to deal with the reality of canadian life he comes to accept a good part of raul more hopeful reality
``he has stepped over a certain line as far as dreams go,'' says mintz, as energetic in his own way as his subject ``normal has nothing to do with it it how strongly you believe in what you want: he more grounded than most people' ''
raul hooked into mintz with a grand scheme about getting  ``dancing girls,'' one from every ethnic group in the city, for a grand ``moolticooltural'' spectacle in nathan phillips square mintz found himself escorting raul to the mayor office and riding up to the eighth floor of cbc headquarters in search of the head of talent
in real life, mintz became the character he eventually wrote for himself, the promoter called leader in the play
``look at me now, i'm speaking to the toronto star about raul, world superdancer,'' mintz declares
the remarkably agile raul says his secret is a daily dose of royal jelly and ginseng,  oranges and lots of water with honey
he states his age as `` or younger'' with a big laugh but energy and agility aside, he has to be more than 
his full name is raul salas he came to canada seven years ago from lima, where he'd worked for his lawyer brother as a legal secretary he'd studied dance and read voraciously, mostly revolutionary philosophy how he transformed himself into a street performer remains a mystery
the -meter-long photo ``gallery'' he packs with him, in one of several cases he carries, is a complete documentary of his years on the pavement
preserved under cellophane and tape are polaroid shots of friends and fans, messages of good cheer, signs he drew for himself as ``the genius raul''
he is handing out handmade silver stars for every cast member, with their names on them
you won't find raul on yonge st these days he taking time out to concentrate on his other talents - painting, poetry, playing chess and teaching a series of instructional dance videos, multicultural dance, a collection of poems written to prime ministers - raul reach knows no limit
and now he an actor
living so much on his own plane, raul didn't seem at first to be the right candidate to play himself
``they've gone through three people to play raul, and (the actors) couldn't do it,'' says co-producer christopher byrne ``they were just too weirded out by what we were doing
``it because it walking a fine line of exploitation what worse? to walk by a man like this on the street? or stop and do something for him and live with the repercussions of what happens to raul when the play is over?''
raul doesn't want to talk about it, but he was beaten on the street and suffered harassment in the boarding house where he was living he now lives with mintz and the actor who plays leader, michael johnson
``he the most positive man that i've ever met in my life,'' says byrne, a belleville-born filmmaker he and mintz financed the play and the film through earnings as production assistants in toronto busy film production scene
mintz wonders whether raul isn't an outsider even in his own culture the dapper little dancer tells us he is divorced and shows pictures of his three sons, raul jr, , tony, , and rafael,  all three live and work in peru
the aboriginal elements in raul background come through strongly when he speaks of his mother, who died earlier this year he calls her his ``mother in the sky'' he says she occasionally sends a single word of advice when he meditates on her
``before dancing, women is my passion all women is supporting raul,'' says the star, stating his expectation of remarrying in canada
``the man art is himself,'' says mintz he offers a plug for the play, set in a doughnut shop where leader meets raul and learns to trade realities: ``if you ever want to see him again, you have to come to the tarragon theatre the whole play is about who is a fool''
everything in it, the playwright adds, is from actual conversations with raul and the experience has had some magic in it
the fool, the shaman, the trickster, the truthteller: raul, the man and the character, is all of these
``driving by in our cars and staring at raul, he the fool,'' says byrne
``but when he standing there, happy as he is and positive as he is, we're the fools because we're so burdened by our material worries''

april includes the anniversary of mass atrocities in rwanda, cambodia, kosovo, bangladesh, armenia and the holocaust in europe and the world faces continued mass atrocities and humanitarian crises in myanmar, yemen, the democratic republic of congo, syria, and elsewhere, national governments and the international community have failed to prevent war crimes and crimes against humanity, and continue to fail to act in the interests of the people who live there the world now faces the most significant forced displacement crisis since the second world war international law, including treaties such as the genocide convention and the refugee convention, is too often ignored or debated rather than respected and enforced
the national day, which was marked april  - and which i am very proud to have helped create through a unanimous parliamentary motion in  - falls annually on the birthday of canadian prime minister lester pearson it is a day to remember past crimes against humanity, but also to resolve to ensure that such crimes are prevented wherever possible, and that there is no impunity for perpetrators
this year, the canadian government should commit to helping fill the vacuum of political will that exists to prevent and end mass atrocities this includes the deployment of canadian peacekeepers where necessary and appropriate
however, the prevention of mass atrocities extends well beyond military responses it means supporting the use of a full range of canada's diplomatic, political, intellectual and economic resources to provide creative solutions to this global challenge as one example, canada is home to cutting-edge digital technology research and development; we should be thinking proactively about how to support the application of these technologies to atrocity prevention and accountability
with too many countries choosing isolation over engagement, canada must show resolve and leadership in many cases we have clear directions available, if only we choose to recognize and adopt them: as one example, bob rae's recent report on the rohingya should be taken up immediately by demonstrating willingness to act, canada can encourage and facilitate united action by a much broader set of like-minded countries this can be the basis for an inspired and collaborative effort not just to put canada in a seat at the united nations security council, but to reform the institution to ensure that no more victims of mass atrocities are ignored or left behind
some may say it is not our responsibility to get involved with complicated circumstances beyond our borders yet we are a country full of immigrants, of people who often came to canada from complicated circumstances the experiences of refugees and the oppressed are experiences in the lineages - if not the lives - of countless canadians we are a diverse people, and through our diversity we are connected to the world
our most shameful moments as a country have been our moments of exclusion - be it committing cultural genocide against our indigenous peoples, or turning back jewish, sikh and tamil refugees in their moments of need conversely, our proudest moments have been when we worked together, applying our diversity in all its strength to solve problems with imagination and dedication
canada can step up again and seize another moment, by committing to lead the world in the prevention of mass atrocities we owe it to those in need, and to ourselves

no, i'm not talking about municipal elections i'm talking about july , when performers in a visiting american circus picked a fight with the wrong guys in a brothel at king and jarvis sts and ended up with their tent in flames
this choice nugget of local history is being re-enacted in toronto circus riot, playing for the next two weeks on sterling rd in the junction triangle (just opposite the museum of contemporary art)
the show is the brainchild of circus artist and comedian angola murdoch, who chanced on the true story seven years ago while doing research on the orange order, which has a strong presence on the bruce peninsula where she owns property
""""i learned that the orangemen had a huge regime over all of ontario in the th century,"""" murdoch says
reading the story of a circus riot in toronto on an orange order website, she immediately pictured it as a circus performance: """"it played in my head like we're doing it this week,"""" she says
a maximum of  audience members per performance will move between different locations as part of the show, produced by murdoch's lookup theatre
under one tent, audiences meet a menagerie (played by human performers wearing kelsey carriere's wonderfully whimsical puppet costumes) and under another they watch a circus performance as might have been performed by the real-life sb howes' star troupe menagerie & circus back in 
audiences then follow a group of clowns down a laneway to an interior performance space representing a brothel, where they're served a toronto circus riot beer (or cream soda) and treated to a silks act by aerialists portraying some of the brothel's businesswomen the story continues to the riot itself and the trial that followed
the wrong guys that the howes clowns picked a fight with were firemen and members of the orange order, as were many law enforcement officials and city leaders at that time orangemen """"pretty much controlled toronto at that point,"""" explains script writer and performer reid janisse, so getting aggressive with those firemen """"was not a good choice""""
the clowns won the brawl, so the next day the firemen rounded up some friends and went to the circus tent looking to even the score: """"they beat people up, they set the tent on fire and they set all the animals free,"""" janisse says
the show is based on murdoch's research in newspaper archives, particularly those of the globe (now the globe and mail), which covered these events heavily the riot devastated the howes company: with much of their equipment destroyed, they cut their tour short and headed back to new york state
toronto, too, """"really changed in the aftermath"""" of the riot, murdoch says members of the police force who were orangemen were seen watching the melee, but not stepping in to help, and the case went to court nine times the next toronto mayor to be elected was, unusually, not in the orange order and he undertook a total cleanup of the police force
the orange """"regime fell after ,"""" says murdoch, and toronto """"became more multicultural not in the sense that we say multicultural today, but catholics and welsh, different people started to move into the city""""
the show is being staged at a moment of transition for its immediate community: """"sterling is really changing right now,"""" says murdoch, who's lived in the bohemian enclave for  years
many organizations that are part of the neighbourhood's new business improvement association are contributing to the show: the special beer is made by henderson brewing company, the posters were screen-printed by repetitive press and rehearsals were hosted by mosaic yoga local developer castlepoint numa is donating the use of the lot where the circus tents are located
the show is funded by all three levels of government (national, provincial and local) and most of the -member cast have been involved in its development for a number of years
they're representative of murdoch's dual background in comedy and circus: half """"are circus people: acrobats, jugglers and clowns"""" explains janisse, who met murdoch at second city, """"and the other half are improvisers, sketch comedians and standup comedians""""
working alongside each other has given each cohort """"a real appreciation for each other's skills,"""" he says; the comedians are impressed by the circus artists' training, while the circus folk marvel at the comedians' capacity for improvisation the multi-arts nature of the company, as well as the show's basis in narrative makes it """"very representative of an ontario voice of circus,"""" says aerialist and circus entrepreneur holly treddenick, who performs in the show """"whereas quebec is very rooted in high performance training, this show is rooted in theatricals and dramaturgy and storytelling""""
the whole thing is accompanied by a live score played by composer matthew reid, who's programmed some brass patches into his keyboards to emulate the sounds of the military brass band that toured with the howes troupe
watching the artists rehearse as research for this story, i felt like i'd stepped out of our city's contemporary hubbub (raptors who?) into a different world, where stilt-walkers become giraffes and kids run around in laneways, safe in their community as night falls on sterling this week and next, the transformation will continue and time will double back to some  years ago, when a bunch of professional jokesters turned our city on its ear

montreal - john a macdonald considered the quebec question  years ago and arrived at his answer
""""the only remedies are immigration and copulation,"""" he wrote in , """"and these will work wonders""""
macdonald was considering the minority situation of the english in what had been lower canada
but his solution also addresses the dilemma of modern-day quebec
while the country and the province seem preoccupied with constitutional cartography, it is the juicy business of populating that will decide quebec survival as a distinct entity
with that in mind, quebec struck a deal with the federal government, gaining, since april, exclusive authority to select one-quarter of all immigrants to canada who aren't refugees or joining family members
ultimately, quebec is proposing a substantial jump in immigration levels and a doubling of the percentage who are francophones on the home front, it has boosted its baby bonus family incentive payments to $, for the production of third and subsequent children
both options, producing babies or welcoming immigrants, have surface appeal
what can be more uplifting than contributing to the rosy glow of nationhood through the uninhibited removal of barriers?
stresses and strains, though, are inherent in both
they are inexact exercises unruly emotions are unleashed it is nigh impossible to predetermine balance, content or ultimate destination without binding one constitutional freedoms
quebec dilemma, then, is this: unless quebecois increase their birth rate, the """"pure laine"""" francophone population will wither the alternative is immigration, which has an equal potential to change quebec
""""i think it very much a debate in this province whether it reasonable to expect to build a country by immigration,"""" says cynthia lam, director of the chinese family service of greater montreal
""""it not shared by everybody that this is the way to go,"""" says lam, whose office, appropriately, is in a creaking brick building on the fringe of chinatown and the business district new families from hong kong, for example, find their business expertise and investment capital welcomed, but not their lack of french and their rudimentary understanding of quebecois culture
""""a double message is coming across,"""" says lam
those fears were included in an infamous taskforce report to federal multiculturalism minister gerry weiner this spring """"in quebec, racism is alive and well, living under the guise of quebec nationalism,"""" it said
lam was among nine authors of the report she says that statement represented the view of a tiny minority
what distresses her is that the english and french grabbed that one phrase and proceeded to bludgeon each other while ignoring the legitimate grievances of ethnic quebec
it is clear to lam as it is to silvana anania, director of community development for montreal ymca, that ethnics can't sit out this round of constitutional debate as they have in the past
the ethnic component is too great, they have too much at stake this is not just a french-english debate, says italian-born anania """"the minority groups are a bit tired of being swung one against the other""""
bruno is riding the train home to sherbrooke, que
he is a francophone and a federalist, one who feels that the province will separate because the """"socialists"""" in politics, the media and the arts wish it so
""""immigrants?"""" he says, sipping red wine as the dining car rocks through the quebec countryside """"do you mean good immigrants or bad immigrants?""""
it does not matter to bruno whether an immigrant arrives speaking french, he says a good immigrant, though, is probably european
certainly, it is one willing to assimilate; one who didn't pack old-country religious or ethnic rivalries in the luggage
elements of his view - hardly unique to one region of canada - are shared by the very people bruno loathes, quebec nationalist intellectuals
consider best-selling author yves beauchemin plea for french uniligualism before the belanger-campeau commission on quebec future
""""simply, because two cultures can't both bloom in the same linguistic space,"""" he said """"quebec, after all, isn't elastic""""
putting the issue in context requires some facts:
about  per cent of quebec population of  million is francophone anglophones and allophones (whose mother tongue is neither english nor french) split the remainder
quebec, which represents about one-quarter of the canadian population, draws just  per cent of the country immigrants about  per cent go to ontario
between -, about  per cent of quebec immigrants spoke neither english nor french,  per cent spoke english, almost  per cent spoke french,  per cent spoke both
a stunning  per cent of all immigrants settle in montreal
quebec city, the capital, is overwhelmingly francophone indeed, it is one of the more homogeneous major cities in north america ethnic minorities are grossly under-represented in the public service
quebec nationalism is weaker among ethnics
put bluntly, some in the ethnic community get mixed signals """"we need you,"""" the message starts """"but do we want you?""""
lech leskiewicz, his wife, anna, and their two daughters, marta, , and katarzyna, , are bruno sort of """"good immigrant""""
both parents were professionals in poland, she a food scientist, he a veterinarian although the family is multilingual - lech speaks seven languages - they have found their four years in montreal a tough adjustment
anna has landed a job in her field lech is still writing tests and completing upgrades in an attempt to have his credentials accepted here
""""the whole last year i was cleaning cages for the animals, with seven languages,"""" he says with a flash of irritation """"you can talk to the animals in any one - in french, in italian, in polish, in german whatever you want""""
recently, the family became canadian citizens in part, this is insurance, for lech says they are worried about their future in a separate quebec
""""we came here in order to be canadians not to be, i don't know, quebecois; or not to be an ontarian or a british columbian no
""""europe is uniting itself here is something wrong, i think so because the strength is in unity not in separation""""

the -year-old electrician and father of seven came to montreal from trinidad in  he became a canadian citizen in jauary recently he returned to another citizenship court, just to watch
he wants a whole canada he has loved the country since boyhood, because his favorite pastor in trinidad was a canadian
""""all the things that he stands for,"""" says osborne, """"i realized that canada stands for these things also""""
he chose montreal when the time came because friends said a multicultural society could flourish in its soil
for the most part they are right, he says, adding a caveat """"we do have soil erosion""""
immigrants can sense things in the turbulent winds of nationalism that are often lost on the rest of canada
they smell the insecurities, the humiliations, the hypersensitivity to threats real and imagined they too are trying to root themselves
""""i understand how diffichlt it is for a society undergoing its own transformation and stamping its own identity on its structures,"""" says anania
'""""we are not a melting-pot society,' they say i sympathize with that greatly but on the other hand, i don't sympathize with it when it becomes a total denial of reality""""

241132700,Lifting the lid on Quebec's constitutional posturing; The Parti Qubcois' demand for a provincial charter is dismissed as a mere gimmick by some. But what is preventing the creation of such a document? Andrew Thomson finds out.:   [Final Edition ],"The PQ wants a formal constitution that would """"set forth the fundamental values of the Quebec nation, establish Quebec citizenship, present its national symbols, enshrine human rights and freedoms and fundamental linguistic rights, and describe Quebec's parliamentary, government and judicial institutions,"""" according to Bill 195, the Quebec Identity Act. """"At the end of the day, (B.C.) did the minimalist approach so it wouldn't require a laborious rewriting of all kinds of statutes,"""" Mr. [Michael Behiels] said. """"I don't think that's the intent of the PQ."""" Other provinces haven't yet followed B.C.'s example, though Mr. [Peter Hogg] said the federal acts creating Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are already """"quite detailed provincial constitutions."""" And the 1867 British North America Act, Canada's basic constitution until the early 1980s, contained long passages on the original four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.","  the parti quebecois' latest push for a quebec constitution may be more of a political ploy than anything else, experts say, but it's legal under the constitution
with a weary sigh, most canadians remember the titanic struggles over the federal constitution during the past quarter-century, from pierre trudeau and rene levesque to the meech lake and charlottetown accords
but provincial constitutions? they exist -- sort of political scientist nelson wiseman wrote in  that they """"barely dwell in the world of the (canadian) subconscious they are too opaque, oblique, and inchoate to rouse much interest, let alone passion""""
the united states, australia, and most of western europe have written constitutions for their states they're legal under canada's political system as well, but rare only british columbia has one, passed during the s
other provinces have considered the move, but still retain less formal constitutions that exist more as an abstract collection of canada's founding documents and the scores of statutes, legislative rules, customs, and conventions that stretch back centuries within the british parliamentary tradition
now the opposition pq wants a written charter for quebec, though the concept was obscured last week by more controversial proposals on language rights and quebec citizenship in legislation tabled by leader pauline marois
the pq wants a formal constitution that would """"set forth the fundamental values of the quebec nation, establish quebec citizenship, present its national symbols, enshrine human rights and freedoms and fundamental linguistic rights, and describe quebec's parliamentary, government and judicial institutions,"""" according to bill , the quebec identity act
the bill has virtually no chance of becoming law, with the pq holding less power than the liberals and l'action democratique du quebec after a disappointing third-place finish in march's election that hasn't stopped constitutional experts from questioning the pq's motives
""""if it weren't for the context of wanting to stimulate eventual secession, there wouldn't be anything unusual or surprising about a province wanting to bring its constitution up to date,"""" peter hogg, a retired york university law professor, said
""""what they're planning to do is presumably have a more modern provincial constitution that could, in principle, serve as the constitution of a sovereign state in due course""""
the proposal isn't even new, said michael behiels, a university of ottawa history professor a quebec constitution has been bandied about since the quiet revolution of the s
""""are they just pulling together conventions? are they trying to rejig the system away from a constitutional democracy?"""" mr behiels asked """"one would have to see in great detail the fine print of the whole thing""""
section  of the  constitution act allows provincial legislatures to amend their own constitutions but anything violating the federal constitution, including the charter of rights and freedoms, would likely be overruled by the supreme court of canada, mr behiels said
bc had considered a similar formal document since the s, but the  constitution act is a technical document that reads more like robert's rules of order than the flowery themes of liberty and democracy touted by ms marois
""""at the end of the day, (bc) did the minimalist approach so it wouldn't require a laborious rewriting of all kinds of statutes,"""" mr behiels said """"i don't think that's the intent of the pq""""
other provinces haven't yet followed bc's example, though mr hogg said the federal acts creating manitoba, saskatchewan and alberta are already """"quite detailed provincial constitutions"""" and the  british north america act, canada's basic constitution until the early s, contained long passages on the original four provinces: ontario, quebec, new brunswick and nova scotia
not that discussions haven't occurred, especially where anti- federal sentiment runs deep albertans seeking more autonomy from the federal government have championed a formal constitution, which would replace the alberta act of , as one of several """"firewall"""" options
in quebec, a homegrown constitutional project has long been desired by many pequistes they repeated the idea during the  election campaign, seeking to lure those mr behiels refers to as wanting to eliminate """"vestiges of british imperialism in canada""""
but the province's usual mix of nationalism, language, and politics has grown more intense in recent months over the question of minorities and new immigrants, with the bouchard-taylor commission touring towns big and small to discuss reasonable accommodation
last week's announcement by ms marois was """"dusted off"""" as a strategic thrust against the adq's growing popularity with soft nationalist voters, said daniel weinstock, a political philosophy professor at the universite de montreal
""""the pq is risking being crowded off the chessboard because the adq has had a very clear line that they've been able to make a lot of political hay on,"""" he noted
constitutions in canada once simply meant the will of parliament, as remains the case in britain what's being proposed by the pq meets the th-century trend of constitutions expanding to include individual and collective rights above the grasp of politicians, mr wiseman, who teaches at the university of toronto, said
however, generations of political evolution, expressed in law and custom, would remain as powerful complementing forces
as for the pq's concept of quebec """"citizenship"""" released in tandem with the constitutional proposal, failing to learn french would bar new immigrants from running in school board, municipal and provincial elections, raising funds for political parties or petitioning the legislature as citizens canadian citizenship would still be sufficient to vote
experts say the plan would be hard-pressed to survive a legal challenge
""""for the time being, it's a purely symbolic thing,"""" mr weinstock said """"citizenship is not a provincial jurisdiction""""

in the ongoing wrangle over whether canada is, or is not, experiencing a brain drain to the us - a debate mired in contradictory numbers and interpretations - ottawa first dismissed the alarm-sounders as tax-cut zealots, then moved on to a second defensive tack
as in:
even if there is a steadily growing exodus of canadian professionals and high-tech workers (and we don't believe there is) but even if, it doesn't matter because for every one departee, there are four just as qualified immigrants coming in from around the world
or as prime minister jean chretien put it last month, """"we're importing lots of brains""""
statistics canada was there with the numbers: yes, at least ,, probably more, university graduates left annually for the us between  and , but , educated newcomers arrived each year to replace them
more to the point, their level of schooling was higher than canadians as a whole: almost  per cent had bachelor degrees compared with  per cent of the homegrown; more than  per cent had advanced degrees, versus just  per cent of canadian-born
so, statistically, we're ahead of the game brain drain? try brain gain
end of debate?
not by a long shot
""""you can argue over the numbers, but not the trend,"""" says mahmood iqbal, a conference board of canada research economist who last month issued a report with a double-edged title, are we losing our minds?
""""the brain drain is real,"""" he says """"it rising, and rising at an increasing rate""""
to claim that it being offset at a ratio of four to one by equally qualified immigrants is, to put it mildly, misleading, he adds
""""it assumes that professionals from the rest of the world are perfect substitutes in terms of education, experience, skill and training""""
they are not: """"there can be a big difference in university education you're lucky if one of the four is equal""""
iqbal cites his own background in india, where the length of time it takes to get a degree varies from place to place a ba takes two years, not three like here, he says, and the quality among universities varies wildly
when he came to canada for a master degree in economics, he first had to take basic courses he hadn't received back home """"there are about , universities in india, but only six or seven equivalent to here there are no equivalents in pakistan or bangladesh""""
that partly why ontario, which receives the largest share of the country immigrants, educated and otherwise, is now in the process of creating an academic assessment service to examine the education systems in  countries and rate them against provincial standards
and it why, for the past decade, the canadian council of professional engineers has been doing its own analysis of university programs and engineering institutes in some  countries it sent one evaluation team to several chinese provinces last year, and will dispatch a second to other areas in 
the council has mutual recognition agreements with several countries, says council president dan lavert, """"but with others, we have to determine if they're on the same playing field""""
he sympathizes with highly experienced immigrant professionals, but """"when the education system they've come from is dissimilar, we can't take their degrees at face value""""
ottawa four-to-one replacement mantra aggravates many economists and university officials, who say it misses the point
according to don devoretz, co-director of the centre for research on immigration at simon fraser university, they think it one of the main reasons canada hasn't been able to gain a strategic, early advantage in the high-tech field
""""recent graduates are leaving, leading scholars are moving, and the country ability to attract qualified replacements through immigration has been eroded,"""" he says
but attempts to draw attention to that fact are being drowned out in the statistical debate over whether or not there even is a brain drain it depends on who doing the counting
in a paper devoretz wrote last year for the cd howe institute, he, like the conference board, concluded there is: """"it real and it costly""""
by his calculations, more than  per cent of post- graduates, many with advanced degrees, have emigrated to the us the brain drain may be small, as statscan insists, relative to the total stock of highly skilled people in the country, but it not small relative to the size of recent graduating classes (fifty per cent of his own recent economics phd students have headed south, he notes)
some of devoretz other disquieting findings: in the seven years before the  free trade agreement, the outflow of professionals averaged , a year; in the seven years after, it jumped  per cent to , a year
the exodus rate for managers in that period rose a whopping  per cent, with more than  per cent of workers on intracompany temporary transfers converting to permanent residence
statscan, however, continues to maintain that at the overall """"macro-level,"""" there is no problem, though it concedes there are pockets of concern with computer scientists, managers, engineers and, in particular, physicians
no one disputes there is an increase in the number of canadians working in the us on free trade-related visas but just how large it is is still anyone guess and statscan doesn't like to guess
it claims the us visa data used by its critics in their estimates is unreliable, making no distinction between, say, florida- bound """"snowbirds"""" and in-and-out business visitors, and temporary work permit-holders
scott murray, director of the agency centre for education statistics, says it just doesn't know how many temporary departees are converting to permanent status: """"it too early to tell""""
nor does it know how many are working for american branches of canadian firms, and thus producing economic benefit for canada and it won't know those numbers until the next us census in 
according to the conference board, however, us immigration officials are claiming up to  per cent of temporary workers are applying for permanent status after two years not that they have to yearly nafta permits can be renewed indefinitely, and these days washington is only too happy to do so
temporary, not just permanent, exits have to be tracked to get a true picture of what happening, says mahmood iqbal - something statscan isn't fully doing
""""you can't use the traditional definition of migration when it comes to canada and the us all immigrants into canada are permanent, but  per cent of those leaving it are 'temporary' """"
the universities, meanwhile, wish the debate would move beyond warring numbers or definitions of """"temporary""""
""""the point that keeps getting missed,"""" says safwat zaky, chair of university of toronto electrical engineering department, """"is that the people who are leaving are the most able""""
they're not only at the top end of the scale in their various fields, """"they're the ones with leadership and entrepreneurial skills canada needs them when they go, the loss can't just be counted in numbers""""
recent immigrants may be technically qualified, zaky says, but in areas such as digital design, micro-electronics, information technology - economic must-haves for any country hoping to compete globally now, let alone in the future - they are far behind
""""north america is way ahead of the rest of the world in these areas the immigrants' level of expertise is not the same as someone educated here and nor are their language skills they have to undergo further education and training""""
not a week goes by these days without a """"retention battle,"""" says adel sedra, u of t vice-president and provost
the university recently lost a highly respected scientist in the field of artificial intelligence (albeit to britain, not the us) two other faculty stars, an astrophysicist and a specialist in electrical and computer engineering, also departed, to princeton and brown university respectively
it did succeed in keeping a renowned theoretical astronomer who was being wooed by the university of california at berkeley but only because the canadian institute for advanced research agreed to kick in money to increase his salary and research budget
with government funding cuts in recent years, the university on its own is usually unable to up the financial ante it getting harder to keep the best canadian scientists, scholars and researchers, sedra says, much less attract international high- fliers, the truly high-end intellectual immigrants
""""sometimes we win, more often we don't it demoralizing when we lose these people they're full professors, stars in their fields it also hampers the recruitment of top-flight new people when it gets known they've left""""
u of t, like other universities, is also watching more of its top graduates in information technology, science and economics being scooped by us schools and industry
micro-electronic, high-tech companies such as xilinx and altera are up here recruiting every spring, offering innovative, challenging work environments and much higher compensation
""""lower taxes aren't the issue, it the salaries,"""" he says
students may go with every intention of returning, but once into the high-reward american system, they find it difficult to leave indeed, a stats can study of , graduates who moved to the us in  found that two years later,  per cent were still there
the us is investing heavily in human capital, sedra says, and has increased its expenditure per student if canada instead intends to rely on an influx of immigrant brains to make its economy battle- ready for the next century, it dangerously misreading what going to be needed
""""new immigrants are not equal replacements you can't just count the number leaving versus the number coming in, and say we're gaining that only a numbers gain""""
statscan murray, who was proffering the four-to-one brain-gain argument in recent weeks, is not reluctant to retreat when the subject turns to quality, not quantity
""""of course, they are not clear substitutions,"""" he says """"it would be irresponsible to say they are, and i'm not denying there are quality differences""""
in mainstream computer science, however, the only area statscan has closely studied (through census data), immigrant programmers and systems analysts appear to be competing well, representing  per cent of the employment growth in that field what more, murray adds, they're being paid equivalently to canadian-born workers
but the census didn't ask how long it took them to get to that point the general rule with previous generations of skilled immigrants has been that it takes at least  years to achieve earnings parity with the canadian-born devoretz doesn't believe that holds true for current arrivals from new-source countries in southeast asia and eastern europe
""""whatever statscan says, they're not making the same earnings the people we're bringing in are not performing (economically) up to the standards of those who are leaving""""
immigrants also come with what he calls """"churning"""" costs to canadian taxpayers - administrative and settlement expenses, language training, education or skills upgrading - that can exceed the value of their credentials
they are not clear replacements for canadian-educated professionals heading to the us because canada isn't recruiting clear replacements, devoretz says he goes so far as to suggest the immigration department should no longer be handling the selection process
""""why not give a company, like nortel,  visas to target professionals with the right qualifications and skills, people they know can get certified? immigration can still check them out otherwise
""""or do what new zealand doing pay a bonus to the highly qualified to come back home""""
do something, he says, because canada is facing a major problem: a brain gain in numbers only

The meat on theagenda is money-- how to get more, where to spend what's there andhow to whip a $12.5-billion budget shortfall not expected to returnto black for another two years. All of that as the Liberalgovernment tries to hammer out new contracts with doctors, teachers,civil servants and more. Debora Van Brenk quizzed deputy premier DebMatthews, the treasury board president in charge of reining in thepurse strings, on what to expect.; ONTARIO POLITICS",Aucun(e) disponible.,"on the agenda

can best fill ontario job gaps

could include lower municipal speed limits

augment canada pension plan contributions would be split equally
between employers and employees, up to % each (% total) on

greenback grief
ontario's latest budget assumes a canadian dollar worth  cents
us but the loonie is now closer to  cents, with some analysts
seeing it fall to the -cent range since much of ontario's
borrowing is in us dollars, including $ billion this year
alone, that means even higher interest and debt costs
  on her insistence any contract increases have """"net zero"""" impact
on budgets
matthews: that doesn't mean, necessarily, no increases, but what it
means is any increase has to be offset by another kind of shift  
 this is tough stuff    hard for workers, for the unions i
think people have to recognize the price of not achieving balance is
increasingly higher (debt) interest payments
  on whether new realities will throw off plans to eliminate
ontario's deficit by 
matthews : people need to know eliminating a deficit is hard work
but we've got a plan    we're looking hard at the underground
economy, making sure we're collecting the unpaid taxes    we're
looking at our real-estate portfolio    in the past we tended to
look only at incremental increases in spending now, what we are
doing is saying we are going to look line by line through every
minister's budget and they'll be challenged to ask, are we getting
the best possible outcomes, the best possible value for this money?
  that's still a go-fast plan in a few short years for a very
large deficit, isn't it?
matthews: well, we've got a majority (government) and we're very
thankful for that because it does give us the runway we need to
drive that change
  on the impact of a much lower dollar and slower economic
growth, neither predicted in this year's budget
matthews: we're leading the country in economic growth, but as one
of them said, 'don't get too excited, you're winning a race of
turtles'we're still recovering from the recession

matthews: when people say we can't and we shouldn't do it, i say,
'do you think we should eliminate the canadian pension plan
altogether? 'and they go, 'oh, of course not' (i ask) 'do you think
cpp is adequate?' 'no, it's not' so if they support adequate cpp
but they believe it's inadequate, then there's only one way to
address that and that is to enhance (pensions)
  on whether liberals are making any headway on their commitment
to end poverty:
matthews: a single mom with two little kids, working a full-time,
minimum-wage job: her income when we started (in ) would have
been under $, she actually would have been better off on
social assistance than working that full-time minimum-wage job
today, a single mom, with two little kids (and) working a
minimum-wage job is earning $, and she's way better off than
she would have been on social assistance we've lifted almost ,

three other canadians, sgt-maj fw hall, lieut robert shankland and cpl leo hall all won vcs in the first world war and all came from winnipeg's pine street, renamed valour road the very first canadian to win a vc was upper canada's lieut alexander dunn, one of the sabre-wielding crimean war hussars who galloped in into the """"valley of death"""" in the  charge of the light brigade at balaclaca
the last canadian to win it was rcn pilot lieut robert hampton gray, of trail, bc on aug ,  -- the day the atomic bomb was dropped on nagasaki -- lieut gray, in his corsair dive-bomber, attacked a japanese navy destroyer at onagawa wan, japan
he came under heavy enemy fire and his plane burst into flames he held his course, came to within  metres of the ship and dropped one his bombs down the ship's smoke stack the vessel exploded and sank in four minutes lieut gray's plane was last seen crashing into the sea the wreckage and his remains were never recovered
""""the americans, rightly so, make so much of their history and we don't,"""" says daniel glenney, of the canadian war museum, which owns  vcs, many of which are on display """"we've got stories every bit as interesting, even more exciting at times""""
his favourite is that of vc winner william johnstone milne, a native of scotland who came to canada and ended up fighting at vimy ridge on april , , with the th battalion
""""the canadian advance,"""" said mr glenney, """"was being held up by german machine gun positions so he took a bag of hand grenades and knocked out the first machine gun nest then he went and knocked out the second he was killed trying to knock out the third, but that gave the canadians a gap in the line when the battle was over, they went back to try and find his body it just had disappeared in the mud, they had no idea where it was
""""he was a farm labourer, he was an immigrant, you know, the kind of person who was going to build this country and he was snuffed out as a young man and that was it
""""we tend to sort of be down on ourselves at times but i think that story kind of shows the positive side of the country""""
another canadian vc story is that of john robert osborn, a company sergeant-major with the winnipeg grenadiers during the second world war
born in norfolk, england, he fought in the first world war, was gassed and later captured for a brief period he came to canada and worked on the railroad, worked at farming and joined the militia he had a wife and three children
on dec , , he found himself in hong kong fighting the japanese """"he was with his men in a slit trench trying to stop the attack and he was catching grenades and tossing them back,"""" said mr glenney """"one of the grenades, he couldn't get at it fast enough he realized it was going to go off, so (he shouting a warning), jumped on it and smothered it he was killed but he saved the whole trench full of men""""
""""smokey"""" smith's heroism with the seaforth highlanders is described in the book, the canadians in italy:
"""" `c' company was already under fire from the approaching enemy tanks as pte smith led his piat (projector, infantry, anti-tank) team across an open field to a roadside ditch, which offered the close range he needed almost at once a mark v came rumbling down the road, sweeping the ditches with its machine-guns, and wounding smith's companion
""""at a range of only  feet, and exposed to the full view of the enemy, pte smith fired his piat the bomb stopped the panther, and its driver made frantic but futile efforts to turn around and retreat
""""immediately,  german infantrymen tumbled off the back of the tank and charged smith with machine pistols and grenades without hesitation he moved into the centre of the road, shot down four men with his tommy gun, and dispersed the remainder
""""a second tank now opened fire from a safe distance and more grenadiers began closing on smith, but the intrepid highlander met this second threat just as steadfastly replenishing his ammunition from his wounded comrade in the ditch he continued protecting him, fighting off the enemy with his sub-machine gun until they gave up and withdrew in disorder""""
says mr smith today: """"it wasn't fun (but) it's your job i always figured (i would survive) either that or i wouldn't know any different anyway"""" after the war, he left the army only to rejoin in  so he could fight in korea the army refused """"you're not supposed to fight anymore once you get a vc, you're taken out if you're alive so they wouldn't let me go""""
instead, he was made a celebrity recruiter he got out of the regular army, at the rank of sergeant, in  and opened a successful travel agency in vancouver, where he lives today he also became a volunteer roving ambassador for canadian veterans and in  was named a member of the order of canada for his volunteerism
the victoria cross """"changes your life dramatically,"""" he said """"it opens a lot of doors in business it opened doors, i made a lot of contacts"""" (of the current war in yugoslavia, he says this: """"you don't have to go war now, you can see it on tv i think they're going to have to put in ground troops it always comes right down to the old foot slogger, you know that's the only way you can win these things"""")
lt-col merritt's gallantry occurred as his south saskatchewan regiment was attempting to advance on a bridge at the disastrous raid on the french port town of dieppe on aug ,  cbc war correspondent wallace reyburn, present during the battle, later described it this way: """"the bridge was about  yards long, really kind of a causeway it was wide and had no balustrades that made it very exposed on a hill across the river was a high concrete fort, its guns all trained on the bridge the river was in flood and the bridge was the only way to get across apart from swimming
""""i saw the first men try to get across great chunks of concrete flew in the air -- mortar shells exploding bullets pinged off the road in a minute or two, what had been a smooth concrete road was gashed with craters and pockmarked with bullet holes our men were mowed down
""""striding up the road unhurried, revolver dangling from his hip, came lt col cecil merritt, the saskatchewans' co as he reached us he took his tin hat off and wiped sweat from his forehead it was a hot, steamy day he asked what the trouble was someone said: `this bridge is a hot spot, sir we're trying to get across it'
"""" `now men,' he said, `we're going to get across follow me don't bunch up together, spread out here we go!' erect and bare- headed, he strode forward onto the bridge his helmet hung from his wrist as he walked as i watched him lead his men through that thundering barrage, i felt a quiver run up and down my spine i'd never seen anything like it""""
in the ensuring battle, the -year-old lt-col merritt was twice wounded despite that, his victoria cross citation notes: he """"continued to direct the unit's operations with great vigour and determination and while organizing the withdrawal, he stalked a sniper with a bren gun and silenced him he then coolly gave orders for the departure and announced his intentions to hold off and `get even with' the enemy (later)"""" he was later captured by the germans and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner
says mr glenney: """"you talk to these men and they're there at the time and there's something that has to be done there's two types of people in the world, the leaders and the followers and i guess if you're someone in col merritt's position and your men are looking up to you, you've got a job to do and you do it he certainly did his job that day i think he said to one of our staff one time, `well, they just made me so mad' """"
dr butson clearly remembers the night he won his george cross in  at the age of  then a british citizen, he was a member of the royal army medical corps and had joined a british expedition exploring the antarctic on the night of july -, a member of a neighbouring american expedition, pete peterson, went missing and a british-american rescue party set out in the darkness
mr peterson was found hours later, wedged  feet down a crevasse and suffering from shock and exhaustion
""""we were very fortunate in finding the hole, which was the size of a manhole,"""" dr butson said during an interview """"we shone a light down and  we initially thought he must be dead, he can't possibly survive there was no sound coming from him
""""i volunteered to go down with the aid of ropes and the like to see how he was and then to our delight we found he was alive and not terribly badly injured but he was almost inextricably wedged into the crevasse, which gradually narrowed
""""it was extremely difficult to pry him out from his position and we were very fortunate that we were able to do it all the time the glacier was moving, there were ominous cracks and noises going on in order to get down to his level, i had to remove some of my clothing, my parka and a sweater i had to sort of duck-dive head down to get down to his level
""""i can't remember (what he said) but the strap of his haversack was around his neck throttling him, so he wanted that off i had to cut it off and that helped his breathing he'd been down there  hours or more then we managed to get his arms, they were in a straight position and that was hurting him, so i managed to free his arms to some extent and then get down to the level of his body and legs but that was extremely awkward as you might imagine in a very, very tight and confined area""""
mr peterson went on to become a major in the us marines, served in korea and is now a retired businessman in san francisco dr butson came to canada in  and spent many years with what became the canadian forces medical service
of the reunion, he said, """"over the period of time, we have come to know each other quite well, albeit every two years it's a very friendly occasion and a very significant occasion it's been a great privilege to meet the other men""""
ernie wooding, the other living canadian george cross winner, is extremely private about the night in october  when he pulled three other canadian navy sailors from the flaming engine room of a warship under construction in a shipyard on lake simcoe the ship exploded after some gasoline leaked into the bilge and the fumes ignited
""""there were four men in the engine room at the time,"""" mr wooding said during an interview from his home """"i got a couple of them out, they say three but, to be honest with you, i vividly remember two one got out on his own and that's about it: i climbed down into the engine room and hauled the guys out
""""let's face it, you don't think of (the danger) you're there and you just do things ninety per cent of people would have done the same thing faced with the same problem to be honest with you, i didn't figure i was all that much of a hero""""
for his action, he was to be awarded the albert medal, later converted to the george cross, by the then-governor general mr wooding was by then working in his native toronto as an electrician for what is now honeywell inc
""""four times the governor general tried to get me to go up to ottawa so he could present this albert medal to me and, as i say, i'm not for all that sort of nonsense i kept making excuses
""""then he came to toronto and i was invited to (a ceremony) and i said no, no i was too busy his aide called me about a week later and he said, `mr wooding we're having trouble getting this medal to you what are we going to do? i said, well, i don't like all that parade stuff, i just don't like being recognized, i'm not a public person'

when the medal was converted to the george cross in , """"they wanted me to send it back to them to get the george cross and i said no

today we start an occasional series looking at the tens of thousands of people who arrive in greater toronto each year
heritage classes hailed, a
watching blind date or the discovery channel offers valuable lessons on more than just the mating habits of humans and spiders
it is, carlos morales insists, a great way to pick up english
""""it's good when people talk, the bubble shows on their heads and you can read it,"""" morales says, referring to blind date """"it's also good for slang""""
with the precise analytical skills crucial to his profession as a mining engineer, -year-old morales, who arrived in toronto from colombia only two months ago, has discovered there are three kinds of english in north america: street english, newspaper and magazine english, and technical english
""""and i need to learn all three,"""" he says with a half-bitter smile
street english being crucial to getting around the city, he usually watches the discovery channel until the early hours of the morning, turning on the closed captions the single narrator used in many of the programs makes them easier to follow than sitcoms
""""at the same time the person is speaking, the closed caption is there all night i watch closed captions and listen to the person,"""" he says, leaning over pretending to watch a screen
""""i listen to the guy pronouncing the words as it is spelled on the television""""
listening, morales says, is the key to learning this language then watch people's mouths as they form the harsh, guttural english words that sound foreign to a spanish ear used to soft, rolling vowels
but it's difficult to pick up the language when most people speak quickly and in slang, he says
from punjabi to portuguese, serbian to spanish, the number of languages and dialects spoken by immigrants and refugees in toronto is mind-boggling
of the , newcomers who arrived here in - the last year for which figures are available- about , spoke neither english nor french
despite disparities in language, race and class, they face the same challenge: living the successful immigrant dream begins with learning english- and fast
as morales puts it, """"i feel like i was just born now""""
other newcomers to the city describe their lack of fluency as almost a physical barrier to starting a new life
when you can't speak the language, there is little incentive to leave your apartment, and that is isolating, says rocio alcantara, a -year-old nurse who arrived here from peru about seven months ago
one of the first things alcantara did when she got here was to sign up for a linc class, which is a federal government-funded program that teaches english as a second language, from basic beginner to relative fluency
instructor irene relph teaches level one to about  students who don't know a word of the language
""""it's survival english i teach them to say, 'what is your name? my name is   ' or 'open your book close your book,' """" relph says
by the end of the -month program, her students have learned enough to communicate their needs
""""they can ask for a coffee or complain about service in a restaurant, or they can go to the doctor and say, 'my back hurts,' """" she says
but as morales and alcantara attest, taking classes is never enough; you must also surrender yourself completely to this new and foreign culture- often to the point of popping a couple of aspirins to relieve the headache
the baffling slang alcantara hears on the subway- """"hey man, what's up?""""- isn't in her english textbooks
so she usually stays up until  am watching sitcoms, in addition to reading newspapers and tabloids to keep up with her more formal english studies
""""sometimes i feel i can't do it,"""" she says """"i need to learn more, faster, but i can't i want to meet people and read more and go to school, but what more can i do?""""
she practises her english on the subway by eavesdropping on conversations around her
""""people look at me, like why are you listening to what i am saying but i don't care about their business i want to know how they speak,"""" she says
it can be hard because people pepper the language heavily with """"do you know what i mean?"""" or """"um,"""" """"ah"""" and """"like""""
public transit is the sole mode of transportation for the vast majority of new immigrants who can't afford a car
but it's easy to get lost in this city, where all the neat, square intersections look alike, says milta verrera, who arrived here from argentina five months ago
the -year-old speaks a few words of english- hello, goodbye, how are you? do you have a job for me?- but it's barely enough to get around the city and certainly not enough to communicate that she is lost
when verrera can't find one of the bright white subway signs that are like beacons in the fast-paced city rushing around her, she stops and scans the crowds, looking for a spanish face
or she edges closer to groups of people, listening for the familiar spanish words
in a city like toronto, it's not too difficult to find people speaking spanish when she does, she grabs their arm and hurriedly explains
""""i grab them and say, 'oh thank-you!' """" verrera says, running her hand across her forehead in mock relief
stopping someone on the street, miming and gesturing your way toward an understanding, is much easier than using the telephone
morales is getting used to navigating the message system at citizenship and immigration canada
he says he often calls four or five times to understand what the taped voice is saying

Painting McGuinty as a puppet of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Eves warned yesterday that a Liberal government at Queen's Park would undermine the province's public safety and economic prosperity. """"The same people who have saddled Ontario with a broken immigration system that shuts the doors on literally tens of thousands of skilled workers yet seemingly welcomes criminals into our communities,"""" said Eves.","premier ernie eves admitted yesterday he does not know the price tag of his conservative party's election platform
eves was stumped when asked how much it will cost to implement the promises in """"the road ahead,"""" the election booklet first released in may
""""the exact price tag? i couldn't tell you off the top of my head,"""" the tory leader said yesterday during a campaign stop at a thornhill bag manufacturer
a senior tory official said afterward that the first-year cost of the platform is $ million - the five-year price tag has not been determined - but could not explain why eves did not know this
""""i don't know i think he was thinking about immigration,"""" the official said
eves had used the thornhill stop to suggest liberal leader dalton mcguinty will fling open ontario's doors to """"war criminals, would- be terrorists and other bad people"""" with his continued support of federal immigration policies
painting mcguinty as a puppet of prime minister jean chretien, eves warned yesterday that a liberal government at queen's park would undermine the province's public safety and economic prosperity
""""war criminals, would-be terrorists and other bad people get into canada because the federal liberals have created a system that seems to work for no one,"""" eves said at the factory staffed by new canadians
""""the same people who have saddled ontario with a broken immigration system that shuts the doors on literally tens of thousands of skilled workers yet seemingly welcomes criminals into our communities,"""" said eves
""""we simply can't afford to have dalton mcguinty's liberals defending the status quo and their friends in ottawa while we are risking the prosperity of this province and our security""""
at a hastily organized media scrum two hours later, eves returned to the issue of election platform costs
""""the (cost) is, in the first year, some $ million, which we think that we can easily accomplish by the  savings that we are outlining in our platform,"""" he said
eves said the limited mortgage-interest tax deductibility - worth $ a year for homeowners in the first year and capping at $ in  - will cost $ million in year one, but could eventually pay for itself
""""we don't believe that that will end up costing us a cent,"""" he said, adding tax cuts usually pay for themselves because people end up pumping the money they save back into the economy
last night in scarborough, mcguinty used his biggest crowd yet of the campaign to step up his attack on eves' lack of information about the cost of the platform
""""it seems to me that a fundamental test of leadership is to tell ontarians exactly what you're going to do, exactly how much it's going to cost and exactly where you're going to get the money,"""" eves told hundreds of cheering liberals
in thunder bay earlier yesterday, mcguinty said his promises amount to $ billion - money that the liberals say will come from cancelling planned corporate tax cuts, the tax credit for parents who choose to send their children to private school, cuts to government consultants and more aggressive collection of unpaid corporate taxes
""""we're the only party that's put out a four year plan that has been costed line by line and independently verified,"""" he said

""""it's an important economic issue and it's also an important public safety issue this is not an issue of race,"""" he said in thornhill
""""ontarians of every background are at risk when our borders are not secure""""
eves said he wants a """"made-for-ontario immigration system"""" similar to that enjoyed by quebec - complete with representatives abroad - so that the province would have a greater say in who comes here

marinos' first job, however, will be washing dishes at venetian sweets, a greek-owned restaurant and candy-making company where john also works
it is a pattern that has been followed by many who immigrate to canada -- by the chinese after they worked on the railway, by the greeks, macedonians, italians, vietnamese, indians, lebanese and jamaicans who have all settled here men and women unable to find jobs in their fields -- or facing years of retraining to meet canadian requirements, opt for a completely different way to make a living
moe attallah, who owns the world famous newport restaurant on richmond road, was an interior decorator in his native lebanon another lebanese in the restaurant business, samir matta, was an accountant; his first job in ottawa was washing dishes in a restaurant he moved up to short order cook and eventually co-owned a very popular restaurant in the westboro area
``my father and many of the greeks i know jumped from one career to a completely different one for which they had no special training when they came to north america,'' says bouris' daughter starr solomon, to whom he dictated a history of his early years before he died in 
``i think they saw a vacuum in this area of the service industry that wasn't being filled by those who had already settled in canada and since neither venture required much schooling, it was seen as a wonderful business opportunity and it was''
as each successive immigrant wave swept over ottawa, it left the city culturally richer and nowhere is that richness expressed better than in the wealth of ethnic restaurants, bakeries, pastry and pasta shops, butchers and delicatessens that now dot the area
but in the early years, says solomon, the restaurants owned by greeks often had chinese cooks and the food was strictly ``british-canadian fare'' -- fish and chips, hot chicken sandwiches, liver and onions, club sandwiches, rice pudding, apple pie a la mode and jell-o
one of six children born to vassilios bouris and eustathia nikilopoulos in rizes, greece, marinos was the last of three brothers who left greece to find a better life in canada a fourth brother, peter, eventually settled in australia like the ottawa bourises, peter and his five sons went into the food business
marinos, who would later be known as marvin in the city directory and then mike to his friends, wasn't overly impressed with his first glimpse of ottawa:
``it didn't look like a capital to me it looked too peaceful i saw smoked-blackened brick buildings on the main streets and plenty of blighted neighborhoods to indicate that any progress must have derived, not from the seat of government, but from some other source of commercial or industrial enterprise although i was disappointed with its general appearance, i was not personally discouraged
``i started work in the lowliest job -- washing dishes in one of two restaurants owned by peter and bill karson, brothers from rizes their original name was karkasiz but they'd changed it when peter had been refused a bank loan because of his foreign name''
mike bouris earned $ a week at venetian sweets,  sparks st after paying his share of the rent, he was able to save $ a week which he put into his ``new account at the bank of toronto there was plenty to eat at the restaurant''
but the property that really impressed him was karson's tea room,  rideau st, in the building where sante restaurant is now located
``there was nothing like the tea room; it was beautiful with both a winding staircase and an elevator leading to the second floor dining room the kitchen fronted on george street both restaurants specialized in handmade chocolates and hard candies in addition to serving full-course meals they were very profitable''
thanks to their employment and later business partnership with the karsons, the three bouris boys (mike, john and george) had gained enough experience by  to go into business for themselves a little short of capital, they were helped financially by their former employer, peter karson
the property they purchased had an interesting history and an intriguing owner
``my brother john heard that a small lucrative hotel, the bodega, at  york st in the byward market, was for sale -- cheap its owner, peter salter, was in his s and a familiar sight around town in his horse-drawn carriage, carnation in his lapel and a beautiful woman beside him''
mike admitted to starr that the bodega was never a prize hotel with distinguished guests
``after all,'' he said, ``the bodega was known as `the bucket of blood' market farmers and their families came to stay overnight and for light meals the tavern regulars were rowdy lumberjacks and lots of drunks who were handled by one particular waiter, lucien leblanc, aka moustache, who weighed at least  pounds
``why did we buy such a hotel? let me tell you, the beverage room was indeed a money-maker''
the bucket of blood the nickname has haunted me since i began researching this culinary history of ottawa i first came across it in sandra gwyn's book, the private capital noting his impressions of a rough and ready ottawa in , architect coly meredith referred to one of the most disreputable taverns on sparks street as ``the bucket of blood'' yet here was mike bouris giving the same nickname to the bodega hotel on york street
as well, the bodega hotel had popped up a couple of times during my research but i had always located it in what used to be called upper town rather than lower town and then there was peter salter, who seemed to float from one hotel to another
while i don't know how the bodega came to be called ``the bucket of blood,'' i do know that in coly meredith's early days as an architect in ottawa, there was a bodega complex at the corner of wellington and elgin streets, exactly where the war memorial now stands
house of ill repute
the complex consisted of the bodega hotel,  wellington, the bodega chambers,  wellington, and the bodega restaurant,  wellington the entire structure ran down the east side of elgin street, almost to sparks just across sparks street was the russell house hotel and tucked into the l formed by this famously elegant building was the popular russell theatre
the bodega hotel was a popular drinking spot and, most likely, a house of ill repute
at the turn of the century when the electric trams began running from downtown ottawa to britannia-by-the-bay, it was a favorite haunt of the military band members who gave concerts sunday afternoons at the west end park the band would gather at the bodega, have a few ``snorts'' and then board a special open-air streetcar and roll out to britannia, playing all the way
sometime in the early s, the bodega was purchased by peter salter no stranger to the hotel business, salter had owned at least two hotels in carleton place -- the queen's hotel in the late s and the leland hotel from  to 
in , the same year the russell hotel burned to the ground, the bodega hotel on wellington closed the land was expropriated by the federal government, on the urging of prime minister mackenzie king, who wanted a grand approach up elgin street to parliament hill the work was not undertaken until the late s
in , a new version of the bodega hotel opened in one of the byward market's oldest buildings peter salter, with his boutonniere and beautiful female companions, was at the helm
this was the hotel that the bouris brothers bought in , renaming it the chateau lafayette they hoped the name would appeal to the french-canadians of the byward market and act as a lure to american tourists
the laf, mike continued, ``had  rooms, each with its own sink at either end of the halls were a shower and toilet prostitutes plied their trade here with men who registered as john smith or with equally phoney french names we had long-term residents too, including my brother george and other greek bachelors'' peter salter, who for a while was night manager, lived at the hotel until his death
but mike never enjoyed dealing with the drunks at the laf
he cashed in his share of the venture in the s (his brother george continued on until the hotel was sold in ) in , he and john bought the connaught restaurant on elgin street facing the war memorial
they paid $, and spent $, renovating it newly married, mike's share came from his wife's dowry; his was a short-lived arranged marriage that was quite typical among greek families at the time
``i convinced john that it should be built of the very best materials and finish so that it would be trouble-free the exterior was grey quartz and sandstone with beautifully sculpted columns
``we hired the best architectural firm -- abra and richer, who were famous for the lord elgin hotel unlike the lafayette, we would start with a new, sparkling clean structure it was a brave -- and finally, distinguished venture and despite food rationing and belt tightening during the second world war, the connaught was a great financial success''
in fact, during the war, word of the connaught's generous portions of roast beef and roast chicken spread and line-ups around the block were a familiar sight
`decent' fare
``the connaught served decent canadian food at decent prices,'' says bill bouris, john's son ``coffee was five cents, toast and coffee a dime and a sirloin steak dinner cost  cents one of the busiest sections of the restaurant was the soda fountain where we made thousands and thousands of sundaes, sodas and milkshakes''
the connaught's chef was nick nickleson who later went on to open the very popular nickleson's town and country truck stop in pembroke in order to handle the demand for the connaught's famous cream pies, nick dorofi, the baker, would arrive at midnight and bake all night
``the cream pies were very rich,'' says bill, ``during the war, the quota for butter and eggs depended on a restaurant's volume we only had  seats but our volume was high so we always had butter and eggs left over -- and those went into the desserts''
mike was the first of the bourises to get out of the restaurant business, leaving the connaught in his brother john's capable hands mike became a farmer and, later, a real estate agent -- making a success of both ventures none of his seven children (by two wives) went into the restaurant business, although one of starr's sons currently works at one
when the chateau lafayette was sold, george bouris retired john bouris retired after selling the connaught in , but he held onto the building until the ncc expropriated it in the s
two of their children are still in the food business: john's son bill and george's son nick co-own the chances r restaurant at shoppers' city west -- a restaurant that serves generous portions of canadian-style chicken and rib dishes
but in another venture, bill has returned to his roots; he also owns the mykonos, a greek restaurant on merivale road

The 49-year-old from Simcoe, Ont., became Ontario's immigration minister in January. Two things. First, I would like to help us reach the point where all Ontarians see our diversity as one of our greatest strengths. And second, I want to make sure our newcomers have the same opportunities, no more, no less, as all Ontarians. Ultimately, I think that one of our greatest responsibilities is to make sure that Ontario's newcomers feel that they, and the enormous contributions they make to Ontario, are truly valued.

a practising family physician, rhodes scholar and co-founder of war child canada, hoskins won the provincial by-election in toronto's st paul's riding last year after an earlier defeat in the  federal election the -year-old from simcoe, ont, became ontario's immigration minister in january
the star caught up with him recently
whydidyou want to become a politician?
my work around the world, and as a doctor here in ontario, gave me a tremendous appreciation for the important role of government in creating peaceful, stable communities with strong health and social programs it also taught me about the importance of working locally to build strong, resilient societies i want to be able to contribute to that
what has been the toughest part about your transition to a politician?
my wife sam (also a doctor) and i seem to never be on the same schedule, which can make life complicated in my new role, i am often at events during the evenings and on weekends and she is also frequently on the road either for speaking engagements, or in the field, in war zones overseas we have a young son, and it can be quite challenging to balance it all
how has your experience as a doctor working in conflict zones helped you in your current role as immigration minister?
i've been lucky, over the years, to have been exposed to a diversity of communities within and outside of canada i have been to many of the countries that our new immigrants and refugees originate from in some cases, i've even seen first-hand some of the difficulties they may have experienced, whether these were the result of violence, poverty or insecurity
for many newcomers, it can be a very difficult road to get to canada and i believe that having witnessed some of what they were forced to endure has been the greatest preparation of all for my current role
who is your hero? why?
nelson mandela he overcame injustice to become one of the world's greatest leaders he was able to bring people together in an extraordinary way, and he helped people all over the world believe in their own capacity to make the world a better place and my wife, sam
tell us one thing you would like to change as immigration minister?
two things first, i would like to help us reach the point where all ontarians see our diversity as one of our greatest strengths and second, i want to make sure our newcomers have the same opportunities, no more, no less, as all ontarians ultimately, i think that one of our greatest responsibilities is to make sure that ontario's newcomers feel that they, and the enormous contributions they make to ontario, are truly valued

the montreal canadiens captain's lack of spoken french has cropped up occasionally as an issue over the past few seasons
this week, it was quebec city lawyer guy bertrand who spoke out about it in front of a provincial commission studying the so-called reasonable accommodation of minorities and immigrants
parti quebecois leader pauline marois went one step further by affirming the canadiens should insist on french courses for its players
the canadiens' finnish-born captain knew what was waiting for him when he saw the horde of journalists surrounding his locker following practice yesterday

degree honoris causa - """"for the sake of honour'' - is the formal description of doctorates invested by universities on an often eclectic assortment of recipients, a practice dating back to the middle ages in england
william shatner was thus recognized by mcgill in montreal, the octogenarian's hometown, in june his advice to students: """"don't be afraid of making an ass of yourself i do it all the time and look what i got""""
one needn't actually have attended the school doing the awarding, merely approved for investiture by internal committees, perhaps for lifetime achievements sometimes candidates seem to have been chosen simply for their celebrity or a local connection, an exercise in quid pro quo (see, i can talk latin, too) that draws a whiff of associated panache
those so recognized run the gamut from samuel johnson (dropped out of oxford because of financial hardship) to hunter s thompson and stephen colbert they have the right to call themselves doctor - some insist on it - though scholastic honourifics are not used in, say, the star
dolly parton got hers from the university of tennessee the tyrant robert mugabe was inexplicably deemed worthy by the university of massachusetts, jack nicholson from brown, and mike tyson from central state university in ohio even kermit the frog copped one from southampton college this year, harvard settled a doctorate of music on placido domingo
so, merit is a fluid principle
why not, then, don cherry?
at least the provocative tv personality and former nhl coach has bona fides as staunch supporter of the canadian military, a true friend to soldiers and sailors and airmen (and airwomen, lest anyone accuse me of being sexist) it was the royal military college (rmc) that had voted to grant homeboy cherry an honorary doctorate, surely a tickling distinction for someone who sounds like he dropped out of school in grade 
but cherry, as he confirmed on hockey night in canada over the weekend, has decided to decline the honour, citing concern that the convocation ceremony would turn into a three-ring circus should it proceed, deflecting attention from the two other individuals selected by the rmc
i'm not a cherry fan, or un-fan for that matter but i do know that he's beloved by troops, visited them in afghanistan, has significant ties to the college - his mother worked there - and can boast a grandfather who enlisted with the canadian expeditionary forces, wounded at vimy ridge in  he is, undoubtedly, a patriot
that should have been good enough and, indeed, still is despite the exaggerated objections of one () faculty member
french professor catherine lord criticized the decision to honour cherry in an open letter to the local newspaper as well as other media outlets
wrote lord: """"on many occasions, he publicly expressed his contempt for many groups of the canadian population, notably for the french-speaking canadians, for the (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered) community and for the immigrants""""
a devotee of coach's corner i am not but i'm fairly sure that, if cherry had waxed bumptious about gays, transgendered, etc, or immigrants, i would have heard or read about it somebody's connecting dots that simply aren't there
and, while cherry has certainly been less than flattering about some francophone and foreign hockey players - ridiculing the former for wearing face shields and the latter for their alleged soft, euro-style - these allegations, however narrow-minded, relate to narrow observations about the game, views shared by a whole lot of north american fans
if cherry's opinions are so radical and objectionable, then he shouldn't be provided a platform on the cbc, the quantifiably left-leaning national broadcaster but cherry is nearly as much of a draw as hockey itself, clearly the network turns itself inside-out justifying his continuing bully platform
cherry is catnip for a coterie of usual suspects who can't abide free speech imperatives, a constituency overly represented on college campuses
if unconventional thinking can't be tolerated in our universities, then where?
i detest the apartheid week nonsense that annually contaminates campuses with anti-semitism, but i would never condone shutting them up or withholding tributes for their chosen demagogues
to its credit, rmc has brushed off lord's whinge (which purportedly is shared by some other faculty members)
lord is entitled to her opinion, as further stated: """"rmc is increasingly representative of the diverse society in which we live rmc is a strong and unifying place; it makes canadians proud and attracts year after year dynamic and intelligent young adults these students certainly feel canadians (sic) first, regardless of their spiritual beliefs, their political allegiance, their sexual orientation, their mother tongue or their cultural background""""
well, bully for rmc but none of that is remotely undermined by giving cherry a doctorate go ahead, ask some of those students so who's really being the bigoted, illiberal harpy here?

2386777911,Canada must release all refugees,Aucun(e) disponible.,"crossing borders seeking refuge from danger is not a crime, but people who do so are often treated like suspects and thrown into detention centres and then, because those centres are overflowing, into prison
three weeks after canada embarked on a nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of covid-, people fleeing brutality, persecution or other challenging conditions in their home countries and heading to canada find themselves being punished with another kind of violence wrought by indifference
indifference, but not inaction
on the contrary, canadian policies are taking people at the most unstable moments in their lives and putting them in harm's way - by turning some back to the us, where they are trapped between the cruelty of ice (immigration and customs enforcement) and the virulence of covid- and by exposing others to a catastrophic risk cooped up in canadian cells, excluded from its public health measures including social distancing
given the exacerbating situation around the pandemic,  detainees at quebec's laval immigration monitoring centre went on a hunger strike recently
""""we have a tv we could follow the news every day and knew what was going on,"""" said abdoul, who had been detained at laval since january when his asylum was denied abdoul is not his real name he sought anonymity for fear of repercussions
""""they were very much being kept in the dark the ability to self-isolate was a privilege not afforded to migrant detainees or any incarcerated people,"""" said robyn maynard, an author, activist and educator
abdoul says they began to worry once they started hearing about the virus's spread in canada
""""that pushed us to ask them to do something we knew how it's affecting so many people we talked to one another""""
meanwhile, at least one guard at the toronto immigration holding centre tested positive for covid-
""""at first, they (the authorities) told us newcomers from (the) airport would go to medical screening we found out that wasn't true people from (the) airport said they never went to (a) medical checkup
""""we told them, 'we know you're telling us lies we know (the) general population can be carriers of (the) virus'""""
the detainees wrote a petition in french and abdoul went around collecting signatures """"we noted the guards came in and out every day we see every day in the news new cases, a lot of people getting contaminated
""""we said 'let us go out, so we could be safe'""""
with help from solidarity without borders, the detainees released a handwritten petition to the media on march , but it made no difference to their plight despite a clear statement by human rights and refugee rights groups, including at the united nations and the world health organization, that: """"considering the lethal consequences a covid- outbreak would have, they (detained migrants) should be released without delay,"""" canada was yet to feel any urgency
that's when the laval detainees went on a hunger strike, refusing all three daily meals that were offered by this time, abdoul became a de facto spokesperson for the fasting strikers the guards told him, """"it's pretty much a waste of time it's happened before""""
abdoul responded, telling the guards, we weren't breaking any rules and we wanted to do this """"they said, 'yes, but it's not going to do nothing'""""
toward the end of march, the strikers began to get some high-profile support including from british columbia liberties association, indigiqueer and trans writers, and prisoners in nova scotia's burnside prison writer leanne betasamosake simpson and academic glen coulthard wrote open letters to minister of public safety bill blair in support of the strikers
the canada border services agency began releasing detainees within days by april , the three immigration centres around canada held  people, down from  on march , the agency told media but thousands of immigration detainees remain in canadian prisons, some indefinitely, where they don't have access to quality health care
in laval, there are approximately  people still being held, including women and those in isolation, down from  on april , maynard said
the border agency is """"not giving the policy or logic behind those choices,"""" she said """"they're still leaving people in the dark because there is no clear policy on the risks around covid- and what they're going to be doing with detainees
""""they're treating a certain section of the population as more disposable""""
abdoul was released april  his sister is a student and she has a child she managed to cobble together $ for a bond for his release
he is now undergoing a -day mandatory isolation period in her house he does not have the right to work (or study), which means his sister now has another mouth to feed
""""i feel worried about my case i'm still fighting for it i'm worried about my friends that are left i want people to do something for them we heard jails have cases of contamination we know they're not safe there,"""" abdoul said
for god's sake, canada, unless they are known criminals, release them all offer safe housing to those who may not have families make them eligible to receive the emergency response benefit and, since they are here, allow them to become productive members of society
surely we have enough space, resources - and humanity - to do it all

the debate surrounding ghettoes - on the one hand, centres of power for groups that would otherwise be marginalized; on the other, neighbourhoods where isolation becomes pathological - heated up after this week's approval by the toronto district school board of a black-focused school
some in the black community - like some in the gay community - just want a place where outside forces cannot negatively impact on a beleaguered group the fear is that those areas become so self-sufficient, interaction beyond them is deemed undesirable or, worse, unnecessary
for anyone familiar with our city's dominant ethnic communities, chinese and south asian, and the suburbs where they have concentrated, markham and brampton respectively, microsoft's toronto dilemma comes as no surprise
almost a quarter of brampton's , residents describe themselves as south asian and neighbourhoods such as springdale (aka singhdale) are almost exclusively punjabi it's no surprise the city is seen by many as the worst example of a fractured cultural mosaic

instead of toiling at low-wage factory jobs or driving a cab to get by, many south asians in brampton, mostly immigrants, have quickly developed small- and medium-scale businesses to take advantage of their exploding consumer base strip malls throughout the city are dominated by punjabi signs
politically, on the provincial and federal levels, punjabi canadians now hold the majority of brampton's seats these growing spheres of political and economic influence would never have emerged if the negative image of a south asian ghetto had kept immigrants awaya similar economic dynamic has unfolded in markham, where chinese canadian entrepreneurs like jack tsui have forged a partnership with the city that's transforming the toronto suburb into an international success story

and with the clout of almost , unofficial chinese canadian ambassadors living in markham, memorandums of agreement to do more business with booming chinese cities such as beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, hong kong and wuhan have recently been signed
the economic and social capital being built by chinese canadians would be impossible if not for the tight knit so-called ghetto they have voluntarily created

some of the extras are unavoidable, such as almost $ million in additional debt servicing -- most of it to pay for the new city hall and an estimated $-million drop in interest income on deposits, thanks to falling interest rates

where should ottawa look to save millions of dollars?
below is a sampling of some groups and programs out of hundreds that received city money in , along with an outline of what each does, how many are employed, and what effect a city budget cut would have on the operation as any councillor willtell you, the choices aren't easy see for yourself:
) ottawa school of art,  george st
 city funding: $,
total budget for fiscal -: $,
employees: eight full-time, four part-time,  instructors on contract
program: full range of art courses, age four to adult
incorporated in  as the municipal arts centre, the school gets money from the city, regional government, the ministry of culture and communications and the ontario arts council
""""city funding is absolutely critical,"""" says executive director jeff stellick """"if we lost that money we wouldn't be able to provide the same number of courses we just wouldn't have the staff to keep the building running""""
) garbage pickup
 city cost: $ million
is ottawa so chintzy that it can't pick up garbage each week? that what capital coun jim watson asks, as senior bureaucrats have proposed reducing winter trash collection to once every two weeks, and blue box recycling to biweekly pickups allyear garden waste pickup and used clothing recycling may also be abandoned
potential savings could be $,, although staff haven't made detailed calculations before any cuts are made, the city must re-open its existing collection contract with laidlaw waste management inc the contract doesn't expire until may ,
) city travel budget
 city cost: $,
the city travel budget includes $, for staff and politicians to attend conventions, and $, for travel on city business travel became a handy target during council most recent budget debate, when spending was reduced from $, in the travel budget covers trips to toronto, for example, to lobby government officials, and conventions on issues relevant to city business gone are the jet-setting days of the s when former mayor jim durrell went thither and yon asj

the largest public and social housing agency in ottawa-carleton, city living gets most of its money from provincial and federal subsidies income from rents pay for almost half the operation, yet the city annual contribution of $, subsidizesrent for about  tenants with lowest incomes
eliminating the direct city subsidy would have a """"drastic impact on tenants,"""" says yeeseng lee, director of finance and systems """"some of them would have a -per-cent increase in rent"""" for example, a low-income family paying, say, $a month might suddenly have to pay $

no need to worry about that in this country we pay homage to squeegee kids and their hard-luck stories we worship at the twin altars of victimization and deprivation and that leaves precious little time for individuals whose brains, guts and sweat help them overcome great hurdles
jasmin mulaosmanovic is , but you'd think twice about calling him a teenager he has the maturity level, forged through adversity, of someone twice that age

i happen to love wild geese, most of the time i grew up in toronto, a gooseless place, apart from the harbour, where a colony of the birds prefer the foul water and fast life of the city to the pristeen wilderness of hudson bay
in ottawa each fall you see them on their flyway, just west of the citizen building near greenbank road, or flying over the queensway west of bayshore around sunset you can pick out one vee after another against the bright western sky, always flying north it puzzles some people (north in the fall?) until they realize the geese are just returning to the river for the night during the day, they waddle around farm fields in the region, foraging on corn stubble ottawa is their staging area on the flight south, a place to rest, eat and regain energy after weeks of hard flying from the north
they do the same thing at this time of the year on their return flight north, but most pass east of the city where they can rest in flooded fields around such areas as bear brook or along the south nation river
earlier in the spring they arrive along the st lawrence river near such communities as prescott and morrisburg, they take advantage of the fast current and open water to wait for the north smaller lakes and rivers to melt geese follow the spring melt, flying only as far north as they can find open water and food
but these are migratory geese on their way to hudson bay there another side to the canada goose story -- the thousands that have adopted warmer parts of southern and eastern ontario, and nearby american states, as their year-round homes -- inviting habitats where lawns are rich and delicious and the water stays open and almost no one hunts them
the giant canada goose was hunted almost to extinction in the mid- th century but it was rediscovered in , and biologists made a concerted effort in canada and the us to rebuild its numbers, restricting hunting and setting up new goose colonies
it worked -- too well, in some places
""""once they're gone, it takes them a long time to come back,"""" says ken ross of the canadian wildlife service """"it wasn't until the s that they really started to move (increase), and then the numbers went exponentially and they're still rising""""
southern ontario resident canada goose population is , to , geese, all living south of north bay their numbers have stabilized in southwestern ontario but are still rising in the eastern part of the province ross will survey them next year; there are certainly thousands in eastern ontario, and perhaps more than ,
there are three other main flyways, or migration paths: along the mississippi river, the """"central"""" flyway west of that, and the pacific the atlantic flyway migrants travel between northern quebec or northern ontario and the maryland area there were , breeding pairs in the latest count, roughly half of which pass through the ottawa valley those , pairs can translate into , to , birds heading south in the fall but that in a good breeding year hunting can also change population numbers dramatically
research at the city university of new york shows the population of geese in the atlantic flyway (which includes eastern ontario) is expanding at a rate of  per cent a year there were one million canada geese in north america in ; the canadian wildlife service says there may be five million today
""""there will be thousands in eastern ontario now -- resting and refuelling, eating everything in sight,"""" says ross """"the next jump is a long one, because there really aren't any resources for them until they get to the breeding grounds""""
geese arrive in the ottawa region in mid-march and stay into mid- may
""""there no point in going any earlier, because you arrive up in the arctic and northern quebec in a big pile of snow it not going to do them much good""""
while quintessentially canadian, resident geese have made enemies whole web sites are dedicated to ridding golf courses and private property of the """"nuisance"""" birds some irate land owners oil the goose eggs to suffocate embryos; some destroy nests; some hunt adult birds; some scare them with noisemakers and not without justification, they say the birds' prodigious rate of droppings -- up to  tablespoon-sized lumps a day each loaded with tens of thousands of coliform bacteria -- raise real health concerns
""""it has been purported (by farmers) that three geese are the equivalent of one cow for pollution,"""" says ottawa naturalist dan brunton
yes, they do leave a lot of visible droppings, he says, """"but that nothing that no big deal there no way the goose manure management problem is up there with cows can you imagine? if that were true, the ottawa river, the jock, the carp would be absolutely sterile, with the number of geese they have""""
but the geese can change the nature of the landscape, or the waterscape, brunton says they're aggressive, tough and territorial two or three pairs nest each year at mud lake in west-end ottawa, driving away nesting ducks
""""the problem is not geese the problem is too many geese in places not designed to handle large numbers,"""" brunton says """"another concern is that because of our mild winters we have a lot of open water and a lot of waterfowl wintering and a lot of those are geese they're going to be huge vectors of disease  one of these days someone going to find  dying mallards at their regular feeding spot,"""" victims of overcrowding among urban birds drawn to people feeding them
as well, the geese we see in summer are not native they were helped here by biologists trying to build new colonies for them; they should be flying to the north, not hanging around ottawa begging for handouts
migrant geese are the true natives and up to , can congregate east of ottawa toward bourget, the clay flats floodplain of the ancient champlain sea
""""to see and hear several thousand geese go up at one time is really impressive, like these african spectacles with thousands of animals running across the plain,"""" brunton says
""""they are a very efficient bird,"""" says canadian wildlife service ken ross """"they sit around and they look miserable and everybody thinks they're on death door well, they're not they've got adequate insulation, and unless it really, cold they'll hang in""""
but they will be driven south if snow covers the grass and farm stubble they eat food is key; in late fall and early spring the geese need to eat a lot to produce heat -- particularly the corn stubble left after harvest in this region farm fields, and in spring they feast on shoots of plants they love golf courses with fertilized grass they eat more on land than in water; they retreat to water mostly for protection
""""they'll just hunker down in groups they'll get some benefit there, the outside ones warming the inner ones, just like penguins do and they'll move around a little bit so that you're not always on the outside""""
as well, the cells in birds' legs and feet don't suffer the same tissue damage (frostbite) that humans' cells do when they get cold those skinny goose legs can spend hours in icy water what matters is keeping the blood supply warm as it passes through the exposed legs, and the geese have evolved an odd circulatory system in which blood entering the legs from above warms the blood returning from the legs, re-circulating the heat as much as possible
note to boss: thanks for trip to cornwall!
note to self: must find fascinating bird that lives in aruba
there are probably more than  types of canada geese that vary in size and appearance, from the tiny cackling goose of the west coast ( kilograms) to the eight-kilogram """"giant race"""" to which our resident geese belong
canada geese nest in watery places where both parents can defend the nest and raise the young the muskeg, a vast waterlogged plain surrounding hudson bay, is the favoured summer home for the geese that migrate through ottawa geese seek out the most watery places there, nesting on small islands near the water edge
the family of two stay-at-home parents and four to five goslings is a tight-knit unit that swims and walks together goslings can't fly in the early weeks, and neither can the parent birds which are grounded for three to four weeks in the north when they lose their flight feathers by early august the entire family is in the air, and the birds start putting on fat to prepare for the fall migration
if ducks are the quick little fighter aircraft in the world of waterfowl, geese are the heavy cargo planes with a top speed of about  knots -- about half as fast as ducks
because of their weight, they are barely able to get aloft once in the air, they rely on a balance between their long neck and their wings, placed far back on their bodies
goose wings have a large """"moment,"""" explains engineering professor brian thompson of the university of western ontario that engineering talk for a force that tries to push the front edge of its wing up and let the trailing edge drop the birds' long neck counterbalances this rotational push
hawks, eagles and other gliding birds have more efficient wings
""""geese are not efficient flyers at all they do an incredible amount of work to fly compared to other animals,"""" thompson says """"they're big and powerful, but they're heavy"""" and it this low ratio of strength to weight that makes them relatively poor flyers, like an aircraft with a low thrust-to-weight ratio the birds' awkward physique is also responsible for the vee-shaped formation they adopt when flying the formation takes advantage of a """"tip vortex"""" -- the swirling body of air left by each beating wingtip if a bird follows in another goose vortex, it benefits from a bit of lift
canada geese can make bird lovers, like bruce di labio, uneasy he began birding in the s and it is his life but when asked: """"what do you think of geese?"""" he pauses and answers: """"it like a loaded question
""""they used to be more of a sign of spring now they stay as late as possible and show up extremely early  and in certain aspects they're on the verge of becoming a nuisance
""""down south of here you hear the americans say, 'oh, your canadian geese are eating up our golf courses and making a mess of everything' i like seeing canada geese when i'm up north, away from civilization they're a beautiful sight and they're wonderful to hear but now they're summer residents they don't just leave""""

People stick pins in a map to show where they're from. The city is home to people from 112 countries. Two gold mines that were the mainstay of Yellowknife's economy for decades are closed. Now, two diamond mines about 300 kilometres northeast of the city help drive the economy, although many of the miners live in the south.

they're in the mine rescue competition it's always a highlight at the picnic, held each june to honour the industry that launched yellowknife
in the past, teams from two gold mines dominated the competition, as the mines ruled the city now, the serious, squinting men are from bhp-billiton ltd, diavik diamond mines inc, and de beers canada
the first two companies operate mines in the remote barren lands, about  kilometres northeast of here the third is to start production there in a couple of years
near the map, hot dogs and hamburgers blacken on three industrial- scale barbecues determinedly jolly corporate types dish them to the crowd of about  the cooks' t-shirts sport the names of the diamond companies each runs its own grill
the gold mines - which through various corporate owners were always called con and giant - are defunct all that remains are costly cleanups of deadly arsenic
yellowknife now proclaims itself """"the diamond capital of north america""""
over on the sidewalk, gord, a recovering crack-cocaine addict, watches with a mix of bemusement and anger as a grey-faced man known as friar relaxes in the shade, enjoying the free lunch
police say friar is active in the recently established and flourishing crack trade dealers openly sell the drug on a bleak downtown block, a -minute stroll from the picnic site
yellowknife is an unlikely place
european explorers coined the name for the copper blades used by local indians encountered in the early s but the city exists because of gold
its history is short while prospectors spotted the precious metal about  years ago, mine development began only in the mid- s giant didn't pour its first gold brick until 
in the 's, a ragged settlement spread over sandy flats and a rocky peninsula on yellowknife bay, near the north end of great slave lake known as """"old town,"""" it was a haphazard collection of shack homes, warehouses, stores, bush plane bases and government offices
a decade later, the federal government built """"new town,"""" up a long hill from the """"big lake,"""" with straight streets and modern amenities
the small downtown centres on the intersection of th ave and th st - two banks, a drug store, and a parking lot where part of a hotel was demolished several years ago after snow buckled the roof
the avenue is the city's main spine it starts in old town, climbs up the hill to the business core, then runs out to the new suburbs
the core is a dull collection of restaurants, bars and independent stores, the post office, a hotel and mall, and small office blocks more of the same, some taller buildings and simple homes - mostly aging bungalows and wood-frame walk-ups - line a handful of side streets
the nadir is th st, the crack-track, with the gold range hotel - a decaying former social hub - at one end and the right spot - an ugly bunker of a sports bar whose front doorway and back lane shelter dealers and buyers - at the other
the suburbs, where mobile homes fetch $, or more, feature barren streets, big-box stores and fast-food plazas everywhere, sites with views are crammed with overwrought designs, often on tall stilts
industrial warehouses, including three of the barbed-wire- enclosed diamond-cutting plants, surround the airport
beauty was left to the natural landscape, which offers it in spades
the old yellowknife could be rowdy, and was home to a few colourful bush pilots and prospectors unlike the boom-and-bust yukon, though, it inspired no larger-than-life legends in fact, it became rather staid a middle-class frontier
here, gold was corporate con and giant - both within the town borders - became steady employers hardworking miners went home to family bungalows after each shift and picked up decent weekly paycheques
the city's role as the territory's administrative centre required office-loads of civil servants
the result a prosperous, informal, close-knit place at the end of  kilometres of gravel road, with far more amenities than a community of fewer than , had any right to expect
as in small towns everywhere, anyone here more than a few months claimed to know almost everyone else, and picking up mail at the only post office was a cherished social occasion the city was minutes from boundless wilderness; bush planes droned constantly; and old town remained a lively, unruly link with the past yet, as head of a territory that, until , covered one-third of canada, the city felt a bit sophisticated, too
the main blight was a quiet racism that relegated most indians to three impoverished, alcohol-ravaged settlements nearby
in the mid-s, a group of oil companies proposed a pipeline to carry natural gas from arctic wells, up the mackenzie valley to markets in southern canada and the us the federal government appointed mr justice thomas berger to conduct an inquiry into the project's social and environmental impacts
aboriginal groups strongly opposed the project and berger, after hearings in dozens of tiny communities, recommended a delay of at least  years ottawa agreed that success encouraged the groups to demand land claims and political power
but for yellowknife, it began a series of setbacks
the gold mines went into a slow death spiral con closed in ; giant, a year later
in , the eastern northwest territories was lopped off to become nunavut, taking hundreds of government jobs
after the terrorist attacks on new york, the number of japanese tourists who came each year to view the northern lights dropped from , to ,
but the city had actually hit bottom in , when an angry union member murdered nine replacement workers and scabs during a bitter strike at giant that event not only hastened the mine's demise, but was also a social watershed, says david harder, who runs crackbusters, a program offered at the salvation army for recovering addicts
""""there was a shift it became less close and trusting,"""" he says
while the old underpinnings continued to weaken, foundations for the new yellowknife were being laid
reports of diamonds set off a claims rush the city buzzed as the first mines were approved and built then, the mackenzie valley pipeline was revived at $ billion, it would be canada's biggest private-sector project it seems destined to go ahead, since most aboriginal groups now back it
so, yellowknife is growing fast, and is facing big-city issues its population doubled to , - nearly half the territory's total - in the past  years and the city plan accommodates ,
the unemployment rate is only  per cent - well below the national average - and the average family income is a lofty $,
""""related to the size of the city and the market, there are huge pressures,"""" says bill braden, a member of the territorial legislature for a yellowknife riding """"the city and builders are trying to keep up""""
the easygoing town of a few years ago is no more, he says """"it has an edge to it""""
""""our small, nice, cute town is not that any more,"""" says karen hoeft, who has headed the salvation army in yellowknife since  and ran the memorial service for the slain giant miners - an event few attended
in the """"old"""" days, it was common to see drunks urinating on the street, or passed out but alcohol was understandable and not a direct threat to the sober
crack introduced a criminal element the city is more violent - its first drug-related murder trial took place in june
on the other hand, the place is still so small that its problems are in your face, hoeft says
""""you can't miss it the strange thing about yellowknife is that it's global, and cosmopolitan, but it's also at the end of the road so, you can't run away from it""""
teachers see more families in crisis, says merril dean, the principal at weledeh elementary school spouse abuse is on the rise
some blame the mineworkers' schedule they work two weeks straight of -hour days, away from their families, then go home for two weeks
an estimated  to  young teens are lost, dean says
""""they should be in school but are not they're not registered they don't exist they fly beneath the radar they hang out in the malls or outside the gold range""""
there's a growing gap between rich and poor people associated with the mines and government make good money, including northern premiums
but yellowknife is also now home to a wal-mart and other chains that pay much less, with no subsidies
""""how do you manage to rent an apartment at $, a month on $ an hour?"""" dean wonders """"it's tough to live here on $ an hour""""
yellowknife has a food bank, and weledeh feeds lunch to up to  kids each month
""""that may not seem like a lot in downtown toronto,"""" dean says """"but this is a community with allegedly the highest per capita income in canada""""
in , the salvation army housed  men and women each night now, there are usually  and  families are waiting for shelter
""""yellowknife has lost its innocence,"""" harder says
well, not quite
for nearly three years, jen walden has lived in old town, in one of the few shacks remaining from yellowknife's early days
the ontario native and her mostly young neighbours get by on wood heat and without running water and flush toilets
the other evening, she says, she came home to find fresh fish fillets in her fridge another shack dweller had dropped them off
that's the lifestyle, says walden, a -year-old artist and musician
""""i love it i know that at any time you can come home here and find a pot of soup on your doorstep, your fire lit and your dog fed""""
the shacks won't survive much longer the vestiges might be rendered into a historic park, if enough money can be found
the diamond mines are far bigger than the funky little gold mines were, and they operate on a global scale still, they bring less to yellowknife
con and giant paid municipal taxes, says peter neugebauer, the city's development director the new mines are far beyond the city limits ottawa gets its taxes and royalties and gives back little to either the territorial government or yellowknife
gold miners lived and spent their wages in the city
those in the diamond industry can earn a good living but while the mine managers and administrators live in yellowknife, many of their truck drivers, loader operators and other blue-collar workers stay in the south
many were expected to move here but that didn't happen the two- week breaks made it worth the long trip south, and yellowknife's housing costs were a deterrent
""""a lot of money flies over yellowknife,"""" neugebauer says
aboriginal communities negotiated compensation agreements with diavik and bhp the terms are secret but the results - new facilities, services and indian-run businesses - are obvious yellowknife didn't try for such a deal, neugebauer says
but it should have insisted the mines build affordable housing for their workers or provide other benefits, he says the federal government should have bargained harder for better royalties or a bigger share of diamond processing
most of yellowknife's new jobs are in industries that support the mines, things like transportation, cleaning and maintenance, security, food services and computers
beyond tourism, there are few alternatives, neugebauer says yellowknife is too far from markets for manufacturing
and it faces an issue shared by no other canadian capital
on aug , the dogrib indians who live in four villages in a large territory north of yellowknife, will launch canada's first aboriginal self-government the yellowknives, whose traditional area encircles the capital and includes part of it, are negotiating similar land claim and government agreements
that's caused conflict over opening land for housing and other projects, and leads some to fear the city is being hemmed in but the results could be positive, for development and race relations, says mayor gordon van tighem both sides seem willing to work together
and since land claims and compensation agreements are designed to keep money in the north, businesspeople are coming to appreciate them
marie cotte recalls the day in december  when she and her three children arrived from mauritius, a tropical island off africa's east coast her husband, louis, had made the journey six months earlier
""""i was happy to see him, but after a few months i thought 'it's not for me here,'"""" she says as she fries beef and onions in the family's spartan third-floor apartment, four blocks from the main corner
thousands here can relate to her story
""""when we came, we knew nobody,"""" she says """"but everyone is nice to you you feel welcome the people are nice, but not the weather""""
when she and the children left mauritius, the temperature was c five aircraft later, they were in minus- and seeing snow for the first time
louis was recruited for a three-year contract at a diamond polishing plant, the same kind of work he'd done for  years
they thought they were coming to """"a big city like new york,"""" marie says, laughing
a dozen other mauritius families have come to yellowknife they meet regularly to talk and prepare dishes from home they can get, approximately, the food they want, but """"the taste is not the same,"""" marie says
that's not exactly hardship, and there's plenty of support
several groups offer get-togethers for immigrant families or women and organize winter clothing drives schools welcome newcomer parents, offer language training in english, french and dogrib, and operate after-class programs to help kids integrate
in summer, the cottes play sports, bike or hike and swim at one of the parks on two small lakes within the city boundaries if they choose, they could enjoy outdoor patios at a couple of restaurants but the cold weather - which lasts from early october to late march - takes a toll apart from going to school, work or shopping, they hibernate
that contributes to yellowknife's biggest challenge it remains a place of transients
amrik kanwal was a mine electrician in zambia but drove taxi here when his kids were grown, he took courses at the local community college that led him to computer refurbishing he expects to retire to calgary his son, a student at the university of lethbridge, is already in the south to stay
marie and louis cotte aim to return to their warm island
at the other end of the scale, the cotte kids like it here they have good friends and love weledeh school they say they'd like to stay
but people are starting to put down roots

near the top of the hour-long show at the senator cabaret, the unnamed character played by mantas wants to impress us with how unaltered his greek parents have been by  years of living in canada
""""take my mother,"""" he says """" please"""" when it obvious the audience doesn't quite know how to respond, he moans with exasperation, """"thank you, henny youngman""""
well, what did you expect? what is the point of even using that line, except maybe to quickly assert the jokey, superficiality of what will follow?
the through-line in the narrative concerns the pressure being put on the character into marrying an eligible, young, greek-canadian crack addict, if only for the sake of heterosexual appearances this is intended to underscore how unaccepting of homosexuality is your average greek-canadian family
but the play affords no original insights into this predictable antipathy it trades, instead, on a running gag that involves the parents threatening to have a heart attack at the utterance of unwanted news
along the way, ayanoglu get off a few digs particularly provocative is the frustrated character suspicion that multi- culturalism is a """"wasp trick"""" because it discourages assimilation
and mantas, without much depth of characterization to work with, is fairly adept at employing a familiar array of stand-up comedy tics, including punctuating pauses and knowing facial expressions, to push across the humorous side of the material
but this isn't nearly enough what needed are more jokes to keep the material aloft or more substance to make the pauses between the punchlines more purposeful

1551807588,Better bridge over health-care language gap,"The service is available 24-7 at participating organizations. Because the University Health Network buys in bulk, the cost per agency is much lower than it otherwise would be. [...]according the Centre for Inner City Health, they believe the quality of the care is better when they can communicate without fear of being misinterpreted by their health-care provider.","  downtown toronto is the most linguistically diverse piece of geography in the country the city's manager says more than  languages are spoken within the municipality's borders the provincial health authority for the district south of eglinton ave (toronto central local health integration network, or lhin, to use its formal name) serves clients in  languages
it sounds like an urban tower of babel - and would be but for the efforts of educators, immigrant settlement organizations, social service agencies and friends and family of newcomers
but there is one field where this ad hoc system falls short of the mark: health care
medical professionals, nursing home staff, mental health counsellors and home-care workers need to understand with as much as precision as possible what kind of help an individual needs
six years ago, the toronto central lhin recognized that health-care agencies under its jurisdiction couldn't deliver high-quality, equitable care without tackling this problem so it joined forces with sick kids hospital to devise a plan of action it called for professional interpreters in october , the lhin set up a centralized language services hub, offering professional interpreters to all its members they were under no obligation to use it, but most signed up
the initial feedback has been positive, but mostly anecdotal the lhin wanted an outside evaluation before expanding the initiative it asked the research unit and the centre for research on inner city health to assess what was working, what was missing and what needed adjustments
its report is now in the key findings are that the program has greatly improved accessibility to health services for patients with little or no english; the majority of users - both patients and health-care providers - are satisfied with the service; and it could improve with a few changes and supplements
""""our findings underline the importance of providing patients with easy access to professionally trained interpreters,"""" said tatiana dowbor, manager of the survey research unit """"they also offer some important insights into opportunities for program expansion and the need for additional forms of interpretation""""
the structure of the program is bewilderingly complex the toronto central lhin is the """"executive sponsor"""" the university health network is the program manager it draws up contracts with other health-care organizations seeking to use the service the actual interpretation is provided by the remote interpretation ontario on a fee-for-service basis a variety of technological tools are used by health-care providers: dual handset phones, speakerphones, teleconferencing (the patient normally needs only a basic telephone with extra jacks)
from a user's perspective, however, the pieces mesh the service is available - at participating organizations because the university health network buys in bulk, the cost per agency is much lower than it otherwise would be
patients using the service no longer have to bring a relative or friend to medical appointments they don't have to disclose sensitive information (domestic abuse, mental health issues, sexual problems) to their families to get help they don't have to impose the burden of being a go-between on young children and according the centre for inner city health, they believe the quality of the care is better when they can communicate without fear of being misinterpreted by their health-care provider
health-care providers have more confidence in the information they are getting from patients they don't have to deal with difficult family dynamics they can involve patients in their own treatment and they can be sure their instructions are being conveyed to the patient accurately """"it has fundamentally changed who we are able to offer services to,"""" one health-care provider said
the researchers did find a few gaps and weaknesses:
elderly patients often don't like - and won't use - the technology the special dial-in code and the delays patching everybody into the conversation frustrate them
the service is inappropriate for people with dementia or paranoia for them, disembodied voices can be confusing or threatening
it is obviously unsuitable for hard-of-hearing patients
the interpreter's gender can make some conversations difficult
the cost is a barrier for certain community agencies
and some patients prefer the old method
on balance, however, the evaluation team gives the program high marks and recommends expansion with a few adjustments
with the face of urban canada rapidly changing, it is heartening to see toronto take the lead in keeping medicare open and equitable

responding to the same kind of public outcry that greeted the boat people in canada, australian immigration minister philip ruddock has boasted of sending the migrants back in large numbers
but australia is once again besieged: another  migrants have appeared so far this month, including a record boatload of  passengers from the middle east last week
more than , people have come by sea so far this year, ten times the figure for  ruddock believes the total could yet double in the coming days, with , migrants poised to slip through australia dragnet
""""australia simply cannot afford to be seen as a potential soft target by    the increasingly sophisticated people-smuggling rackets,"""" he said

unlike canada, australia immediately throws all its illegal arrivals into detention camps scattered across the country mandatory detention is considered a deterrent to potential migrants, who know they will languish behind barbed wire for at least a month, if not longer, before emerging from the refugee-determination process
that the theory, often cited by canadians who believe australia is better at stopping abuses in reality, the queue of suspected queue-jumpers is just getting longer
overwhelmed by the crush of migrants, australia has thrown up tent cities at its isolated detention camps, but still can't keep up an air base in curtin, western australia, is overflowing; now, the government is converting an old rocket range at woomera, in the south australia desert, into a temporary camp
for all the tough talk in australia, there are few signs that anyone offshore is getting the message
""""getting tough isn't going to stem the tide,"""" said ian holloway, who teaches international law at australian national university in the capital city of canberra

""""the lesson to be learned from australia is that, for refugees, living in a detention camp, however awful it may seem to us, is still better than what they have at home,"""" he said
holloway said australia tougher approach is a legacy of the country traditional fear of being swamped by outsiders, beginning when chinese labourers flocked to australia southern coast for the gold rush of the mid-s
the so-called white australia policy discriminated against foreigners for the first half of this century by forcing immigrants to pass an english dictation test
""""australia for a long time saw itself as a white bastion in the midst of asiatic hordes,"""" holloway said """"that why australia adopted a more militaristic and authoritarian approach than canada did""""
but placing migrants in detention may not be legal
australia human rights and equal opportunity commission has said the detention policy """"breaches international human rights standards, which permit detention only where necessary"""" the commission investigated conditions in the various detention facilities and found them """"inadequate and in violation of human rights when people    are detained for prolonged periods""""

but the immigration minister has rejected the criticism from human rights groups a member of amnesty for two decades, ruddock insists the policy is legal and the only effective way to ensure claimants will be deported if their refugee claims are rejected

as of last month, anyone who successfully makes it through the refugee-determination process will receive only a three-year """"temporary protection visa"""" or a short-term """"safe haven visa,"""" instead of the permanent visas that refugees received in the past
after the three-year period, the refugee status is reviewed and if conditions permit, they are sent back
while all these measures are backed by the opposition labour party, a political battle is shaping up over the government most controversial proposal: removing the right of asylum- seekers to appeal their cases to the courts if they are turned down by the refugee review tribunal

240283606,"Doors open for skilled migrants: Facing a labour shortage, Canada is easing entry requirements for talented foreigners. Pauline Tam reports.:   [Final Edition ]","At the very least, the headhunter had to show government officials that there was a shortage of Canadians with Mr. [Wahed Ali Mohammed]'s background in managing financial software. While some specialized high-tech workers can bypass this lengthy process, the system made no exceptions for someone with Mr. Ali Mohammed's more general skills. The high-tech sector has been at the forefront of the skills gap issue because it has felt the most acute shortages. But other industries -- including biotech -- are organizing similar lobbies. They argue that the government must not only boost immigration and attract more foreign recruits into the country; it must also develop programs that will encourage skilled foreigners to choose Canada over the U.S. or Europe. Mr. Ali Mohammed, the Cognos employee, is one example. Starting with a six-month work permit that allowed him to take a temporary job in Mississauga, he then found a longer-term position with Cognos in Ottawa. The company is sponsoring not only Mr. Ali Mohammed's bid to become a landed immigrant, but also that of his wife and two children, who are in the country with temporary papers.","  when wahed ali mohammed accepted a six-month contract with a high- tech company in mississauga, it took four months before he was finally allowed to leave his native india
the long processing delay is a typical hurdle faced by many foreign hires to canada in mr ali mohammed's case, it required the canadian recruiter offering him the job to first prove its chosen hire had skills that were not available in this country
at the very least, the headhunter had to show government officials that there was a shortage of canadians with mr ali mohammed's background in managing financial software while some specialized high-tech workers can bypass this lengthy process, the system made no exceptions for someone with mr ali mohammed's more general skills
""""i didn't go through any special channels to come to canada i had to go through the regular channels,"""" says the -year-old software engineer, now an employee of ottawa-based cognos inc
but increasingly, those regular channels are disappearing as it becomes easier for skilled foreigners -- particularly those with engineering, computer and technical expertise -- to take jobs in canada the north american free trade deal has increased the movement of people across borders, as have other international trade agreements
more significantly, the system is being overhauled because canada is suffering the first symptoms of a widespread labour shortage
after years of enforcing a strict policy that discourages canadian companies from importing talent, the federal government is allowing a larger number of foreign recruits to hold temporary work permits
in some cases, that means employers will no longer have to prove that foreign candidates would not displace or create more competition for qualified canadians seeking work
already, a select group of high-tech workers can enter more quickly companies offering work to these recruits no longer have to present job advertisements proving they have tried to hire comparable canadians capable of doing the work without this requirement, companies can often bring foreign hires into the country within days, rather than months
""""we have never opened the door just to open the door,"""" says lucy bisson, a spokeswoman at the federal human resources department """"normally, when people come to work in canada, it's because the skills or knowledge doesn't exist, or is in short supply in canada""""
in fact, the growing labour gap is no longer confined to the hot sectors of the computer economy
industries ranging from biotechnology to tool-and-die are also experiencing an alarming shortage of skilled talent
""""i have a very strong feeling that these labour shortage issues are more serious than government agencies and the professional groups fully understand,"""" says howard greenberg, a toronto-based immigration lawyer
""""my sense is that if we don't address these labour shortages in the short and medium term with a large infusion of qualified workers from abroad, the result with be that these jobs will go elsewhere""""
the much-debated brain drain to the united states is one cause of the problem but an aging population is making it worse
a recently published report concludes that canada faces a critical labour shortage within a decade as the first wave of baby boomers starts to retire the study by the vancouver-based urban futures institute warns that replacing -- and supporting -- a growing population of retirees presents enormous challenges for canada, since the boom generation represents one-third of the country's population
the high-tech sector has been at the forefront of the skills gap issue because it has felt the most acute shortages but other industries -- including biotech -- are organizing similar lobbies they argue that the government must not only boost immigration and attract more foreign recruits into the country; it must also develop programs that will encourage skilled foreigners to choose canada over the us or europe
one of those new programs allows the spouses of foreign recruits, like kristin fransen, to take jobs while they are in the country
last month, ms fransen, , started her job as a lab technician at the national research council in ottawa but as recently as a year ago, when she first arrived as the wife of a visiting scientist from belgium, ms fransen was not allowed to work
that's because canada followed the example of the us and most european countries, which continue to bar spouses of foreign recruits from taking jobs for fear they might displace qualified nationals seeking work but canada's policy changed last fall with a federal government experiment aimed at attracting potential recruits who otherwise wouldn't consider coming here
in ms fransen's case, her work permit -- and the nrc job offer - - have provided an incentive for the couple to remain in canada for a second, possibly even a third year, so that her husband, an acoustic engineer, can finish his research fellowship
""""if it had become difficult for me to get an employment authorization, we would have returned to belgium this summer,"""" says ms fransen """"we wouldn't have considered staying in canada longer because it's really hard for two people to live on one salary""""
according to mr greenberg, whose clients include several of canada's top high-tech firms, the number of people entering the country through these special routes is not significant enough to create concerns about extra job competition for canadians
indeed, the federal citizenship and immigration department says that of , temporary work permits issued to foreigners last year, only , were for software workers who qualified under the fast-track process another  permits were issued to spouses of skilled foreign workers
while it is not known how many temporary workers and their spouses choose to remain in canada as citizens, the reality is that a large number of foreign recruits -- with the notable exception of those with us citizenship -- do decide to stay for good, says mr greenberg
mr ali mohammed, the cognos employee, is one example starting with a six-month work permit that allowed him to take a temporary job in mississauga, he then found a longer-term position with cognos in ottawa the company is sponsoring not only mr ali mohammed's bid to become a landed immigrant, but also that of his wife and two children, who are in the country with temporary papers
mr greenberg says many companies are helping their foreign recruits settle permanently in canada because it gives them a competitive advantage in the race for international talent """"i'm under a mandate from some companies to immigrate the fathers and mothers of employees so that they plant some deep roots in canada and aren't as likely to leave for the us""""
for the majority of companies looking for talent abroad, there are other ways to bring skilled foreigners into the country quickly, without first having to show that they have searched for qualified canadians
federal immigration laws have long allowed companies to make a case for foreign recruits if they can show that the chosen hire will create jobs or turn around failing businesses
in practice, that means frontline immigration officers have wide discretion over whether a foreign recruit will be of """"significant"""" benefit to the country
""""every time i've presented the significant benefits case, i've succeeded,"""" says suzanne bailey, an immigration lawyer with the toronto-based firm blaney mcmurtry """"i haven't had a case where they've turned me down but i advise my clients that that can happen""""
still, the provision is often """"overlooked and underused"""" by immigration lawyers, says ms bailey
but by far the most common route to canada for most foreign workers is through international treaties, such as the north american free trade agreement and the general agreement on trade and services these agreements allow multinational businesses to arrange a wide range of transfers within the company so that employees can move freely from one country to another
such a provision allowed the canadian-owned media giant thomson corp, for example, to bring a technology manager at one of its us publications across the border to the toronto headquarters of its flagship newspaper, the globe and mail
the daily, which is embroiled in a newspaper war with southam's national post, recently hired a number of high-level management staff, including editor-in-chief richard addis, formerly of the daily express in london, who recently took up his job at the globe
the appointment has attracted controversy in newspaper circles because it leaves the top three jobs at the country's national newspaper in the hands of people from outside canada mr addis and publisher phillip crawley are british, while roger parkinson, the globe's chairman and former publisher, is american
mr crawley, who worked previously in hong kong and new zealand, has deflected criticism about his management team's ability to grasp canadian affairs by arguing that they are ready to take advice from the majority of the globe's editorial staff who come from canada
""""i don't think nationalism is very good grounds for recruiting talent,"""" says mr crawley, adding that he also hired a former colleague from new zealand as the globe's new production manager
""""i'm not quite sure why having a british editor or an american it (information technology) vice-president, or a new zealand production director is an issue at all it's something that canada has absorbed and thrived on for many years""""
in the case of mr addis, says mr crawley, the paper hired a recruiting firm to conduct a """"wide-ranging search"""" of proper candidates in the us, europe, asia as well as canada
but the company still had to convince immigration officials that their foreign hire was justified
""""we were prepared to show that we did a global search and show that wide range of skills needed for the job may be of a kind that are in short supply,"""" says mr crawley
""""if we wanted somebody who was simply an expert on canada, there are many people who would qualify under that heading""""",The Ottawa Citizen,1999-09-08,1999,9,8

but like the """"great sickness"""" that bedevilled many of the brave men, women and children who set out for the new world on-board the mayflower, a persistent pestilence had other ideas
planners in plymouth, england, watched in dismay last spring as the covid- pandemic laid waste to planned th anniversary celebrations of that epic voyage events were postponed or scuppered outright as it became clear the plague was not going away quietly
in many ways, it was a chilling echo of that day on sept , , when a cramped merchant vessel carrying  migrants and roughly  crew left the port city in southwestern england for a -day, ,-nautical mile journey across the """"vast and furious ocean"""" to a new life
with its arrival in november  on the shores of what is now the united states, the mayflower - which would typically haul wine, timber, tar and herring - disgorged a sickly band of pilgrims seeking religious and economic freedom
along the way, they would help plant the seeds of american democracy, foster a tradition of thanksgiving day feasts - leaving millions of nervous turkeys in their wake - and sire more than  million progeny
last year was to have been the """"world's biggest family reunion"""" as mayflower descendants from every corner of the world celebrated in sites throughout plymouth and elsewhere in the uk - the culmination of six years of preparation
that had to be scaled back massively because of the health crisis, but organizers are promising a """"spectacular"""" grand finale this july - the four nations commemoration ceremony - as restrictions are eased across britain and beyond
and while the mayflower may seem a quintessentially american story, organizers in britain said interest among canadians is growing
""""we know there are  million mayflower descendants around the world, with  million in the us,"""" mark howell, marketing director of the mayfloweruk organizing committee, said """"and of course that means there are  million elsewhere, including canada""""
much as it has derailed plans and claimed lives today, a mysterious illness known as the """"great sickness"""" would cut a deadly swath through those who made the perilous journey  years ago indeed, only half of those who set sail from plymouth would survive the journey and the brutal first winter in what became the state of massachusetts
of those who did, the sight of indigenous corpses scattered amid their new home was a ghastly reminder of the deadly epidemics wrought by european exploration
but the pilgrims persevered and within  years a """"prosperously expanding"""" colony flowered on the eastern seaboard among its famous ancestors: ashley judd, clint eastwood, george w bush, bing crosby, richard gere and marilyn monroe
though the pilgrims - who were divided into religious separatists, or """"saints,"""" and economic migrants, the """"strangers"""" - are also linked with the english midlands and the netherlands, it is plymouth, their last port of call, with which they are indelibly bound it was here the weary emigrants, desperate to leave the cramped mayflower after a succession of false starts, spent several days being """"kindly entertained"""" among the bars and bakeries of the barbican quarter
thronged with sailors and explorers, the cobbled streets of the barbican and sutton harbour embraced the emigrants, though fishermen freshly returned from the cod banks off newfoundland warned darkly against crossing the atlantic in late september sympathetic to the cause of religious freedom - and long a centre for traders, adventurers and political agitators - plymouth was cosmopolitan and globalized well before its time
many landmarks from that era remain among the -plus tudor and jacobean heritage structures in barbican's warren of lanes, including elizabethan house and gardens; black friars, the oldest working gin distillery in england; and jacka's bakery, which provided hardtack (a type of biscuit) for the ship's galley
nearby is the poignant mayflower steps memorial and mayflower museum, which tells the story of the migration over three floors pick up a copy of the  passenger list from the gift shop you might spot a distant cousin
for food options, nothing tops an open-air north atlantic burger at cap'n jaspers snack stand
stare down thieving gulls while admiring the smart flats and cafés breathing new life into plymouth's oldest neighbourhood
history buffs should stagger over to the minerva inn on looe street serving punters since , the city's oldest pub is rife with ghostly tales of levitating spoons, jukeboxes playing unbidden and spectral prostitutes lurking under the dartboard sir francis drake lived a few doors away
to the west of the barbican is the hoe, the green expanse overlooking plymouth sound where sir francis is said to have merrily continued his game of lawn bowling as the spanish armada advanced up the english channel in  more prosaically, it's said he was merely waiting out bad weather a statue pays tribute

Jean Louis Roux last week because of his pro-fascist actions in 1942 exposed the different attitude of the times towards Jews, not only in Quebec, but across Canada. ``Jews were demeaned and despised and discriminated against,'' says Irving Abella, a York University history professor and past president of the Canadian Jewish Congress. ``It was a period in which the Jews were the pariah of Canadian society.''

Restrictive covenants or ``gentlemen's agreements'' and quotas kept Jews out of certain professions, neighborhoods, social clubs and some universities.

In 1933, there was a bloody four-hour race riot between Toronto gentiles and Jews that sent many to hospital.","analysis: the resignation of quebec lieutenant-governor jean louis roux last week because of his pro-fascist actions in  exposed the different attitude of the times towards jews, not only in quebec, but across canada
when quebec lieutenant-governor jean-louis roux abruptly resigned last week because of his pro-fascist actions in , accusations flew over the anti-semitism of many quebecers during a particularly ugly nationalistic period
but was english canada any better?
today is remembrance day, and among those memories is the painful fact that during the period leading up to and including the second world war, many english canadians did not display the tolerance or sympathy for jews that we, today, feel should have been self-evident
``jews were demeaned and despised and discriminated against,'' says irving abella, a york university history professor and past president of the canadian jewish congress ``it was a period in which the jews were the pariah of canadian society''
``it was not only quebec, that's the important thing''
in the s, ``swastika clubs'' formed in toronto and other ontario communities restrictive covenants or ``gentlemen's agreements'' and quotas kept jews out of certain professions, neighborhoods, social clubs and some universities many businesses proudly posted ``gentiles only'' signs in , there was a bloody four-hour race riot between toronto gentiles and jews that sent many to hospital
two years later in ottawa, an intensely anti-semitic local policeman, jean tissot, ran unsuccessfully for parliament and called for a consumer boycott of jewish stores he specifically targeted archie freiman, one of the city's most prominent businessmen tissot got almost , votes
and three years before, roux, as a quebec university student, wore a swastika and participated in a  anti-conscription, anti-semitic demonstration in montreal, the federal government turned away a ship carrying more than  desperate jewish refugees fleeing europe most of the refugees later died in nazi concentration camps
the backdrop for much of this bigotry was the great depression and the economic fear and anxiety of those hard times some people, disillusioned with democratic politics, flirted with fascism, believing it could restore economic order and make the trains run on time (that flirtation largely ended in english canada when the second world war began and patriotism swept the country)
others sought scapegoats and, subtly backed by some theological tenets of christianity, thought of jews as an easy mark
in english canada, many people of anglo-saxon stock believed the essence of canada was defined by its british roots, traditions and protestantism that growing nativism led some to view jews as aliens, who were unworthy, if not incapable, of being assimilated into canadian society
such anti-semitic voices in english canada were a scattered but noisy minority, and part of a broader xenophobic mindset by , for example, canada had imprisoned , japanese-canadians
some people, including canadian church leaders, loudly and bitterly condemned the spreading nazi persecutions of jews beginning in the mid-s but there was no unified voice and christian canadians at large had a difficult time believing the stories of persecution in europe were true, says marilyn nefsky, a professor of sociology and religious studies at the university of lethbridge
what worry there was about the fate of the jews was overshadowed by the economic and social problems at home
``this was happening over there and we had our own problems to deal with here, so let's deal with our problems before we go worrying about other people,'' nefsky summarizes
for the average protestant and catholic citizen of ottawa and toronto in the late s, that meant a general apathy (as opposed to tacit approval) over the plight of european jews and, for some, a latent anti-semitism toward jews at home
some people feared that the jews, especially recent immigrants from eastern europe, were ungodly, bolshevik communists some worried about jews taking away precious jobs the stereotype of the hebrews as an acquisitive, cosmopolitan class with an aversion to manual labor conflicted with the canadian ideal of strong backs and a pioneering spirit
more extreme elements, says university of toronto professor of religion alan davies, viewed jews much the same way many germans did: as the source of the country's troubles
and what average citizens heard from some politicians and read in the press sometimes only reinforced those sentiments
at a  toronto council meeting, the mayor called an alderman a `bloody jew'' and went to on say: ``i have no more respect for a jew than hitler has it is time he was told he was a hebrew and what a gentile thinks of a hebrew''
two years later, when the nomad german liner, the st louis, carrying german jewish passengers, was turned away from cuba, the united states and then canada, a citizen editorial called the situation tragic and ``hoped'' a ``satisfactory solution'' was found it said nothing about actually accepting the  doomed souls aboard what came to be known as ``the voyage of the damned''
we now have more than  years of hindsight on which to judge those attitudes the moral choices seem obvious today but given the context of those times, can we condemn the ethical values of the day? would we have acted differently?

cue the inevitable tropes about obscurantist religion in fact, religion has some important contributions to thinking about rights but first, let me say that it's most unfortunate that this case ever came to be determined by a question of competing rights
it is far better that the pedagogical expectations of the professor be made known at the outset of the course it is my understanding that for this online course, the requirement of in-person group work was added after the beginning of the course and the student's participation in it
when all requirements are known in advance, students can decide for whatever reasons to take a course or not it appears that, in the end, the professor and student were able to come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement
human rights are an invaluable tool in fighting historic injustices and guarding against new ones the contribution christians may make to thinking about human rights - and people of other faiths may share this perspective - is to ground human rights in the belief that all human beings are related to god independently of their relation to any earthly political or social system
at the same time, religious faith constantly reminds us of our mutual belonging and reciprocity rights are but one dimension of these relationships, for we are all inevitably embedded in concrete cultures
if human rights remain aspirational abstractions or simply laws to be enforced by whoever has the coercive power to do so, it is not clear that human rights will always be recognized as such
christians did not begin with an abstract notion of human equality, but rather discovered that the logic of life lived in relation to jesus of nazareth required learning to live with difference for the sake of the common goal of the flourishing of human life
abdul rashid is a member of the ottawa muslim community, the christian-muslim dialogue and the capital region interfaith council
no, york university was wrong
canada is uniquely rich in being a multicultural, multiethnic, multi-religious society more important, a significant segment of the population consists of recent immigrants who may not be fully conversant with the norms in canada
however, the canadians are mutually understanding and respectful be that as it may, there are likely occasional squabbles, most of which are usually settled without much fuss
the case of this york university student is an example of creating more difficulties by solving one apparently, a male student, religion unknown, enrolled in an internet course as he did not want to intermingle with female students when asked to participate in a mixedgender group project, he sought exemption
as reported in the ottawa citizen, the professor """"consulted a scholar of judaism and two islamic scholars, all of whom saw no religious reason why someone would not want to interact in public with women satisfied that the request was not justified, the professor rejected it
interestingly, the student accepted the decision and participated in the group session, thanking the professor """"for the way you have handled this request""""
the university then entered the picture and opened an amicably settled and closed case by overruling the professor it sought legal opinion, and consulted the ontario human rights code and the university's own human rights centre the result was that the whole issue was given a new life and controversy and it became a major story with all sorts of comments and observations
the university's intent may be laudable, but it forgot that the objective of the various institutions it consulted was to maintain peace and tranquility in the society the university action did the opposite by creating a new controversy
jack mclean is a baha'i scholar, teacher, essayist and poet published in the fields of spirituality, baha'i theology and poetry
the baha'i faith, the youngest of the independent world religions, has promoted the advancement of women and sexual equality virtually from the early beginnings of the religion in iran, on may , , with the prophetic declaration of the bab (the gate), who announced the coming of the prophet-founder, baha'u'llah (the glory of god)
although these progressive principles were more easily accepted in western europe and north america, in the baha'i communities of the middle east, their application had to be necessarily more gradual because of religious laws and social customs that enforced rigid gender segregation in a patriarchal society
one of the bab's  most distinguished disciples was a brilliant poet-theologian-orator named tahirih (the pure one) tahirih was strangled, and her body was thrown into a well in a garden in north tehran, not only because she believed in the bab, but also because she promoted the education of women
the usual justification invoked for the segregation of men and women based on religious belief is the distraction principle, or a perceived threat to chastity spatial proximity will necessarily lead to sexual impropriety, according to this fear however, the practice of chastity should not be based on sexual segregation, but rather on maintaining a pure heart
baha'u'llah counsels: """"let your eye be chaste, your hand faithful, your tongue truthful and your heart enlightened"""" this quotation squarely places the responsibility for chastity on the individual, not on the manipulation of dress or the environment
there is some validity to the """"slippery slope"""" argument when the issue of """"reasonable accommodation"""" is discussed let us take the complainant's request based on shariah further is he later going to request that his employer segregate women from men in the workplace? will he refuse to be served by a female cashier? will he also request that the sexes be segregated in the cafeteria? will he also ask that the sexes be educated separately in the public schools? reasonable accommodation must be reasonable, and it must work both ways is he willing to reasonably accommodate a belief system that includes gender equality? if so, there are no grounds for complaint

our world includes many interest groups, many with the power to embarrass or obstruct if they don't get their way it is disappointing that any group can generate such fear that institutions are afraid to offend we hope for leaders who can see beyond the threat of """"bad press"""" at every turn and operate at the level of principle, rather than politics alone
we can't all be experts in every religion (even if we read this column regularly), and appropriate help is not far away when we need it
i was reminded of a friend, an experienced public school teacher in a multicultural neighbourhood one year, he was advised by his administration to be vigilant at the approach of ramadan, the arduous month-long islamic fast period the muslim students, he was told, would try to get away with poor behaviour, with the excuse that they were fasting and they had trouble controlling themselves
he was curious, and suggested a meeting with the parents to find out their expectations to the surprise of the school, the parents were disappointed in what they had heard, since their belief was that behaviour should be even better than usual during ramadan by going a bit further than the jerk of a knee, everyone learned something helpful another issue in this question is the apparent contradiction between a school's striving for religious sensitivity and its commitment to respect the rights of women what would the school have done if the student had expressed a religious objection to participating with a specific racial group or homosexuals? religious sensitivity cannot trump human rights and our principles of respectful tolerance
balpreet singh is legal counsel and acting executive director for the world sikh organization of canada
as a sikh, my faith teaches me that men and women are equal and guarantees them equal rights but my faith also teaches me to defend freedom of religion as a principle, even where i may fundamentally disagree with a particular religious practice
the general reaction to the york student who didn't wish to work with women was rightly one of shock and disapproval the overwhelming majority of people of all faiths can appreciate how important the interaction and co-operation of men and women is to our society
however, the question isn't whether we agree with the student's religious beliefs or not, but whether york was right to allow his request for accommodation
the right to freedom of religion in canada protects an individual's sincerely held personal beliefs, which must be accommodated to the point of undue hardship
just as we go to great lengths to tolerate diverse viewpoints in order to uphold freedom of expression, similarly, we must be willing to tolerate (and accommodate) diverse religious beliefs, regardless of how strongly we may disagree with them, so long as the rights of others are not infringed
in the case at hand, a york student had enrolled for an online course and asked for an exemption from an in-person group assignment such an exemption had already been provided to another student for an alternative reason
although the york student's religious beliefs are unusual and ones that the vast majority of us cannot agree with, the fact is that he could have discretely been accommodated without a negative impact on other students such an accommodation would have been limited to this online course and certainly could not be offered on campus, where intergender interaction is unavoidable therefore, even though i am in complete disagreement with the york student's religious belief, canadian law and the principle of freedom of religion would provide that he could indeed have been accommodated

but the quiet and concentration aren't enough the word """"majolica"""" defeats seven senior spellers, aged  to , who clearly have never heard of the th-century earthenware
in a culture that reveres brains like that of bill gates almost as much as athletic brawn, spelling bees - such as the one held last weekend in mississauga - are enjoying a revival in north america after getting their start in the s
that revival has piqued with some big-screen attention
sometimes referred to as the sport of nerds, bees have been the backdrop for the new movie akeelah and the bee and last year's film bee season the scripps national spelling bee in the united states was the subject of the  oscar-nominated documentary spellbound
on top of that, there's the broadway musical the th annual putnam county spelling bee, which picked up a tony award and next month, abc plans, for the first time, to televise the scripps spelling bee live, during prime time
the dramatic potential is obvious in the disappointed faces of spellers who step off the mississauga stage, their hopes dashed by the pronouncement of """"incorrect"""" by the judge

this year, the bristol road middle school student studied about two hours a day for more than a month before the saturday competition still, he clutched a well-worn copy of the spellers' bible, the official spelling manual  edition
""""the more you read, the more words you recognize,"""" said the grade  harry potter fan
but """"majolica"""" came in the fifth round of competition during the first two rounds, contestants spell words listed in the manual, but after that words are selected from the dictionary these tiebreaker rounds separate the kids who have memorized the manual from those who read and engage in the language on a deeper level, say bee organizers and parents
in the end, ahnch's schoolmate, vyshaly sathiamoorthy, , went  rounds over three gruelling hours to take first place her winning words """"satiate"""" and """"bourgeoisie"""" propelled her to the spelling bee of canada finals on may  at the university of toronto

spence said she thinks ontario's growing diversity may be contributing to interest here the contests were a highlight of her jamaican childhood where neighbours would gather around the radio to hear local children compete
spelling is at the foundation of literacy, spence said spell a word wrong on your resume and you won't get the job, she tells the kids she coaches but just as important as expanding vocabulary, the contests build confidence
""""nothing feels better than when you have an audience looking at you you're representing your community and you feel proud,"""" she said
spelling bee of canada is a community-based, rather than school- based, competition, although teachers and principals steer children to the coaching sessions and contests

grumblers say liberals haven't taken the canny jason kenney, federal immigration minister and grassroots manipulator, seriously enough, allowing him to forage for votes largely unattended in liberal ridings with strong ethnic communities, with an aim to picking them off and building a majority

abi-karam, who has lived on welfare and worked for low wages as a general labourer since arriving in canada in february , is among thousands of unemployed and underemployed skilled immigrants
arriving here with solid education and work experience, they often find they cannot get their credentials recognized, either by employers or the three dozen or so bodies that regulate professionals such as engineers, physiotherapists, teachers, doctors, nurses and social workers

""""it a canadian-first, inward-looking attitude that says, 'we know what we're doing'""""
as long as that attitude persists, canada will continue to fail in realizing the full potential of its immigrants, which is essential if our economic prosperity is to grow, rasheed added
the vital link between immigration and prosperity was underscored in an april report by the canadian federation of independent business in a survey of small- and medium-sized employers, it found an estimated , jobs were vacant for four months or longer in  and half the small business owners called staff shortages """"an issue of concern"""" for them
""""while exacerbated by canada current healthy economy, this problem appears far from temporary,"""" the federation said in its report """"the aging population and limited labour force growth suggests this problem will be with us for some time - perhaps worsening in the months and years ahead""""

""""we are getting better but there still a long way to go,"""" owen said of the willingness in canada to hire foreign-trained workers """"there still a lot of barriers for people trained overseas
""""we know, anecdotally, that people are still having trouble getting hired appropriately""""
rasheed sees it every day while the education qualifications of newcomers are increasingly being recognized, canadian employers and regulatory bodies are reluctant to accept as legitimate the experience people have received overseas, she said that means newcomers often can't get in the door, even though it clear they can do the job and would bring knowledge, skills and innovative thinking to their new post
hireimmigrantsca is trying to get employers to focus on the benefits of taking on newcomers
the project, funded by the federal and provincial governments, as well as the charitable maytree foundation, which is committed to reducing poverty and inequality in canada, uses a host of tools including a website and seminars, to let executives from companies who have hired immigrants explain to their business colleagues why it was a good move

this fear takes many shapes - fear of what is foreign and unknown, fear of one own ability to cope in the face of competition from this unknown, fear of losing one own status, privilege and power, fear of any kind of change
you can see this in the current wrangling over language rights across canada you can see it in the powerful homophobia - fear of same-sex love - that permeates not only the united church of canada just now but almost every corner of our society
it is at work wherever jews are hated or any other minority group it has always been at the root of all religious persecution and discrimination
but those who are filled with this kind of prejudice or intolerance are much too cowardly to acknowledge their fear instead, they dress it up or disguise it with all sorts of high- sounding phrases
their real concern, they say, is with the future of the country, or the church, or the family they offer themselves as the devoted guardians of """"our way of life"""" or of """"the truth"""" but their inner terror has blinded them to the real meaning of either term
i say this because we know that the bedrock of our way of life and of any truth worthy of the name is true compassion and equality for all the only fundamental that is worth being categorically fundamentalist about is love all the rest of ethics is embroidery on this theme
love is not some kind of hollywood or soap opera mindless mush it can have emotional overtones but it is not primarily a matter of the emotions at all when we speak of loving our neighbor, we are not even necessarily talking about liking or disliking him/her nobody can like everybody
love is supremely a matter of the will it means to will the very best for all others, especially the poor, the outcast and the weak its genuineness cannot be faked because it always shows itself in specific acts
love casts out the demon of fear that lies behind all social hatreds because it refuses to deal in stereotypes, cliches, and group labels it cuts through all the paraphernalia of prejudice to the reality beneath - the other human person whose hopes and needs and joys are so very like our own
above all, this kind of love, without which no truly human community life is possible at any level, municipal, provincial, federal or global, tries to talk with and listen to the other party without dialogue, love dies social harmony becomes impossible
having been born in ontario and having lived here all of my life, except for four years of study in england, i feel ashamed that several ontario communities have been so foolish and shortsighted as to pronounce themselves to be officially unilingual
this sends a negative message not just to french-speaking canadians but particularly to our young people they are going to live in a world which will increasingly be one """"village"""" knowing two or more languages and coming from a country which is enthusiastically bilingual would give them a tremendous background for contributing to further global understanding
the present, mean-spirited bickering and sniping over language both within quebec and across the country augurs poorly for our ability to help in solving much wider problems abroad
as one trying to be a christian, it is a source of embarrassment and pain that so much prejudice exists within christian circles
it exists against jews and those of other faiths, against persons of color, and against homosexuals in the case of gays, the fear is masked by protestations of devotion to biblical integrity and """"the preservation of the family""""
the bitterness of the campaign to oppose and to discriminate against homosexuals is directly related to the amount of moral and theological rectitude claimed by their attackers
what has struck me about united church opponents of gay ministers whom i have met is that they so often know little or nothing about the subject they seldom seem to know any homosexuals, church members or otherwise as for dialogue with christian homosexuals, forget it!
the united church is headed for its general council in london, ont, this coming august on every side, clergy and laity opposed to the position taken by the last council, in morden manitoba, leaving ordination open to all members regardless of sexual orientation, are gearing up for a major showdown it could wreck the denomination
it time the racists and the homophobics alike admitted and faced up to their fears if they did, there would be much more reconciliation and much less confrontation across this great land

a defence official who briefed the citizen about vance's directive, on condition of anonymity, stressed that the numbers housed by the military could be much smaller
the canadian forces and the defence department are not leading the government initiative but are standing by to provide support
military personnel are already starting to """"reactivate"""" some of the facilities that could be used, including barracks and cadet camps usually used for summer training some accommodations can be immediately used without any preparation specific details on how the liberal government plans to proceed are expected soon

the official said vance's directive is designed to get military staff prepared for supporting the plan to bring , syrian refugees to canada by the end of the year that number and timetable were key liberal promises during the federal election campaign
vance's directive does not provide specifics because the government has not provided detailed information
""""for instance, when this order was issued, we didn't know air canada was going to propose providing aircraft,"""" the official said the airline has said it could help bring some syrians to canada
john mccallum, minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, said at a news conference this week that the federal government is considering using ships and commercial and military aircraft to transport the refugees to canada
mccallum also said the liberal government might lodge the refugees at canadian military bases upon their arrival
once the government gives federal departments more details on how it wants to proceed, the military's participation will be coordinated by the canadian joint operations command in ottawa

""""It shows incredible chutzpah for Jews to try to tell blacks what they should find offensive,"""" added Carol Tator, a prominent member of the Jewish community who has worked for 20 years as a consultant on race relations. She also opposes Show Boat.","garth drabinsky show boat hasn't yet arrived in metro, but debate about the musical has already created an unprecedented wave of tension between metro black and jewish communities
some jews point to what they see as ugly anti-semitism woven into the debate about the propriety of putting on the  american musical
some blacks say staging the musical - which they find deeply offensive because of its portrayal in past performances of blacks - in itself amounts to racism
when it comes to the north york performing arts centre in october, show boat will be sailing on a gulf of misunderstanding separating two communities
but this isn't a debate about show boat
it a debate about the debate
first, there is really no such thing as a monolithic """"black community,"""" or a """"jewish community"""" there are blacks who support the show and jews who condemn it
but many jews feel wounded and threatened by what they're hearing from some blacks and many blacks are offended by show boat and by the actions of those backing the production, who happen to be jewish
some opponents of the production of the kern and hammerstein musical have said that as a jew himself, drabinsky should have known better than to put on a show considered offensive by members of another minority group and they've called on the jewish community at large to condemn the production
but the canadian jewish congress sees the situation as more serious because:
* a letter circulated to parents in north york schools seeking endorsements of the anti- show boat coalition compared the north york performing arts centre to a gas chamber
* north york board of education trustee stephnie payne, a vocal opponent of show boat, said in a television interview that productions denigrating blacks are often done by jews she has since apologized
* at public forums called to debate show boat, anti-jewish remarks have been made by some members of the audience
* editorials, columns and letters to the editor published in the black community weekly newspaper share have focused on jews and gone beyond the show boat issue
""""when the local mainstream media, especially citytv and the toronto sun, both headed by jews, make it their specialty to focus on crime in the black community    i don't hear your voices of protest,"""" share editor arnold auguste wrote in an editorial april 
""""the book on which the musical ( show boat) is based was written by a jew the musical was written, scored and produced by jews - i mean someone who is jewish actually sat down and wrote about 'niggers' someone who is jewish is producing it here in our city and a jewish mayor is opening the doors of one of our most prestigious theatres with it   
""""i would have opposed show boat regardless of who were involved but i hurt a lot more because of who are involved,"""" auguste wrote in another editorial
share columnist odida t quamina accused the united way of giving a disproportionate amount of its funding to jewish organizations, based on figures the charity itself says are way off the mark (the united way is contributing to the production of show boat, a decision that has caused some black members of the charity board to resign)
the share newspaper has also been sprinkled with letters to the editor criticizing the economic relationship between israel and white south africa, for example, or talking about the enslavement of black workers by jewish mine owners in south africa
a recent share report on a concert by a famous calypso singer quoted his lyrics, talking about wrongs perpetrated by the """"jewish clan""""
""""everyone in this country has to be concerned that the opposition to show boat, however legitimate it might be, has degenerated into an anti-semitic assault on the jewish community,"""" said manuel prutschi, executive director of the canadian jewish congress, ontario region
""""there been a focusing on the jewishness of those involved with show boat, past and present,"""" prutschi said """"the jewish community collectively is being held responsible for the acts of some individuals who happen to be jewish,"""" he said
for his part, drabinsky says the tone of criticism of his production has been hurtful
""""i don't think there any question the debate has been tainted (by anti-semitism) was that the intention from the beginning? probably not,"""" drabinsky said in an interview
share editor auguste makes no apologies
""""i think what they want is to alienate me from my community i think what they want to do is to discredit me this is not about me, this thing started before i even got involved, this thing started with other people expressing how hurt they are, how unhappy
""""it hard for you to understand, not having lived as a black person,"""" auguste said
auguste makes no bones about holding jews up to a higher standard when, for example, they own media outlets that he believes portray blacks negatively
jewish community leaders like prutschi think that is blatant anti- semitism
but auguste goes on
""""i'm not saying it because they're jews they're doing this, but because they're jews they shouldn't be doing this the trouble is sometimes the message gets all screwed up""""
and some prominent members of the black community wonder if the debate about the debate has become one-sided
""""if you are going to look at anti-semitism in the black community, are you going to look at anti-black racism in the jewish community?"""" one social commentator from the black community asked
""""in my opinion it is a smokescreen,"""" said lennox farrell, co- chair of the ontario anti-racism advisory council """"anti-semitism exists, but to characterize the show boat issue as anti-semitic is a diversion,"""" farrell said
""""it amazing to me how show boat has come to be seen as an issue of anti-semitism,"""" said angela lee, general manager of the canadian artists network: black artists in action
""""we are accused of being anti-semitic,"""" said farrell, """"but the first person to introduce the issue of black-jewish relations around show boat was garth drabinsky,"""" farrell said
he recounted a meeting he and several other black community leaders held with drabinsky on feb  """"in that meeting, he brought his own jewish background into it,"""" farrell recounted, saying drabinsky told the group that as a jew, he was empathetic to their concerns
for his part, drabinsky says he doesn't recall making any such remarks
""""i certainly don't at all recall having to defend my position as a jew in this whole situation,"""" he said """"i think it has nothing absolutely to do with whether a jew was or was not involved with the creation of the work and to bring it down to that level shows a staggering degree of ignorance it incredible where does it begin and end?
""""you attack jewish producers and jewish creators for god sake, so many black artists will tell you without the jews and their contributions to the arts over the last  years, they wouldn't be working today, they would never have had the opportunities they had in the recording industry, in television, in theatre and film, never, ever""""
but black community leaders like farrell say it a question of power, of who defines what is offensive
""""our humanity is still in doubt, and we have all kinds of people telling us what is good for us,"""" farrell said """"the b'nai brith, united way, the toronto star are all saying show boat is okay
""""is it anti-semitic for a jewish person to come up to me and say that the first two people killed in the civil rights movement in the us were jewish, and that a key anti-apartheid campaigner in south africa was jewish?
""""but if i say 'hey, you're jewish, why the hell are you doing show boat?' i'm anti-semitic
""""but who defines anti-semitism? i assume it is the jewish community that defines that but in the case of show boat, the black community has not been allowed to define what it sees as anti- black,"""" farrell said """"people can't be kicking sand in your face and telling you it sugar""""
""""it shows incredible chutzpah for jews to try to tell blacks what they should find offensive,"""" added carol tator, a prominent member of the jewish community who has worked for  years as a consultant on race relations she also opposes show boat
and tator resists comparisons between the black-jewish relationship in toronto and that in the united states """"because there is such a long and documented history of relations between the two communities in the us, it very much influences perceptions and attitudes of canadians, even though the american experience bears very little resemblance to the canadian experience,"""" tator said
the sense of struggle that blacks and jews shared during the civil rights movement became strained when the movement shifted focus and adopted such slogans as """"black is beautiful"""" in recent years, the wounds have been aggravated by black civil rights leader jesse jackson disparaging """"hymietown"""" reference to new york in  and by the anti-semitic bellicosity of such high-profile black figures as nation of islam leader louis farrakhan
the toronto experience, while inevitably influenced by what is going on in the us, has been different
but jews who would rather not be quoted talk of discussions they've had with black friends, educated, erudite people who nonetheless believe that all jews are rich, powerful and able to influence events those friends, they say, deny outright that there is any such thing as black anti-semitism
and blacks who would rather not be quoted say they get a feeling many jews in toronto simply don't understand what blacks suffer through every day in this city, the kind of discrimination they face, much more persistent and profound than anything facing jews in canada these days
""""is it possible for jews and blacks to be free of the norms and values of a society which doesn't like jews very much and doesn't like blacks very much?"""" tator asked """"the first step in understanding black-jewish relations is being honest with ourselves we are part of a racist culture, in the broadest sense
""""maybe the first step is for us all to begin looking at ourselves a little bit more honestly i think nobody has been blameless, my own community is not so perfect, and neither is the black community,"""" she said

in what is certain to be his last official visit to canada before he leaves the white house, obama turned in a memorable performance wednesday that had politicians and dignitaries packed into a sweltering house of commons repeatedly rising to their feet for standing ovations
prime minister justin trudeau welcomed obama to parliament, """"to our house"""" the prime minister reflected on the history that had been made in the chamber and now, he quipped, """"gets to see a bromance up close""""
in a speech that stretched almost  minutes, obama left little doubt about the warm friendship and common values that exist between canada and the united states
""""we americans can never say it enough we could not ask for a better friend or ally than canada,"""" obama said """"we see ourselves in each other""""
and he lavished praise on trudeau, saying his election as prime minister has brought """"energy and hope,"""" saying canada and the world would continue to benefit even as he said his own time in office draws to a close """"justin is just getting started,"""" he said
and he highlighted issues that have been a priority in the early days close to home for the liberal government
he cheered trudeau's """"powerful message of reconciliation"""" by pledging a new relationship with indigenous peoples
on gender equality, the president said the work is not done until """"all women in our country are truly equal, paid equally, treated equally, given the same opportunities as men; when our girls have the same opportunities as our boys""""
on climate change, he warned that the damning impact is """"no longer an abstraction,"""" a reality that he said was driven home during a visit to the arctic last year
""""it is not an issue we can put off for the future it is happening now it is happening here,"""" obama said """"america and canada are going to need to lead the way""""
he preached a united front against terrorism, the kind that """"reached to the very doorstep of this hall,"""" obama said, citing the attack on parliament hill in 
but he said that must include the muslim community """"they are and must be our partners in this effort,"""" he said to cheers
yet there was a poke with nato leaders, including trudeau, getting set to meet in poland, obama had a message about military funding
""""as your ally and as your friend, let me say that we'll be more secure when every nato member, including canada, contributes its full share to our common security,"""" he said
obama easily wooed his canadian audience but as he prepares to become more involved in the us presidential race, it appears much of it was aimed at americans, too
obama never once uttered donald trump's name
but on trade, immigration, global commerce and international co-operation, the us president gutted the controversial positions advocated by the presumptive republican presidential candidate
""""there are those who offer a politics of us versus them, a politics that scapegoats others - the immigrant, the refugee, someone who seems different than us,"""" obama said
""""we have to call this mentality what it is - a threat to the values that we profess, the values that we seek to defend,"""" said obama, who will make his first campaign appearance with democratic candidate hillary clinton on tuesday
he warned that """"we cannot look the other way"""" when confronted with the plight of refugees
trump declared this week that the north american free trade agreement is a """"disaster"""" and vowed to renegotiate if elected but obama warned that to """"draw a line"""" around a country is no answer
""""restricting trade or giving in to protectionism in this st century economy will not work it will not work,"""" obama said to applause """"we cannot seal ourselves off from the rest of world""""
the us president conceded that frustration over inequality, which he said gave rise to the british referendum vote to leave the european union, cannot be ignored but cautioned that some politicians will attempt to play on those fears
""""and politicians, some sincere and some entirely cynical, will tap that anger and fear, hearkening back to bygone days of order and predictability and national glory, arguing that we must rebuild walls and disengage from a chaotic world or rid ourselves of the supposed ills brought on by immigrants, all in order to regain control of our lives""""
easygoing obama reflected on his inaugural official trip to canada - an ottawa visit in february  - that was his first voyage abroad after winning the election
""""it was colder i was younger,"""" he said to laughs
those present included ontario premier kathleen wynne, quebec premier philippe couillard and rachel notley of alberta actor megan follows, singer nelly furtado and two members of the tragically hip - but not gord downie, who is battling cancer - were also on the invite list
obama had arrived in ottawa from washington mid-morning and headed to the north american leaders' summit where he met with trudeau and mexican president enrique pena nieto
it has been  years since a us president last addressed parliament that was bill clinton
obama's speech referenced famous canadians such as john kenneth galbraith, gordie howe and lester pearson he ended by citing a quote used by pierre trudeau, that a """"country is something that is built every day out of certain basic shared values""""
he took his seat as everyone else in the chambers rose in sustained standing ovation chants of """"four more years"""" left obama with a broad grin on his face

jacob james is running out of dreams first, he wanted to go to the national theatre school
mission accomplished
then, he wanted to be hired at the stratford festival
done and done
appearing on stage with william hutt, who has been called the best canadian actor, was the biggest dream of all
this month, james will fulfil that dream in spades - and just in the nick of time
the -year-old hutt will be making his farewell appearance at stratford as prospero in william shakespeare the tempest and james will be alongside him in the role of ariel, prospero sidekick and servant
the play opens may 
james' admiration for hutt goes back a long way
after james appeared in hamlet when he was , his mother bought him a series of books from stratford two of them were about hutt
a few years later, in , james went on a school trip to stratford with his classmates from kingston collegiate and vocational institute to see the tempest, starring hutt as prospero
at the festival theatre in stratford, there are two actors' entrances in the audience and james was seated above one of them
""""at the end of the show bill is giving his epilogue,"""" james says
""""he saying his last line, 'let your  and then he looks right at me and finishes the line  'indulgence set me free'
""""afterwards i broke away from my group and went to the stage door to meet him i told him that i was in high school and that i wanted to work at stratford one day and i hoped that we would be really good friends""""
last year, six years after that meeting, james was appearing in noises off at stratford and hutt came to see it after the production, hutt visited the cast
""""everyone was crowded around him but i waited until he was leaving and about to get into his big white cadillac i told him about how i'd come up to him before and how i was singing [auditioning] for ariel at the time he said, 'whether we become friends remains to be seen'
""""and now here i am being his last ariel what were the odds of that happening? it such an honour and a gift it makes me pinch myself to see if it real""""
stratford artistic director richard monette had little doubt that james was right for the part
""""he [jacob] came instantly to mind,"""" says monette, who is also directing the play
""""he can move, he has a fantastic speaking voice, a wonderful singing voice and he enthusiastic and positive ariel speeches are extremely complicated linguistically but i know jacob can handle them
""""i would say that this is his coming out party at stratford""""
monette directed hutt last star turn as prospero in , and when hutt said he'd like to do it one more time with monette as director, monette readily agreed to schedule it on this year program
""""the first tempest i ever saw at stratford was with bill as prospero,"""" monette says
""""the second time i played caliban to his prospero the third time i directed him and this is the fourth time so i've always been involved in the tempest with bill hutt""""
and according to the director, the star is happy with james
""""bill is full of praise to me about jacob,"""" monette says
james is trying to be a sponge working with such a celebrated actor
""""he keeps telling me to remember that as long as you're truly communicating with your scene partner, you don't have to push it out to the audience,"""" james says
""""through our connection we'll draw them in i'm not worried about being blown off the stage by him because he an honest, true scene partner for him, it the story that always the most important thing he'll tell me, 'in this case you're driving the scene,' so he'll give up centre stage to a -year-old kid""""
once he got the role, james did his research
""""traditionally they're small guys like me,"""" he says
""""in , bruno gerussi [the late star of the beachcombers] did it with bill, but nicholas pennell was the same size as bill which is quite tall and michael theriault, who did it in , is just a little bigger than me
""""i also learned that there are a lot of biblical references to ariel he many things - an angel and a city there an interesting passage in isaiah  [where ariel is used as a poetic name for jerusalem] which talks about you shall speak from the dust of the earth and speak like a ghost and there are lots of mythical and greek images of ariel as well""""
hutt character, prospero, is a magician who was deposed from his dukedom and marooned on an island for  years
when the men who wronged him happen to come that way, he seeks his revenge
ariel, the fairy, is his agent, causing the shipwreck of prospero enemies in the hope that the magician will set him free from his servitude
""""ariel is a supernatural being consisting of air,"""" james says
""""i'm the wind blowing the leaf and because the character isn't human, that gives me an incredible amount of licence and freedom i'm not bound by the frailties of humanity i'm beyond gender, not a boy or a girl, and so to prepare, i've tried to get in touch with the feminine side of me and find the balance between the both""""
the role requires james to sing three songs he has appeared in musicals at stratford but it was always in a chorus
""""it beautiful music composed by bert carriere who the head of music at stratford,"""" he says
hutt, monette and james represent three different generations of actors at stratford and, in each case, the older actor has tutored the younger
it might be a little early to be mentioning james in the same breath with the other two but monette says that james is one to watch
""""keep your eye on your hometown boy he got a lot of talent and he going to do some good things before he done,"""" he says
james sees the role in cinematic terms
""""bill reminds me of that scene in lord of the rings where bilbo wants to keep the ring and gandalf conjures up that huge magnificent power to persuade him otherwise,"""" he says
""""and even at the age bill is, he can conjure up that power""""
two other kingston actors are also moving up the ladder at stratford
peter van gestel and shane carty play two of the four brothers karamazov in the stage adaptation of the novel by fyodor dostoevsky
the story is about the murder of fyodor karamazov one brother is a disgraced soldier, dmitry, who charged with the crime there the writer ivan, the monk alyosha and the unacknowledged bastard smerdyakov, who worked as his father cook one son is the killer - but he may not be the one charged with the crime

""""history has happened and we have very little freedom to manoeuvre in this,"""" historian michael bliss of the university of toronto said in an interview

""""the issues around getting rid of the border are so profound that we need to do a lot of thinking about it,"""" she said, """"and in particular we need a lot of public consultation""""
for example, it not clear whether mexico would be included in such a security perimeter excluding mexico would raise questions about efforts to improve trade relations, macdonald said
it would be difficult to synchronize immigration policies without also synchronizing foreign policy, she said
""""one very concrete issue would be cuba would canadians be allowed to go to cuba? how would the us treat canadians who had been to cuba?""""
she questioned whether border security can stop terrorism, noting that the united states has not been able to stop the flow of illegal migrants from mexico despite devoting massive resources to border control
canada would also be hard-pressed to maintain its gun control policies if the border were erased, she added
""""it a big problem, but i think the canadian government has to sit down with the us government and figure out what exactly are they asking us to do  and what are going to be the impacts""""
maude barlow, chairwoman of the council of canadians, had rare praise for prime minister jean chretien performance in the crisis
""""i can't believe i'm being supportive of chretien but i actually think he taking the right tack he acting with caution, he an old hand here, he been around the block
""""i think chretien  caution comes from a deep instinct in him not to give up canada and not to give up our own way of reacting to things""""
she said if ottawa agrees to """"erase"""" the border, canada will be seen around the world as having merged with the united states
""""it would be the worst of all worlds we would have no influence over american foreign and economic policy, but we would have to accept fallout from whatever policies they have""""
bliss says canada could erase the border without losing its identity, and he points to the european union as a model
but barlow noted there is no discussion of a new north american governing body like that of the eu in brussels rather, the discussion revolves around canada basically embracing us security policies
""""we're not talking about a joint secure border where we would have equal influence in establishing the conditions and the principles and so on
""""we would just have to live with whatever standards and conditions were set, and whoever is america enemies would be canada enemies""""
there is consensus on one point: free movement of goods and people across the border is vital for canada economic survival
""""if you want to drive canadians toward union with the united states,"""" bliss said, """"the way to do it is get into a mess where border trade is disrupted and our economy is crippled  and people give up on canada""""

Canadians living overseas who hold dual citizenship are being characterized as ingrates for their apparent lack of patriotism, possible tax avoidance, and tenuous cultural and political ties to Canada. If any of this is true, why does it apply only to the more recent wave of return migrants and not to an earlier generation of Canadians living in the United States or England, many with dual citizenship? On balance, Canadians living in the U.S. are seen to bring honour and pride to the motherland through their successful exploits, la Wayne Gretzky, Robert Mundell and Jim Carrey. This sense of pride was not diluted by the possibility of our heroes holding two or more passports. Canadians are forgiving of our icons in the U.S., even when they surrender their prized citizenship.","the evacuation of foreign nationals in lebanon has ignited a debate about canadians living overseas that is useful in some senses, but also misleading
most canadians were surprised to find out that there were as many as , of their fellow citizens living in lebanon, most of whom are lebanese by birth this realization has drawn attention to the recent work of the asia pacific foundation of canada, which puts the number of canadians overseas at around  million
as in lebanon, many of these overseas canadians are recent migrants who have returned to their native countries canadians living overseas who hold dual citizenship are being characterized as ingrates for their apparent lack of patriotism, possible tax avoidance, and tenuous cultural and political ties to canada if any of this is true, why does it apply only to the more recent wave of return migrants and not to an earlier generation of canadians living in the united states or england, many with dual citizenship?
we believe it has to do with preconceived notions of the cost and benefits that the different generations of the canadian diaspora return to canada
on balance, canadians living in the us are seen to bring honour and pride to the motherland through their successful exploits, la wayne gretzky, robert mundell and jim carrey this sense of pride was not diluted by the possibility of our heroes holding two or more passports canadians are forgiving of our icons in the us, even when they surrender their prized citizenship
should we not also cast a similarly positive light on the more recent vintage of foreign-born canadians living overseas? the implications of the lebanon evacuation have much less to do with dual citizenship than with the urgent need for a canadian diaspora strategy that recognizes the transnational reality of modern-day immigration
under the broader rubric of policies to embrace canadians living overseas, there may well be a need to revisit our citizenship and naturalization policy, which is one of the most liberal in the world even so, any tightening of citizenship requirements has to be weighed against the negative effects on immigration and citizenship ascension
it is no surprise that the highest rates of return migration are found among skilled workers, which is the """"preferred"""" class of migrants in current immigration policy the abolition of dual citizenship could well make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled worker immigrants
there are a number of ways in which canada can enhance the benefits of the new diaspora without abandoning dual citizenship the starting point should be to create a stronger link between citizenship and political participation by encouraging new immigrants to vote, whether they are resident in canada or abroad we should emulate countries such as italy, which include overseas nationals in their census and actively encourage them to vote in national elections
encouraging the diaspora to vote is a way of making overseas canadians feel closer to home and keeping them aware of issues in canada
in the same way that we have come to accept that overseas affiliates of canadian corporations are overseas assets that can generate long-term benefits for the country, we need to also count the canadian diaspora as a long-term asset that has to be cultivated, and not spurned

then he took matters into his own hands
desperate and depressed by the theft of his million-dollar fortune, he shot the man who had taken his money and ruined his life
the portuguese immigrant had made his fortune sandwich by sandwich, coffee by coffee, catering truck by catering truck
``all i've done, all my life, is worked and suffered, worked and suffered, suffered, suffered and suffered some more,'' fernandes once wrote former portuguese prime minister anibal cavaco silva in a desperate plea for help
fernandes lost his fortune when he entrusted his money to antonio monteiro, who police say ran a service agency in toronto for a private portuguese bank
for  years, fernandes tried to get banking officials, police and politicians in canada and portugal to help him get his money
then, at : pm on may , , fernandes was driving south on dovercourt rd when his car bumped into another vehicle
it was just a fender-bender but it happened outside a portuguese health-food store duravita, which means long life in latin
the owner of the store was monteiro, who saw the accident, and stood looking out from his window at the man he had swindled
it was too much for fernandes he snapped he ran into the store and shot the man who had ruined him
he fired three shots, and one hit monteiro in the shoulder shocked at what he'd done, fernandes made a desperate attempt to get medical help but as he dragged monteiro out of the store, a police officer, flagged down by an eyewitness, stopped him at gunpoint
monteiro was taken to hospital, where he died  days later of a heart attack triggered by a blood clot
``no one expected him to die,'' a police officer would later testify at fernandes' preliminary trial ``it wasn't considered a life-threatening injury''
monteiro's death, however, may have ended any hope fernandes had of reclaiming his fortune monteiro took to his grave his role in the swindle
``i was almost glad to be arrested because now people would have to listen to me,'' fernandes said in a telephone interview from the don jail, where he's spent  / years awaiting trial
``for  years i couldn't get anybody to help me not the portuguese community not the police not the government nobody''
originally charged with first-degree murder, fernandes, , pleaded guilty to manslaughter last week he is to be sentenced dec 
in the grinding poverty of his azores childhood, jose fernandes quickly learned to work hard as the oldest son in a family of , schooling took a back seat to chores
``my father put me to work as soon as i could walk,'' fernandes wrote in a diary, which also chronicled his obsession with getting his money back
``on those days i was allowed to go to school i had to take a sack of corn to the mill in the morning, and pick up the flour at night then when i came home at night i had to haul wood, draw water, milk the cows, feed the animals''
it was `` uma vida dura e amargosa,'' a hard and bitter life, he recalled
life in the new world could only be better than this ``i had to get out of a life which enslaved the poor''
in , by working at an azores golf course, the -year- old laborer received a rare visa to visit the united states from an american consular official who regularly golfed there
he used it, and overstayed his welcome a year later, denounced as an illegal alien, fernandes made his way north to the canadian border where, with $ in his pocket, he crept across to a new life in canada
he made his way to toronto where, during a year of working at a variety of odd jobs in the city's burgeoning portuguese community, he was able to squirrel away $,
he borrowed another $, to buy a catering truck - the first of the  he'd eventually own
``he worked like a dog,'' his brother jose maria fernandes said ``the one thing he knew how to do was work eighteen, -hour days - that was normal for him''
canny enough to see where the real money was, fernandes sold his fleet and got into the supply end of the business, wholesaling food to the coffee truck industry
``i worked and suffered for  years,'' fernandes would later write in his diary ``the sweat used to pour down my face''
but the money - sometimes $, a week - began pouring in
it wouldn't last
in august, , two masked gunmen burst into his etobicoke apartment late on a tuesday night and, as his young children slept unaware in nearby bedrooms, handcuffed his wife marie, dragged him to another room and pistol-whipped him to within an inch of his life
the gunmen, who demanded he open a safe, fled empty- handed after firing two shots in a futile attempt to cow the catering king
``joe was never the same after that,'' his ex-wife marie gracie said in an interview ``his personality changed he became a completely different person''
the marriage, already in trouble, collapsed a couple of weeks later when gracie moved out with the children fernandes, unnerved by the beating and depressed over the loss of his family, made plans to get out of the rat race that had made him a millionaire
he wanted to buy a house overlooking the ocean in his native portugal's algarve there, jose fernandes expected to find his version of heaven, taking care of his handicapped son, and playing golf while ocean waves broke on the beach below him
it wasn't to be
when antonio monteiro opened a toronto branch of the azores caixa economica faialense, in march of , customers were led to believe they were dealing with an established, private portuguese bank
instead, it was little more than a front counter, taking money from portuguese immigrants and depositing it - unknown to the customers - in ordinary canadian imperial bank of commerce accounts
most of fernandes' money, portuguese prosecutors allege, was then transferred to the private accounts of the bank's president, americo duque neto, a developer who needed cash to finance his construction empire
neto and  other bank officials - including monteiro and two former portuguese cabinet ministers - would later be charged in portugal with fraud in the failure of the bank
ten years later, no one has come trial in portugal, and those charged remain at liberty in a case that has become a national scandal in that country
when fernandes walked into the dundas st w branch of the established portuguese bank pinto & sotto mayor, to ask about transferring money back to portugal, he spoke with the manager, monteiro
wait two weeks, monteiro told him claiming the bank was about to fail, monteiro encouraged fernandes to hold on until he could open a rival branch of caixa economica faialense, which he described as a private portuguese bank based in the azores
so, for the next  months beginning april, , the catering czar made  cash deposits totaling more than $, - paying interest rates of between  and  per cent per year
his first deposit was for $, american and $, canadian with each deposit he would get a receipt from monteiro; about two weeks later confirmation would come from portugal that the money had arrived in lisbon
in november, , fernandes, now seeking to consolidate his wealth in a single account, asked how much more the banker needed to create a single demand deposit of $ million
told to bring $,, fernandes was also told to sign a blank cashier's cheque that, monteiro explained, would enable him to liquidate fernandes' many term deposits and transfer the sums into the single account he sought
nine months later, on aug , , the axe fell
portuguese authorities, citing numerous irregularities and criminal activities on the part of caixa economica faialense directors, shut down the bank and froze its accounts
the toronto branch, as well as branches in nantes, france, and in lisbon had all been operating illegally, the portuguese government claimed caixa economica faialense had no authority to operate outside of the azores
``i have no control over what happens to my money after i deposit it,'' fernandes would later say ``if the bank was operating illegally, that's the government's fault, not mine''
fernandes, worried about his deposits, flew to portugal with monteiro to claim his money, and began a frustrating series of meetings with neto, the suspect bank's head
for two years he accepted neto's personal assurances, guarantees and notarized ious, that his money was safe
instead, portuguese investigators would later find, much of it had long been transferred to the bank president's private accounts in switzerland the rest was used to pay the salaries and office expenses of branch offices in toronto, france and lisbon
satisfied with neto's assurances, fernandes decided not to join a metro group of  caixa economica faialense creditors - a move that would cost him dearly
his money wasn't included in portuguese government guarantees that would later pay depositors  per cent of deposits under $,, and  per cent of anything above that
while , depositors around the world got most of their money back, fernandes, by far the biggest depositor, never saw a penny
portuguese investigators contended that, despite the so- called guarantees, most of fernandes' money was never deposited in the bank's lisbon accounts instead, they say monteiro and neto told them, it constituted a private loan to the bank president
fernandes reacted with outrage
``i never loaned any money to neto i was robbed they lied about it and covered up''
in portugal, during what would become a fruitless five- year odyssey to claim restitution, the man who dreamed of building a mansion on the golf course was reduced to hunting for wayward golf balls and selling them back to the tuck shop for money to eat, and sleeping on park benches
the rage was beginning to boil
``some day i'm going to do something regrettable,'' he told one interviewer a lisbon newspaper would dub him the millionaire of misery
back in toronto in , fernandes found shelter in a friend's auto body shop, sleeping in a van crammed with the last of his worldly possessions
he went around begging for food at local portuguese restaurants, used a garden hose to shower and mixed fruit drinks from crystals in a bucket he carried in the van
``i'm going to search out a place where there are portuguese government workers and take them hostage in exchange for my money,'' he wrote to a friend in lisbon three months before shooting monteiro ``if they don't get me my money, i will kill them and me
``i have no other recourse now that the authorities have abandoned me i can't live any longer in this misery''
he had uttered the same threats to staff at the toronto hospital, where he spent eight weeks in  after an apparent nervous breakdown
psychiatrists diagnosed fernandes as suffering from severe depression but they were helpless to meet his real needs - the return of his money
may , , didn't dawn as a day of retribution but it would quickly turn out that way
after a morning of drinking wine in his body shop refuge, fernandes set out to visit his son paul in mississauga
``i've never seen him that way before,'' said manuel marques, the friend who for two years had provided fernandes with shelter in his auto body shop
``he was crying he was depressed he was inconsolable''
on dovercourt rd just south of dundas, fernandes became entangled in a minor traffic accident outside duravita, monteiro's new store
as he got out of his van to examine the damage, he claims, he looked up to see the former bank manager laughing inside his vitamin shop
``when i saw him in the window, laughing at me, i just lost it,'' fernandes said in one of several telephone interviews from the toronto (don) jail
to this day, fernandes swears he intended only to talk to monteiro
in the argument that followed fernandes fired wildly at monteiro with the  mm russian army pistol he bought in florida years earlier for protection
realizing he'd just shot the one man who could corroborate his tale of financial woe, a stricken fernandes attempted to drag the obese former banker to his van outside
but before he could rush the wounded man to hospital, a police officer summoned by a witness, arrested him
the only statement police got from monteiro was obtained by an officer who accompanied him to the hospital
asked if he knew who had shot him, monteiro answered: ``fernandes he always said he'd kill me''
eighteen months later, jose fernandes still hasn't given up all hope
``my father is a pipe dreamer,'' said his son paul ``he wanted to do lots of things, but  per cent of them never came true
``with part of that money he was going to build me a wheelchair access home he was going to set me up in a business he was going to do this and that''
paul, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says his dad calls him at least three times a day to reassure him that, someday, he'll get his money back
``i've accepted the fact that none of that is ever going to happen,'' paul said
``i've accepted the fact that that money is gone for ever - but he hasn't''

2298081904,The makings of a stronghold: What's the secret to a political 'safe seat'?,Aucun(e) disponible.,"on a sunny saturday morning in ottawa-vanier, carole-ann larose and wayne corneil answered a knock at the door by their local member of parliament
theirs was one of many liberal-leaning households that mona fortier's campaign team visited that day, and the conversation played out amicably, as it does between people who know they're on the same team and share the same goal: to elect a liberal in the riding for the th consecutive time (or th, if you count the years between  and  when it was called """"ottawa east"""")
the riding is a liberal stronghold, widely considered one of the safest grit seats in the country its steadfast vote through historic liberal defeats, member of parliament turnover and changing riding demographics speaks to enduring partisan loyalty where this loyalty comes from is less obvious, despite the fact it's not uncommon
liberal party member of parliament for ottawa-vanier mona fortier speaks with carole-ann larose and wayne corneil while campaigning in ottawa on saturday, august , 
ottawa-vanier is one of many ridings across the country where the same party, and in many cases, the same candidate, receives enough support to take the seat election after election because voting outcomes in these ridings often feel like foregone conclusions, they're easily overlooked in the flurry that surrounds the battleground seats that can make or break governments
but strongholds result from a striking phenomenon - namely, that a plurality of voters, come scandal, inertia or public opinion to the contrary, still decide to stay in long-term relationships with the same political party
the recipe for a """"safe seat"""" isn't simple - if it were, it's likely every party would be out, concocting their own but a deeper look by this newspaper at some local strongholds, and conversations with people who know them well, reveals a common origin story: a close connection between both constituents and their local candidate, and constituents and the party banner under which that candidate is running and if these strongholds are going to break, as many eventually do, it's in these same places that the fault lines may be traced back
back in ottawa-vanier, larose and corneil chatted pharmacare and provincial politics with their mp, and happily accepted fortier's campaign literature and lawn signs
""""you vote, first, for the candidate,"""" said corneil """"mauril bélanger was one of the most outstanding members of parliament he did things even as a backbencher that were incredible mona has tried to carry on that tradition""""
bélanger was the latest in a series of long-serving liberal mps in ottawa-vanier, holding the seat for more than two decades and eight elections before him, jean-robert gauthier was ottawa-vanier's member of parliament from  to  he took over from jean-thomas richard, who'd occupied the seat since 
liberal party candidate for ottawa vanier mauril belanger speaks to supporters at the pineview golf club after winning his riding in the st canadian general election, in ottawa on may , 
incumbency is one of the factors that can explain why a riding continues to elect its representative from the same party, according to stephen white, an assistant professor of political science at carleton university
""""those already in office do have an advantage: they have name recognition  a record, well-developed connections within the local riding so that means, more often than not, the incumbent is the favourite,"""" he said
in addition to enjoying an established reputation, ottawa-vanier's liberal incumbents have also benefitted from the support of an extremely active riding association during his years of involvement, longtime association executive vijay tejuja said they ran regular events in different areas of the riding throughout terms of government, not just around election time
""""one thing which people don't like is showing up during door-knocking, at the time of a campaign, and saying, 'vote for me' because where were you the previous four years?""""
it helps that the ottawa-vanier liberals have a well-financed riding association - its net assets totalled more than $, in  helpful, too, is the fact the riding is located minutes away from parliament hill, making mp face time easier to come by
it's also a riding that's long been liberal at the provincial level when provincial and federal parties of the same stripe enjoy a close relationship, they can share data, double up on organizational resources and collaborate to get things done in their respective ridings
tejuja pointed out this natural working relationship can produce real benefits for constituents - many of whom don't know or care what level of government is technically responsible for dealing with an issue they're concerned about
""""it may not necessarily be a federal issue, but as long as the constituents know that something is being done about it 
vijay tejuja, a liberal party supporter, poses for a photo in ottawa on thursday, august , 
""""you have to be able to reach out for the good of the people,"""" tejuja said
ultimately, he believes it's by prioritizing their constituents that ottawa-vanier's mps have garnered such enduring support
between scoring what many in the riding consider major wins - saving the montfort hospital and opposing a proposed interprovincial bridge over kettle island - bélanger also worked through mountains of individual constituent files, tejuja said, helping solve problems with immigration documents or pensions and when he died in , he was remembered by many as a remarkable constituent champion
fortier, bélanger's successor, boasts her own deep connection to ottawa-vanier voters the former riding association president and lifelong area resident drew a team of  volunteers for her successful byelection campaign in 
clearly, a dedicated constituency mp can go a long way when it comes to building and maintaining riding loyalty to a particular party but in many cases, it's not bulwark enough to guard against the winds of change that can sway constituents' votes
take ottawa centre, which the new democrats held under ed broadbent and then paul dewar between  and the last federal election
""""i don't think anybody in  wanted to fire paul dewar,"""" said kiavash najafi, a former dewar campaign manager who worked for the ndp for more than a decade dewar was a popular local mp, who built a reputation for his dedication to constituents and willingness to work across party lines
cindy lee scott, a constituency assistant in paul dewar's office prepares the election headquarters at chu shing restaurant in ottawa in 
but nationally, the electoral trends were not in his favour najafi does not believe team dewar could have done anything differently to keep the seat orange
""""there was a real sense of excitement and enthusiasm for justin trudeau and his message of real change,"""" najafi said """"the progressive population was coalescing around the best choice to defeat stephen harper""""
dewar lost his seat to liberal catherine mckenna, as did other high-profile new democrats across the country - peggy nash in toronto, jack harris in st john's and megan leslie in halifax - who went down as a liberal wave swept through their ridings
in many cases, it's this sort of sweep election that shifts a riding's longtime loyalty to one party """"suddenly, you just have a wave of popular support and it changes everything,"""" said dennis matthews, a vice-president at communications firm enterprise canada who worked in the pmo under stephen harper
but there are outlier ridings - strongholds that stay strongholds even when the national trends are against them one example is renfrew-nipissing-pembroke, an eastern ontario riding where conservative mp cheryl gallant has consistently outperformed her own party and maintained the seat in every election since 
even in , which saw the conservatives reduced to  seats in the house of commons and a  per cent vote share, gallant retained renfrew-nipissing-pembroke with her sixth election win, and  per cent of the local vote
why has this riding proven so staunchly conservative? the answer, many believe, is an association with the party brand that runs deeper, even, than loyalty to the person running under it
gallant has her supporters, to be sure a visit to the riding found constituents who offered personal praise
""""she's done a good job she's the only politician that's ever written me or called me on the phone in this area,"""" said garry card, who stopped to chat on pembroke's main street
in cobden, another constituent said his conservative allegiance comes from cheryl's work to help his wife take maternity leave
but other riding tories said their vote would go conservative despite, rather than because of, their local member of parliament
""""did you hear her latest remark? about pot causing the carbon tax? holy christ,"""" said pete marcoux, a cobden resident """"but we'll keep voting her in, because there's no other alternative i will not have a liberal in""""
gallant's recent suggestion that smoking cannabis harms the environment is the latest in a long series of controversial incidents that have dogged her tenure in office she's compared abortion to the beheading of an iraq war hostage, and once had to apologize for using a photo of slain soldier nathan cirillo in a fundraising email
conservative incombent cheryl gallant greets supporters on election night in  at the santa fe restaurant in pembroke
gallant did not respond to a request for interview by this newspaper, a habit she has maintained for years but an interview with mike coates, a man who challenged gallant for the local conservative nomination in , offered some insight on her enduring popularity with supporters in the riding
coates campaigned heavily on pledges to work to bring economic growth and job opportunities to the rural region
""""what i found was that there were many people in the riding who were actually more interested in issues of beliefs and values,"""" said coates """"cheryl understood that, and does a very good job of representing those beliefs and values in parliament that helps explain her phenomenal success in the riding""""
gallant has been outspoken on issues of conscience - freedom of religion, firearms rights and sex eduction a look at her voting record shows she opposed cannabis legalization and assisted suicide, while voting in favour of reopening the same-sex marriage debate a scroll through her facebook page also shows a dedication to rural living, with content praising farming, country fairs and communal flood recovery
even among those who don't consider themselves gallant supporters, there's a sense of shared values that guides their conservative vote in election after election
ursula palubiski co-owns the white lake restaurant, a community hub in the tiny village of the same name she reserves a table for the dozen or so locals who consistently show up  minutes before she opens, ready to talk valley politics over coffee her sense is that many renfrew-nipissing-pembroke voters feel more connected to the conservative party and its national brand than they do to gallant
""""they liked harper's no-nonsense kind of approach, they liked the fact that they'd see him with his son at the hockey game, he was kind of a more approachable, down-to-earth kind of guy,"""" she said
""""i think justin trudeau's image is - there's a little rich guy with the nice hair, and he doesn't really care about us because he can't understand what we're living""""
much like a close relationship between riding residents and constituent-focused politicians, strongholds can also be built through a sense of shared values between the electorate in a given riding and the party they consistently choose to represent them
""""it's not like a policy pamphlet, this is stuff that goes deeper for voters,"""" said matthews, the conservative strategist
whether it's age, income, ethnicity or the like, different demographic characteristics can correlate with a vote for a particular party, matthews explained and when a concentration of voters with the same partisan predisposition populate a riding, """"they're almost like a layer on top of the normal shifts that happen from election to election,"""" matthews said
one example? public servants because their livelihoods depend on continued investment in government service delivery, and because there's an association between liberal policy and support for public services, a bureaucrat may well be inclined to vote for a liberal candidate in a riding with a large population of public servants, this could translate into the repeated election of a liberal member of parliament, regardless of national political trends that see the liberal party fall out of favour
likewise, the persistence of a conservative stronghold like renfrew-nipissing-pembroke could be explained, in part, by demographic factors that favour a conservative vote
one particularly salient characteristic associated with voting in a like way is geography
""""people who live in the same areas already tend to share a lot in common,"""" said white, the political science professor at carleton """"if you think about people in large urban centres, they probably share a lot of the same positions on social, economic, political issues with one another people in rural areas probably share a lot of the same positions as one another, too""""
a look down pembroke street
it's no surprise that renfrew-nipissing-pembroke, like many others rural ridings, is a """"safe seat"""" for the conservatives yaroslav baran, former conservative communications director and current partner at earnscliffe strategy group, explained that the association between rural residents and a tory vote is an established one, and it, too, ties back to the values for which canada's political parties have come to stand
canada's federal conservatives have a long association with support for small government and the rights of individuals, baran said """"those values or themes of individualism, or self-reliance, of less reliance on government - that's far more present in rural canada, just as an accident of history and as a fact of life
""""you're not going to have that bus coming down your rural lane every  minutes when you're living in a semi-organized rural township you need to be self-reliant, you need to have your car, you need to have a battery pack and jumper cable in your boot  because if it's not you, there's nobody else to lean on,"""" baran said
contrast that with the urban experience and traditional liberal principles, and it's easy to understand why residing in an urban core can lend itself to a liberal vote
""""the more urban you are, the more naturally predisposed you are to build your lifestyle around one of communal supports and government-provided services,"""" baran said
over the years, party branding has evolved, and so, too, have the types of voters that find themselves reflected in values of a particular party marc-andré bodet, an associate professor of political science at laval university, pointed to one example: the long association between the liberal party and multiculturalism
""""in the early s, the conservatives realized that to actually win a majority of seats, they need to kind of destroy one of the pillars of the liberal party, which was diversity and they've been able to do it, mostly in the suburbs of big cities,"""" said bodet """"this former pillar of the liberal party, which was  if you were born somewhere other than canada, you would vote liberal, this is not as true as it was in the past""""
as party positioning evolves, this can affect party popularity in ridings traditionally considered strongholds
renfrew-nipissing-pembroke wasn't always a safe conservative seat in fact, it was liberal territory from its creation in  to gallant's first election win in 
observers pin much of the reason for this red-blue flip to the transformation of the liberal party brand around that time there was a feeling, said coates, gallant's challenger for the nomination, that the liberals """"stopped representing the interests of rural canada""""
the final straw, according to many - including hector clouthier, the liberal incumbent defeated in the  election - was the liberal government's attempt to create a long-gun registry gallant came out hard against the policy, and this is widely considered the launching point for her reign in the riding
""""that was perhaps the trigger,"""" said coates, """"but it was more emblematic of a broader evolution of the liberal platform which was almost solely focused on urban canada""""
as renfrew-nipissing-pembroke goes to show, political parties bear some responsibility for the maintenance of their strongholds - as well as their loss when a party evolves away from its electorate in the riding
constituencies, though, can also change on their own and if their transformation is significant, it can spell the end of a traditional base of support on which a party might rely
baran pointed out that demographic homogeneity is one of the factors that can explain the existence of strongholds
""""in some cases, it is a linguistic component in other cases, it's a socioeconomic one in other cases, it's more of a cultural one,"""" he said """"when you have a riding that is predominantly cut of the same cloth, it's easier to understand how voting intention would be far more uniform""""
if the population starts changing, and people move in and out of the riding, that can erode the demographic landscape that lent itself to a common vote """"when you have a higher degree of transience in a riding, then there's more of an opportunity for different political or voting cultures to seep in,"""" baran said
in ottawa-vanier, a common explanation for its enduring liberal legacy lies with the large concentration of franco-ontarian voters in the riding, a traditionally liberal-leaning demographic but that population is shrinking, as the area becomes increasingly diverse and if a party ignores changes like this, and does the same thing they've always done to win the seat, that can be a stronghold's undoing
""""a couple of elections have demonstrated that there's no real 'safe seats,'"""" said greg maceachern, a liberal strategist and senior vice-president at proof strategies """"a cookie-cutter approach is not going to work
""""you need to respect the local voices who have worked on campaigns and can tell you, 'look, that type of messaging won't work here,' or 'that type of messaging is exactly what we want'""""
election signs at the junction of richmond road and carling avenue
local liberals in ottawa-vanier are aware their constituency continues to evolve - hence, proactive door-knocking, engaging with different communities during eid or hanukkah, and trying to reflect the diversity that exists in the riding tejuja, an immigrant, uses his own tenure with the riding association as an example
""""if you ever take the electorate for granted, you will be in trouble,"""" he said it's a sentiment fortier also raised, while out door-knocking in the community
""""i know it's been liberal for always, but that's the result - i work as hard as anybody else, i knock on as many doors, if not more, because i don't take that for granted""""
after their doorstep conversation with fortier, staunch liberals larose and corneil revealed that once, when they lived in ottawa centre, the new democrats won their vote
""""it was what was needed at the time, it still felt fresh and new,"""" said larose that was years ago, but both admit it's possible they could stray once more from the liberal party - if, say, it stopped nominating candidates in ottawa-vanier who are deeply connected to their constituents, as they say both fortier and her predecessors have proven to be
it's a conversation that underscores the fact that even the safest of seats are comprised of voters with free will and if one of the factors that can foster a stronghold starts to falter - a hardworking, constituency-focused mp, a connection to the principles the party stands for, or a demographic makeup that's friendly to a particular party - that stronghold can fall
""""think of a battlefield,"""" said bodet, the professor at laval """"you're becoming less and less in a position of control, and then suddenly you realize your advantage is gone""""

2222837676,Local promoter believes new fee misunderstood,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the impact of a new fee to be imposed on foreign musicians
will likely have little impact on the kingston scene, a local
concert promoter believes
the $ fee announced by the federal government earlier this month
by jason kenney, minister of employment, social development and
multiculturalism, is for a labour market opinion, or lmo,
application that is required when hiring international workers
that fee is in addition to $ for a work permit for the duration
of the tour
bars, pubs and restaurants will have to pay for them to play, while
theatres, concert halls and festivals are exempt
for example, the grand theatre would not have to pay the fee, but
the ale house in the hub would
since being reported by the media, the fee has become the ire of
musicians and promoters alike
marc garniss, operator of kpp concerts, feels many people
misunderstand the fee
""""i think people are overreacting on this a little bit, in my
opinion,"""" he said """"i think people have a few misconceptions about
it""""
for one thing, the majority of acts from the united states would
rarely play just a single show in canada, and, if booked by the same
promoter, the $ fee would only be charged once and its cost could
be spread out over the duration of the tour, garniss said
there are a number of exemptions, too, such as booking a band for a
room that is exclusively for live music
""""i do the majority of my shows in the living room at the mansion,
and it's only ever open for bands up there,"""" said garniss, who
figures he has booked  to  us-based bands
he also books shows at the time to laugh comedy club, which, under
federal rules, is also an exempt location
most american bands who do play in kingston do so as part of a
tour, garniss said, often sandwiched between dates in toronto,
ottawa and montreal
it's the booking agent who usually has to pay the fee and that
sometimes is spread among the different promoters
even in the worst-case scenario -- in which an american band comes
to canada to play just a single show in a bar -- promoters should be
able to put on the show provided the band has a big name
""""odds are they should be a big enough band where, yes, if you have
to pay the $, for the one show, that's, through ticket cost, a
recoupable expense,"""" garniss said
if the $ fee existed a decade ago, chris morris -- the former
owner and operator of rock crew productions -- doesn't think he
would have been able to bring former rolling stones guitarist mick
taylor to kingston in 
now a real estate agent, morris hasn't taken the time to read the
current legislation, but he's glad the lmo fee didn't exist back in
his booking days or it could have been prohibitive for his business
""""i could think of a pretty good handful of american acts that i
brought in that i just wouldn't have been able to bring in,"""" he
said
morris, who had brought in a number of american hip-hop acts such
as  live crew and dj jazzy jeff, feels that it would have been
difficult to absorb those fees through ticket prices and still make
a profit
""""at the time, there probably would have been no hip-hop in
kingston,"""" he said
morris also thinks the job-protection aspect of the fee is
unnecessary in most cases
""""in principle, i see what they're doing, in the broad spectrum of
making it more expensive to hire temporary foreign workers,"""" he
said, """"but there's a difference for musicians""""

At one point, [Hillary Clinton] was so fed up with the coverage about her that she told a Washington Post reporter that the """"incredible vitriol"""" from """"misogynists"""" was rarely discussed, compared with the amount of coverage about racism. former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro wrote last week in the Boston Globe that neither the [Obama] campaign nor the media """"understand what is at the heart of the anger on the part of women who feel that Hillary Clinton was treated unfairly because she is a woman.""""","early last month, when many supporters of barack obama werebraying for hillary clinton to give up her bid to win the us democratic presidential nomination, i wrote that one reason she should stay in the race was because she was carrying the hopes and dreams of millions of women who saw her as a trailblazer, the woman with the best chance ever to become president
the response i received was huge what shocked me, though, was the vehemence of some readers who spewed vicious, sexist insults about hillary
now that it is obvious to everyone except maybe hillary that obama will be the democratic nominee, analysts are weighing in on how she lost what once looked like a sure thing for her
she campaigned as if expecting a coronation, some pundits contend; she didn't campaign on change like obama did; she went negative against obama too soon; she was washington old school; she suffered from lingering voter backlash against her husband bill
all have some validity
but at the heart of hillary's loss was overt sexism, which manifested itself in how she was treated throughout the campaign
and before smug canadians too quickly dismiss this notion as a us phenomenon, think again because sexism in politics is probably stronger here than in america
true, in hillary's case it is often difficult to separate who she is as a political figure from the fact that she is a woman her record is well-known, both good and bad, including a screw-up on the health-care file that bill gave her while they were in the white house
but the reality that she is bright and capable didn't stop some voters and volatile tv commentators who like to stick it to women """"who get too big for their britches"""" from branding her """"a bitch"""" to suggesting she should be ironing shirts instead of running for president
at one point, hillary was so fed up with the coverage about her that she told a washington post reporter that the """"incredible vitriol"""" from """"misogynists"""" was rarely discussed, compared with the amount of coverage about racism
and former democratic vice-presidential candidate geraldine ferraro wrote last week in the boston globe that neither the obama campaign nor the media """"understand what is at the heart of the anger on the part of women who feel that hillary clinton was treated unfairly because she is a woman""""
ferraro said tens of thousands of women """"feel that if society can allow sexism to impact a woman's candidacy to deny her the presidency, it sends a direct signal that sexism is okay in all of society""""
the truth is that women are treated unfairly in politics the bar for performance is set higher for them than for men and the media focus on weakness in candidates rather than strengths and, curiously, somehow manage to find more in women than in men
some pundits reject such views as sour grapes get over it, they say sure, politics is unfair for women, but it's also unfair for hispanics, blacks, immigrants and others
but, as ferraro says, denigrating the messenger won't help find ways to deal with the problem
sadly, sexism is also strong in canada indeed, our record of electing female politicians is far worse than in the us for example, there are many female state governors, yet only one woman has ever been elected premier in a canadian province in a general election
stumped?
the answer is catherine callbeck in prince edward island in 
countless canadian women politicians have suffered from sexist attacks similar to what hillary endured kim campbell, who led the federal tories to a humiliating defeat in , faced withering media criticism for cavorting with her boyfriend while on the campaign trail former liberal deputy prime minister sheila copps was once called """"baby"""" in the commons
did hillary lose the race solely because of sexism? impossible to say for certain, but few can doubt that it deeply affected her chances
in the aftermath of hillary's campaign, the challenge both in the us and canada is to find ways to combat sexism, possibly through education programs or, as in hillary's case, by having experienced women run strong campaigns that change the course of politics
if hillary's campaign can at least accomplish that, then she will have truly been a trailblazer

2608802813,"Bye bye bipoc:   Some are anxious to keep up with the terminology to signal support for anti-racism, but it's a problem when they do so without paying attention to the nuance of those terms",Aucun(e) disponible.,"who on earth is a bipoc person?
bipoc is an acronym that has flared into public consciousness since the  summer of protests against police brutality against black people it stands for black, indigenous, people of colour and was quickly pronounced bye-pock
i thought it held some promise then it appeared to be a thoughtful political coalition term, acknowledging disparate impacts of white supremacy by singling out black and indigenous experiences, even though both """"black"""" and """"indigenous"""" are homogenizing identities in themselves, and not always disparate
when it comes to police brutality, we're not all in it together black and indigenous people are treated more unjustly than just about anyone else in our criminal justice system other people are treated with disdain, but that contempt often stems from anti-black, colonial ideas of refinement and race
however, as with poc or person of colour, bipoc got swallowed up, quickly lost nuance and got spat out at a racial identifier to say """"not white""""
colonized lands that grapple with human rights face a perpetual puzzle: what to name """"the other"""" without saying """"the other?"""" it has led to a long-standing tension on this continent, a tension between a racial identity and a political one, a tension between the labels white people want to apply versus how people identify themselves
in canada that desire for euphemistic framing has translated into various terms over the years """"coloured,"""" """"minority,"""" """"diverse"""" they bunch into one box people held together by the most tenuous of all connections, that of not being of european origin
words matter, and they are tricky they swim in the sociological waters around them, meaning one thing at one point in time and something else the next
those sociological realities have now claimed the term bipoc like they do other racial designations that are rooted not just in history but also prejudice
i had never been called """"east indian"""" until i came to canada if anything i identified as south indian, as in one who lived in the southern part of the country then i began to be called south asian, another label i'd never heard before it instantly flattened the vast diversity of all the nations on the indian subcontinent into one homogeneous lump, but at least it was a geographical descriptor
i then came across another widely used term: poc, or person of colour it sounded a bit like """"coloured people,"""" which i didn't know then was a slur i assumed it simply referred to the fact of melanin in my skin
poc became more of a political identity over time when it bonded me with those who experienced similar responses to our non-european origins, including east asians in other words, when i underwent the process of racialization or the process of being forced to see that i was categorized as a certain """"race"""" and feel its impacts this, even though race itself is anthropological fiction, constructed as a tool of exploitation
early s us state laws defined a person of colour as one with some """"negro blood,"""" but in contemporary canada at least, the term poc erased black experiences and kept invisible indigenous ones the grassroots advocacy for change came from those groups, but its biggest beneficiaries have always been white women, followed by other people of colour
when the fight for civil rights in the us led to the creation of """"affirmative action"""" laws - or a push for corporations and universities to end discrimination - white women over decades received a far higher share of managerial jobs and degrees
poc was supposed to be a collaborative term but even when reduced to an identity, it was more positive than non-white, which sounded like a deficit, an accusation of something lacking
it was also better than the revolting """"visible minority,"""" which made no sense visible to whom? how does it account for those that might be """"invisible"""" but still in the margins, such as first nations, métis and inuit?
there is also an irony in naming a global majority a """"minority,"""" but more than that, colonization globally has showed that numerical domination has nothing to do with power
in a city like toronto where the presence of """"visible minorities"""" causes white flight, statistics showing that it is populated by a visible """"majority"""" causes white fright, and spawns far-right white grievance ideologies in the rest of the country
words are not the solution, but yes, they matter
that's why i heard alarm bells ringing when a corporate executive said bipoc stats had gone up in their staff demographics, but a closer look revealed there were no indigenous hires
emails from publicists began routinely throwing up lines like these: bipoc founder behind (xyz) coffee shop bipoc sommelier breaks barriers on wine's role
at a discussion on online harassment, a white woman described another woman at the receiving end of abuse saying, """"and she's bye-pawk she's bye-pawk""""
how does an individual become bipoc?
in that moment i realized i'd gone from being indian to being south asian to be a person of colour to now being either black or indigenous and a person of colour in the span of a few years, my identity had been diluted beyond recognition this absolute homogenization is the opposite of what the term bipoc was meant to do
it's true that some people are simply anxious to keep up with the terminology to signal support for anti-racism, but when they do so without paying attention to the nuance of those terms, and flatten our identities and conflate the unique struggles of different groups, they replicate the problem the terminology is trying to eradicate
i am done bye, bye bipoc
in my work i opt to use individuals' own preference for identities and describe backgrounds as specifically as i can i've also deliberately used non-white, not as a racial identity, but to emphasize experiences of people who are penalized for not being white
i quite like the term """"racialized"""" although plenty of people of colour have not awoken to their own racialization and plenty of white people have i realize that """"racialized,"""" too, is used as another word for """"not white"""" but like """"marginalized"""" - an even bigger umbrella term - it at least insists on being seen as a process
several months ago, npr journalist gene demby referenced the linguistic term """"euphemism treadmill"""" on the podcast code switch it's a term that refers to polite words, softer words used to replace those that might give offence but over time, these euphemisms become toxic by association and themselves need to be replaced demby pointed to words such as oriental, coloured or negro that were all proper terms at some point
""""the terminology can only stay ahead of the negative attitudes for only so long,"""" he said presciently """"the problem is not the language we use to refer to people the problem is the attitude we have when referring to those people""""

it would be comforting to watch their polite handshakes and handsome smiles and conclude that they represent some kind of all- canadian rapprochement they do not
the reality is that the reform party nurtures crude hostility toward quebec and quebecers in the west to thrive as the political party of the cantankerous in turn, the bloc quebecois points to occasional bigotry and general anti-quebec grumpiness in the west to nurture political insecurity and a feeling of victimization at home

grey attacks the other federal parties for their """"obsession with distinct society and special status for quebec"""" she pronounces the province's name, kwee-beck, which is grassroot lingo for hades the angry people in the crowd cheer like crazy
the reformer beams in reply during the question period, a man shouts that quebec separatists should be shipped out of canada and replaced by grateful immigrants another man says he's sick and tired of canada pandering to separatists in kweebeck
when a disgusted edmontonian objects to what he sees as reform's racism, grey snaps that she won't put up with that kind of nonsense from him, or anyone else, certainly not from """"any potlicker"""" in parliament
yet never once does grey stand up on her two feet and say to reform supporters in the audience: """"you're wrong about those quebecers i sit beside bloc quebecois mps in the house and they have as much right to speak their minds in canada as you or me don't be so hateful the reform party does not stand for hate"""" never once

a few weeks after the vote, i meet maroes again to talk about the election over a pizza lunch she says she never did find time to look at that ad she couldn't be bothered this is rapprochement? this is shared vision of a renewed federation, mr manning?

Nobody was promoting hatred toward any identifiable group, which is a damn sight more than can be said for many religious factions that are openly and unapologetically homophobic. Not, oh no, that the show queer factor had anything to do with these objections from the Hindu religious leaders. They are quite specific about that. And we must take them at their word, although they won't take the word of ACT officials that no disrespect was intended, or that they have apologized sincerely for their benign ignorance. It has become common to whinge about the """"appropriation of culture,"""" as if we should all speak only in the voice to which we can formally lay claim.

Or, equally troubling, that """"outsiders"""" can cross the boundaries only when the content of their work is vetted and deemed satisfactory.

more provocatively still, there have been numerous schlock horror films made wherein the crucifix denotes something sinister or, even worse, when it used as a luridly pornographic prop remember what linda blair did with a crucifix in the exorcist?
the catholic church - as primary custodian of the crucifix - may not like the sacrilegious purposes to which it has been subjected but the vatican has long since stopped making a fuss about it
there is no patent on the cross
it not often that i can point to the catholic church and say follow their example as in lighten up, back off, and turn the other cheek
but it would behoove toronto hindu community - or at least some of their most overtly aggrieved leaders - to climb down from the wounded and truculent posture they have assumed since a charity fashion event last month so offended their religious sensibilities
the fashion cares bollywood cowboy show - and i've no idea what bollywood has to do with cowboys since the genres would seem to be worlds apart - was sponsored by the aids committee of toronto, a firmly established good-works agency their sin was to commit an inadvertent fashion crime, dipping into the symbology of hinduism to illustrate the show cultural motif
elements of the presentation included a nearly nude depiction of the goddess lakshmi as well as drag queens who, goodness me, were smoking and drinking whilst in costume as various other deities in the vast hindu firmament further, postcards of divine characters were trampled underfoot where patrons had carelessly dropped them

it did no such thing and few sensible people - beyond societies where zealots go around smacking citizens in the head for exhibiting any hint of vice or non-pious behaviour - could possibly argue that a populist democracy need be so extremely diversity-sensitive that the religious observances of any particular creed should be imposed on secular activities
it was a fashion show, for heaven sake nobody was promoting hatred toward any identifiable group, which is a damn sight more than can be said for many religious factions that are openly and unapologetically homophobic not, oh no, that the show queer factor had anything to do with these objections from the hindu religious leaders they are quite specific about that and we must take them at their word, although they won't take the word of act officials that no disrespect was intended, or that they have apologized sincerely for their benign ignorance
one spiritual leader from the vishnu hindu temple in richmond hill even went so far as to make what can only be described as a threat, as if act - and by extension the gay community - has not had quite enough of those

in the process of respecting all cultures, faiths and races - a noble endeavour - we have increasingly diluted the central tenets of our own canadian ethos; that this is a country of free expression, even when that expression causes hurt feelings we cannot all live up to the threshold of approval and sensitivity as determined by others, particularly special interest groups whose grievance radar is so finely tuned to all perceived injury
it has become common to whinge about the """"appropriation of culture,"""" as if we should all speak only in the voice to which we can formally lay claim this implies an exclusionary form of ownership, as if only hindus can utilize hindu symbols, only catholics can paint the madonna, only black women can write novels about black female characters, only jamaicans can play reggae music or, equally troubling, that """"outsiders"""" can cross the boundaries only when the content of their work is vetted and deemed satisfactory this is madness
there is such a thing as the public domain, to say nothing of artistic expression, which is actually a great big something while i'm no fashionista and have some difficulty including the rag trade among the arts, even i recognize that designers have always plundered other cultures to create a theme or a trend or a look indeed, the bollywood/indian mysticism motif is hardly new

he drew cheers, applause and nazi-style salutes at an enthusiastic rally in a rome movie-house
the crowd went wild as le pen shouted out the buzz words of his national front platform - """"family,"""" """"homeland,"""" """"values"""" - and condemned its enemies: """"communism,"""" """"materialism,"""" """"barbarians,"""" """"socialism""""
""""i am a european and ours will be a common destiny,"""" he said """"either we die together or we save ourselves together""""
msi leader gianfranco fini, a thin, bespectacled man in his s who took over as party secretary less than a year ago, presented le pen with an honorary membership card and basked in the reflected glory
but the applause for fini was not negotiable at the polls despite alarming reports of an upsurge of italian racism, msi suffered a serious setback in local elections last weekend
although it is italy's fourth largest party (behind the christian democrats, communists and socialists), msi won only  per cent of the vote, down sharply both from the  per cent it captured in national general elections last year, and the  per cent it won in local elections in 
""""fini is not le pen,"""" said the rome daily il messaggero
the election losses were a major blow, coming just a week after the deaths of the party's longtime leader giorgio almirante and party co-founder pino romualdi the vote also underlined an identity crisis in msi, and italy's extreme right wing in general
natural causes
almirante, who had served as party secretary for  years before handing over the post to fini, and romualdi died of natural causes within hours of each other
both in their s, they were fascist supporters of dictator benito mussolini each benefitted from an amnesty after world war ii and helped found msi to keep the fascist flame burning
their double funeral, in rome's historic piazza navona, drew crowds of party faithful - including squads of young toughs who hailed the coffins with raised-arm, nazi salutes
the two men's direct links back to mussolini, as well as almirante's charisma, gave the party its unique character as a historic relic with virtually no power on the national level
""""now, one has to ask whether, with this generation out of the scene, the msi is destined to lose its identity and force of attraction (in electoral terms) or instead whether it is now more free to give itself a modern face,"""" wrote commentator orazio petracca in the newspaper corriere della sera
petracca said the party could turn its back on fascist nostalgia to become a part of the mainstream democratic right or it could become even more extremist than it is now it could become even subversive: right-wing extremists outside the msi umbrella staged several bloody terrorist attacks over the past  years and plotted to overthrow the government
there are also fears that the kind of racist policies espoused by le pen - he wants to rid france of third world immigrants - will flourish here
the concern that the italian right - and the msi in particular - might start playing the racist card to win support has been implicit in the high-profile media reporting about an apparent recent upsurge in racism in italy
for the most part, incidents have been ugly - but relatively minor:
* prominent jews have received hate mail and anti-semitic slogans have been scrawled on city walls;
* a black african woman was insulted and forced to give up her seat on a bus;
* a teenage boy was beaten up by masked youths in a town near venice because he was from the south
better life
but many italians remember racial persecution under mussolini  years ago, and rome's chief rabbi elio toaff has warned several times in recent weeks that anti-semitic and other racist incidents today are reminiscent of fascist times
""""numerous incidents reveal there is also the risk that ethnic intolerance will spread, with the extreme right ready to ride the wave of the le pen effect,"""" noted the newsmagazine l'espresso
over the past few years, italy has become a mecca for third world immigrants seeking jobs and a better life - or visas to canada, the united states and australia
with more than a million third world immigrants estimated in the country - as many as , of them illegally - italy is confronting the realities of a multi-racial society, including racial prejudice, for the first time
the country has long prided itself on being open to foreigners, with an especially lenient policy toward refugees
that's why so many italians were shocked when a recent survey of teenagers in rome revealed that most of them would approve the closing of italy's borders to foreign immigrants

1036929561,Real fireworks will come after vote,"On the Liberal watch, the Quebec government held an extensive public consultation to seek a balance between accommodation of the province's cultural minorities and the maintenance of a coherent collective identity - and then lost interest in tackling the issue.","  quebecers looking to cast a vote for social peace next tuesday are in for a disappointment that precious commodity is not on the election ballot this year
the hangover of an unresolved student crisis awaits the winner on the morning after the election depending on tuesday's results, that headache could get worse before it gets better
if the parti quebecois wins next week, pauline marois's first act as premier-elect will be to cancel the tuition hike that has pitted the student movement against premier jean charest
but unless the pq secures a majority, it might have a hard time selling a hostile national assembly on what the liberals and the coalition avenir quebec see as an act of capitulation
under any scenario other than a pq victory, the province's cegeps and universities could be hit by a new wave of class boycotts before the week is up but the student uprising is only the tip of an iceberg of coming clashes between the next government, regardless of which party leads it, and various sections of quebec's civil society
in every other provincial election held in the past  months, voters reluctant to rock the boat at a time of economic uncertainty re-elected the incumbent but in this instance in quebec, continuity is anything but a guarantee of stability
it is not clear why liberal leader jean charest thought that an election could dispel the clouds that have accumulated over his three-term government
the notion that a liberal mandate - renewed by a minority of voters - would restore his government's moral authority smacks of deathbed thinking, especially against the backdrop of a public inquiry into corruption
if the polls are right, charest will leave his troubles behind on tuesday but only because his party will be banished from office
as for the pq, it would spend the peace dividend it would buy by giving the student movement what it wants on marois's identity agenda
from the language law to quebec's approach to religious and cultural diversity, there is not an identity-related pandora's box that a pq government does not plan to reopen
for the pq, success is ultimately measured on the scale of the support for sovereignty on the list of potentially unifying events, another referendum on quebec's future probably comes dead last
if the caq wins next week, the current lull in street demonstrations could be the last quiet time for a while
from teachers to doctors and government corporations, there are few public sector constituencies that caq leader francois legault is not vowing to take on
his proposals would put a rookie government on a straight collision course with some of the most combative unions in the country
when all is said and done, a lot of neglected liberal chickens will be coming home to roost in quebec after tuesday's vote
almost a decade ago, charest came to office determined to re-engineer the so-called quebec model his ambitions then were not that different from legault's but he lost the stomach for that fight before his first mandate was up
on the liberal watch, the quebec government held an extensive public consultation to seek a balance between accommodation of the province's cultural minorities and the maintenance of a coherent collective identity - and then lost interest in tackling the issue
the liberal premier never managed to transform the capital of canadian goodwill that presided over his election at the head of a federalist government to improve the terms of the relationship between quebec and the rest of the country
a final thought: by this time next week, quebec may have followed ontario's footsteps and put its fate into the hands of a fragile minority government
it would be unprecedented to have simultaneous minority governments in canada's two largest provinces
it is also hard to think of another time when quebec and ontario have both been tackling different but equally contentious agendas
the uncharted waters ahead are choppy ones and they will make waves beyond the confines of central canada

that makes it all the more painful to watch the fuss that is playing out in quebec over muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa that veil their faces and bodies while a tiny minority dresses this way, those who do draw a disproportionate - and unjustifiable - share of intolerant attention
in a keystone kops spectacle that should make canadians cringe, a quebec """"francization"""" official chased down naema ahmed as she wrote a french exam in a montreal immigrant centre on tuesday and told her to remove her veil or leave she left, in tears

this wasn't ahmed's first clash with the authorities last year she chose to leave saint-laurent community college following complaints that she was causing friction by wearing a veil and keeping her distance from male students there, too, it was lose the veil or go

what's the pressing need to require women to uncover their faces, absent some compelling reason of public safety or identification? who was ahmed threatening? she was a student, not a teacher she was trying to integrate into quebec society, in her own way if she ever learns french she'll be able to communicate better with the people around her so will her kids
the claim by officials that ahmed's face must be visible to correct her pronunciation, is risible is it better to force her out of class?
the sad truth is, ahmed is a pawn in a nasty identity debate

blair is a legal expert on indigenous issues, the author of the inspector ramirez mystery novels and a realtor she had worked as an election observer in the  orange revolution presidential election in ukraine and was feeling shocked and powerless as the war unfolded
a few weeks ago, she mused on twitter that she had space for some asylum seekers in her home west of ottawa, but no idea how to find candidates then she added her email address
the message found its way to a young ukrainian woman named sasha who had fled to warsaw, poland, with her mother and was looking for a host family in a city with a large ukrainian population through her network, blair found a host in edmonton
the email continued to make the rounds soon blair was building a database of volunteer hosts and matching them with ukrainians looking for a place to stay she started out by placing asylum seekers in other canadian cities, but there have recently been requests both from ukrainians and hosts for ottawa placements
""""it's matchmaking you have to fit in a whole bunch of variables languages spoken, expectations on both sides,"""" blair said """"i always want to ring a bell when i place a family""""
in one case, a grandmother and granddaughter were looking for a host family they don't speak english or french - but do speak italian
blair found a potential italian-speaking match, but the family had to back out after learning that the pair were bringing a dog because their children have allergies blair is back on the hunt for another italian-speaking host
social media has made the job easier when one ukrainian family found a barrhaven townhouse for rent, it took only days to crowdsource donations to furnish it, from a dining room set to a fridge full of food
""""i'm like an air traffic controller,"""" blair said """"when i go on social media and say, 'i need x, y and z,'i get it when i get one problem solved, it's on to the next problem""""
many of the asylum seekers have lacked the money for a flight to canada the cost from warsaw is about $, but the average monthly salary in ukraine is about $, blair said many of those who want to come to canada can't afford rent until they can find jobs
the canadian government's approach has streamlined things the canada-ukraine authorization for emergency travel is aimed at allowing ukrainians and their family members come to canada as quickly as possible, with permission to work and study while they are here
the accelerated temporary residence program has allowed blair to be """"quicker and more nimble, she said because the ukrainians are not legally classified as refugees, they don't require sponsorship instead of looking for apartments, which are expensive and require references, they can start out with a host family
on the other hand, while refugees have their health-care covered, this is not currently true of the ukrainians - although some provinces have announced they will be making an exception
earlier this month, ontario premier doug ford said an estimated , ukrainians are expected to arrive in ontario and they will get immediate coverage under ohip
some of blair's hosts are canadians of ukrainian descent """"some are just people who have been horrified at what they are seeing,"""" said blair, who is approached by new ukrainian families every few days and has about  potential hosts in her database

because it's the only thing i can do""""
anastasiia korol, an -year-old fashion design student and artist, and her mother ludmila, , are currently still in their hometown of kyiv they contacted blair after hearing about her through a source in poland blair has already matched them with a host in orléans with connections to the arts scene
anastasiia said she spent the first three days of the war in shock
""""i didn't see the point in anything i didn't want to draw but i pulled myself together and finally picked up my pencils i tried to sell my art in ukraine, but our people have a crisis now and can't buy any products that they don't need""""
for now, kyiv is safe, but there are always sirens and the fear of bombardment, she said the korols hope to set out soon for warsaw by train and then to canada after they receive their security clearances
""""it's not difficult to get a train, because there are not as many people as in the beginning we have a website where we can buy tickets, however, these tickets run out quickly,"""" she said
blair was looking to match three young women, a group of friends who recently graduated from law school
bruce may, a retired military lawyer and sandra west, a retired military physician, have agreed to host two of three the couple's daughters no longer live at home, and they had two spare bedrooms their friends tom and nicolette kovesi, who live minutes away, will host the third woman
""""they are adults starting out their lives,"""" west said """"in december, they were living their own lives in their own country they had their future taken away from them""""
mayo and west had a zoom meeting with their three guests last saturday two of the women are now in germany, while the third is in tbilisi, georgia if all goes according to expectations, they will be in ottawa by early may
mayo and west say they both grew up understanding the threat of a russian invasion bruce was stationed in lahr, germany, from  to  and his father was in the air force west served in afghanistan
""""this is what we talked about all those years the soviet union fell, but russia just continued,"""" said mayo
""""we're concerned for these people,"""" tom kovesi said """"not only is it incredible expensive here, but we don't know if things will sort themselves out in a month or a year""""
kovesi, a pediatric respirologist at cheo, said the call for hosts reminded him of stories he heard from his parents joseph and vera, hungarian refugees who arrived in ottawa in  before he was born
when the hungarian refugees arrived at cfb uplands late in december and were invited to christmas dinner at the officer's mess
""""there was a pyramid of oranges
my mother had not seen an orange since prewar hungary,"""" kovesi said """"she asked if she could have one, and she was told she could have them all""""
a call went out for hosts for the new arrivals the senior kovesis would later recall a line of car lights as far as the eye could see, all volunteer hosts nicolette kovesi's mother, who was also a hungarian refugee, was housed with a mother with a newborn baby from the netherlands who welcomed the newcomer to her one-bedroom apartment
""""people were unbelievably generous,"""" kovesi said his parents lived in a series of apartments in the byward market and bought their own home in alta vista in  his father owned rudy's tailoring on bank street, which became a hub for immigrants
""""we have space for someone,"""" he said """"we really feel that it's time to pay back""""
as for blair, some of the success she has had in making connections is because of the twitter followers she gained during the """"freedom convoy"""" over a series of parody tweets called """"dearest martha"""" (a popular example post: """"dearest martha, we lost the bouncy castles and hot tub yesterday to enemy forces we used our shovels to build a mighty snow wall to hold back the intruders, but i fear they have a snow blower pray for us"""") blair had only a few thousand followers on twitter before convoy, but that increased to , afterwards that has helped to spread the word
a colleague in kingston has contacted blair in the hopes of starting a similar project blair hopes others will take the template and run with it
""""i didn't know anything when i started once they get it rolling, they can handle it the heavy lifting is in the beginning,"""" said blair, who posts what she has learned on her real estate blog, kiss and sell """"i don't mind being the pivot point at the centre""""
between jan  and april , almost , ukrainian citizens have arrived in canada, according to immigration, refugees and citizenship canada figures
almost , applications were received for the temporary residency program and , were approved between march  and april  more announcements are expected soon, including charter flights for those waiting to come to canada
a spokeswoman for ircc said it's impossible to say how many ukrainians will arrive and when """"there is no limit to the number of visas or work or study permits that ircc can issue,"""" she said

Bill C-54 would not only have denied effective representation for growing urban areas of Ontario, but also would have denied, in the words of the Supreme Court in the Carter ruling, """"minority representation (that) may need to be taken into account to ensure legislative assemblies effectively represent the diversity of our social mosaic.""""","controversial legislation to redistribute seats in parliamentfell by the wayside when prime minister stephen harper called a federal election last month but a re-elected conservative government would almost certainly revive it and that's bad news for ontario and its large population of visible minorities who will be casting their ballots today
the harper government's bill c- would have given british columbia and alberta another five and four seats respectively after the  census that would make their representation in ottawa roughly proportional to their share of the national population
but ontario would have ended up with just  per cent of the seats in parliament even though the province is home to  per cent of the population as rudyard griffiths, co-founder of the dominion institute, has calculated, this would effectively disenfranchise some  million ontarians, or approximately one of every  citizens of voting age
according to griffiths, ontario's  million immigrants, the majority of whom are visible minorities who have arrived in the past five years, would be the most affected
all this is reminiscent of the situation in george orwell's classic novel animal farm, in which some animals were more equal than others after they overthrew farmer jones napoleon, the pig leader in animal farm, would have been impressed by the result
he also would have approved of the suitably orwellian comments of peter van loan, a conservative mp from ontario and tory house leader in the last parliament, who had the temerity to call ontario premier dalton mcguinty """"the small man of confederation"""" for opposing the bill
the conservative government responded to the howls of protest from the liberal government of ontario and the federal liberal party by saying the province was getting  more seats and should stop complaining about the  other seats it is entitled to based on population the conservatives said it would mean expanding the federal parliament by  to  seats - too much bother!
try telling that to the unequal voters of southern ontario in fast-growing cities like kitchener-waterloo, hamilton, brampton, oakville and toronto try convincing the , voters of willowdale who go to the polls to elect one mp that their votes are as equal as those of the , voters of palliser, sask, who also get to vote for one mp
indeed, the gross lack of effective representation that would have resulted from bill c- may well have called into question its constitutional validity the supreme court in attorney-general of saskatchewan v roger carter ruled that while section  of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms does not guarantee total equality of voting power, it does guarantee the right to """"effective representation,""""
the court continued """"relative parity of voting power is a prime condition of effective representation deviations from absolute voting parity, however, may be justified on the grounds of practical impossibility or the provision of more effective representation factors like geography, community history, community interests and minority representation may need to be taken into account to ensure our legislative assemblies effectively represent the diversity of our social mosaic beyond this, dilution of one citizen's vote as compared with another's should not be countenanced""""
while the ruling could justify smaller populations for rural ridings, the court also clearly stated that effective representation must also increase the number of seats to reflect population increases in urban areas
bill c- would not only have denied effective representation for growing urban areas of ontario, but also would have denied, in the words of the supreme court in the carter ruling, """"minority representation (that) may need to be taken into account to ensure legislative assemblies effectively represent the diversity of our social mosaic""""
there is expert proof of this in a study by michael pal and sujit choudhry in their paper published by the institute for research on public policy (irpp) titled is every ballot equal? visible minority dilution in canada
pal and choudhry stressed that the visible minority vote is diluted across canada, especially in british columbia, alberta and ontario
within a decade, one in three citizens in ontario will be visible minorities, the majority living in ridings that would have been negatively affected by bill c- that could be grounds for a constitutional challenge to future redistribution legislation based on section  (), the equality guarantee of the charter
we might well ask if bill c- was a deliberate attempt to dilute the votes of visible minorities in the vote-rich areas of southern ontario
if that was the case, then not only was the bill in violation of sections  and () of the charter and, therefore, unconstitutional, it also was a despicable attempt to undermine the democratic foundations of this country
should any attempt be made to revive this pernicious legislation, it should be vigorously opposed in the courts and by the vast majority of citizens of canada in ontario

this doesn't mean that all the others (actually, fewer than  in all because several served twice) are forgotten
wilfrid laurier will always be admired for his elegance and eloquence mackenzie king always gets a high rating for leading canada through the transition from an agricultural society to an urbanized, industrial one and for creating a modern civil service
lester pearson will never be forgotten for his achievements in peacekeeping, with the maple leaf flag, and, far from least, for winning the nobel peace prize even if john diefenbaker disappointed, a memory endures that he stirred up a somnolent country and dared to challenge it with a northern vision
macdonald and trudeau, though, stand apart from the rest both, in a certain sense, are still alive both still stir emotions, of all kinds admiration and anger, love and hate, respect and condemnation we are interested in both and feel strongly about both
each is that canadian rarity - a hero each is also, to quite a few canadians, a villain; macdonald for executing louis riel, trudeau for imposing the war measures act
about trudeau, the finest insight about him was that observation by authors christina mccall and stephen clarkson """"he haunts us still""""
of macdonald, it could be said """"he taunts us still"""" every good portrait of him captures the amused, sardonic look with which he gazes outward while calculating how to manipulate and seduce anyone watching into becoming a conservative
there are parallels between their careers each lost just one election and then was returned to office at the first available opportunity by an electorate relieved to get their hero/villain back
neither could be fitted into the formula of a typical canadian with trudeau, this was more obvious he always seemed as if he would be happier talking to some incomprehensible european intellectual, or to a silent buddhist monk than to any actual canadian
macdonald broke an even more important canadian rule he had no interest in pretending to be respectable and proper he not only drank but he did so openly and unapologetically, once putting down a heckler by saying - quite correctly - that voters preferred, """"john a drunk to george brown sober""""
there were parallels in their policies
the purpose of each was to build canada for trudeau, this meant patriation of the constitution and the charter of rights and freedoms, bilingualism and multiculturalism
for macdonald, this meant confederation itself, and afterwards the national policy of high tariffs to foster manufacturing, creating the northwest mounted police (today, the rcmp) and, above all, his impossible dream of a transcontinental railway
besides building canada, both were determined to save it trudeau's life-long mission was to ensure that quebec did not leave canada macdonald's equivalent was to make certain that americans did not take over canada, or - an equal threat as he saw it - that canadians did not slip southward by reaching for cross-border free trade before confederation had, in his phrase, """"hardened from gristle into bone""""
of the pair, time has actually been kinder to macdonald than to trudeau both were widely loved in their day and the funerals of both were occasions for national mourning
trudeau, though, remains a controversial figure in contemporary terms while macdonald stirs kindlier thoughts and a readiness now to revel in his humour and his humanity (academic historians do tend to be censorious about him)
macdonald's birthday - the evidence is unclear whether it actually was on jan  or jan - will be celebrated this weekend in places as far apart as his hometown of kingston and vancouver
after writing this piece i will go down to hamilton to talk to a group now staging its third annual event, while a fellow biographer, charlotte gray, will be doing the same in orillia
elsewhere, quite a few individuals across the country will, on the th or the th, raise a glass to macdonald more of us ought to do the same for trudeau; except, of course, he drank very little

240136360,Calgary Declaration full of falsehoods:   [FINAL Edition ],"So we are offered a ``framework'' for public consultation, listing several ``ways to strengthen the federation'' on which the nine premiers and two territorial leaders claim to be agreed. These may, or may not, take the form of constitutional changes, depending on which premier you talk to; the list, moreover, may be amended, added to or ignored as each province sees fit. The premiers have unanimously agreed, it would appear, to do whatever they like. Usually this lack of substantive accord is papered over with a clutch of unassailable platitudes. What is remarkable about the present exercise is that even the truisms are false. ``All Canadians are equal,'' it begins, ``and have equal rights protected by law.'' This is plainly a lie. You have only to look at Section 15 of the Charter of Rights, which begins by proclaiming that ``every individual is equal before and under the law,'' and ends by upholding laws that discriminate against some individuals in order to help others. The Supreme Court, to make matters worse, has interpreted even the first part to mean that everyone is equal, so long as they do not belong to a ``historically advantaged'' group. That province is Quebec. For that matter, there is only one province that has embarked upon a systematic campaign of suppression against a particular language group; that forbids parents to educate their children in that language; that has banned, and still restricts, the public display of that language, all in flagrant violation of the doctrine of equal rights to which the premiers pretend to subscribe. That province, too, is Quebec.","  andrew coyne is a national affairs columnist for southam news his e-mail is acoyne@southamca
the premiers are honourable men they desire the good how, then, could they have crafted such an obvious forgery as the calgary declaration, a document whose every line breathes a falsehood? because they are convinced they are saving the country and because they believe that to save the country they must bamboozle its people
so we are offered a ``framework'' for public consultation, listing several ``ways to strengthen the federation'' on which the nine premiers and two territorial leaders claim to be agreed these may, or may not, take the form of constitutional changes, depending on which premier you talk to; the list, moreover, may be amended, added to or ignored as each province sees fit the premiers have unanimously agreed, it would appear, to do whatever they like
it is difficult to know what else they have agreed to, so deliberately vague is the framework's intent nothing new there: skilled practitioners of the art of the possible know that it is better to agree on nothing than to disagree on something
usually this lack of substantive accord is papered over with a clutch of unassailable platitudes what is remarkable about the present exercise is that even the truisms are false ``all canadians are equal,'' it begins, ``and have equal rights protected by law'' this is plainly a lie you have only to look at section  of the charter of rights, which begins by proclaiming that ``every individual is equal before and under the law,'' and ends by upholding laws that discriminate against some individuals in order to help others the supreme court, to make matters worse, has interpreted even the first part to mean that everyone is equal, so long as they do not belong to a ``historically advantaged'' group
``all provinces,'' the premiers go on, ``while diverse in their characteristics, have equality of status'' this, too, is a lie
there is only one province that collects its own taxes, that runs its own pension plan, that selects its own immigrants
that province is quebec for that matter, there is only one province that has embarked upon a systematic campaign of suppression against a particular language group; that forbids parents to educate their children in that language; that has banned, and still restricts, the public display of that language, all in flagrant violation of the doctrine of equal rights to which the premiers pretend to subscribe that province, too, is quebec
let us skip lightly, then, past the next two items on the premiers' list, lofty hymns to canada's diversity, tolerance, compassion and equality of opportunity, and get to the meat of the matter
``in canada's federal system, where respect for diversity and equality underlie unity,'' the premiers declare, ``the unique character of quebec society, including its french-speaking majority, its culture and its tradition of civil law, is fundamental to the well-being of canada''
furthermore, ``the legislature and government of quebec have a role to protect and develop the unique character of quebec society within canada''
there are many things this windy passage might mean we should begin by understanding what is not intended by it it is not, however many times we have been told it is, simply a ``recognition'' of quebec, a symbolic affirmation, a statement of reality the explicit intent of its most fervent advocates, from the federal government to the quebec liberal party to the editorial board of the globe and mail, is that it should be an interpretive clause in the constitution -- that is, that it should guide the courts in applying the constitution, and so by degrees change the constitution as the jurisprudence evolves
if you think quebec enjoys too high a degree of autonomy now, if you are alarmed at the state of minority rights in the province today, you should know that the effect of this clause, if not its purpose, is to give the government of quebec still more legal wiggle room with which to advance its nationalist ambitions
it is not too much of a stretch, for example, to see it being used to justify the intrusion of quebec into the regulation of broadcasting, the better to limit the number of english-language stations
federal intergovernmental affairs minister stephane dion has recently suggested that ``its culture'' might include the caisse de depot, whose curious investment practices might therefore be transformed from a particularly devious form of internal trade barrier into just another manifestation of quebec's unique character and if the caisse qualifies, what doesn't?
but suppose it is merely a political statement, without legal effect what exactly are we saying to quebec? we are saying: carry on as before we have no objection if you impose differential fees on students from out of province; if you refuse, contrary to the canada health act, to pay the full cost of medical treatment obtained outside the province; if you discriminate against non-francophones in immigration policy -- it is all fine with us
i suspect the premiers will find, in the course of their consultations, that it is not fine with canadians but then, that's never stopped them before

however, let's not be too smug canada and some loud, bigoted and hateful canadians have engaged in some of the most vituperative, hateful and disgusting forms of islamophobia over the last six months that has rocked me to my very core
it was only eight short weeks ago that an islamophobe sauntered into a mosque in quebec city and, with both casualness and purpose, shot to death six muslim canadians at prayer while wounding five others
in the aftermath of the terror much comfort was said and done, but today this horrible massacre may as well have occurred decades ago
it was only two weeks after the quebec city shootings that hundreds rallied under the banner of rebel media, canada's offensive breitbart north, at an evangelical church to ostensibly decry the rise of islam in canada referred to as a """"freedom rally"""" seemingly objecting to motion  (a parliamentary motion condemning islamophobia and all forms of racial and religious discrimination now passed in house of commons) as an attack on free speech
with large pickets proclaiming """"say no to islam"""" and poisonous rhetoric exclaiming """"islam is evil"""" and """"mohammed was a pedophile,"""" it was more a vile islamophobic mob rant
weeks later, torontonians were witness to a number of anti-muslim rallies targeting downtown mosques that strangely brought together fringes of the jewish community, specifically the jewish defence league, with white nationalists in the guise of the soldiers of oden they, along with others, loudly and provocatively instigated hate and have created a climate of fear in the muslim community
and only a couple weeks ago, we saw the spectre of a small phalanx of parents whose children attend the peel region school board loudly condemning the board's very correct decision to allow space for muslim students to pray once per day
during the meeting, shameful epithets were shouted against canadian muslims the meeting ended with a frenetic individual loudly shouting his hateful bile while publicly ripping to shreds the qur'an, islam's holy book
all this from a canada many refuse to see or acknowledge yes, school board trustees stood gallantly against hatred, local politicians harshly criticized the haters, but is that enough?
while motion  passed parliament, the schism it produced has hurt us all how is it possible that, according to angus-reid polling, fully  per cent of canadians opposed support for the motion, including the leadership of my own jewish community?
how is it possible that this same leadership - which advocated only two years earlier for a similar motion opposing anti-semitism, who understand what it means to be hated because of their faith - would deny the very same protections they rightly demanded for themselves?
and most importantly, why the silence and cowardice in the face of hatred toward our fellow canadians?
it is time that more than just a few activists, journalists and politicians speak out
we must break the silence of immorality it is time that all the leaders of canada's great faith communities - from the roman catholic archdiocese to the anglican church of canada from the united church to the board of rabbis from canadian hindu temples to buddhist and mormon leaders and so many more - speak out, forcefully and in unison they must speak out with courage and conviction in defence of the vulnerable canadian muslim community
the great philosopher and nobel laureate elie wiesel once said, """"we must always take sides neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented""""

during those years, they settled in ottawa they learned english and french, got married, got jobs, and had their daughter, who is automatically a canadian citizen
but poland made some pretty dramatic progress of its own -- it embraced democracy and communism collapsed so did the basis for their refugee claim
when they were told they would have to leave canada, their plight won the support of friends, strangers and ottawa politicians the immigration department was unmoved and immigration minister bernard valcourt refused a last-ditch plea to grant them landed-immigrant status on humanitarian grounds

but their fight, led by ottawa west liberal mp marlene catterall, continued supporters deluged valcourt's and the prime minister's office with phone calls lawyers argued on their behalf the couple applied again for landed-immigrant status -- it was granted in august
travel visas were issued in september and this month, the couple spent all the money they had, borrowing from family and friends to make the third ,-kilometre trip this time they arrived with about as much money as before, but with two extra suitcases
""""we will have to do everything again from the very beginning, with one exception,"""" said zujewski """"we know more than before, we have experience

on the other hand, graves says, terrorism is the """"lead image"""" canadians envision when they think of security and when asked to make choices that pit security against civil liberties, canadians """"dramatically and consistently by a large margin"""" choose the former
""""which is somewhat odd,"""" he says, """"given that they don't tend to rate the actual risk levels as that high""""
why don't they?
it helps ease the mind, certainly, that canada is not fighting extremists in iraq; it helps ease the mind, certainly, that our country is nicknamed the great white north and not the great satan
and perhaps canadians are more truthful about their fears and non-fears than americans - some of whom may view """"alarm"""" over terrorism as a badge of conservative-hawk honour
""""i think if you asked canadians an honest question on whether they feel threatened, they'll tell you from their hearts and not what political card they carry whereas in the states, it a label,"""" says ipsos reid senior vice president john wright, author of what canadians think about almost everything """"it embodies a question of patriotism and political support it not just a question""""
perhaps canadians - who are not usually named in al jazeera harangues, who have not had a sept , whose country iranian mullahs have not honoured with an annual hatred holiday - are able to be more rational about terrorism than beleaguered americans
it not like we're ignoring the threat, right? two-thirds of us, according to a may ses research poll, think canada participation in the war in afghanistan makes us more vulnerable to a terrorist attack
but we aren't freaking out, either
""""here an interesting stat,"""" says graves """"about one in  americans, and sometimes it gets up to one in , think they personally will experience a terror event like sept """" for all of them to be right, he says, """"there would have to have been a sept  every single day since sept  the distortion is so egregious that it almost unimaginable""""
we're not only calmer, however, than americans
in april and may of , according to an international pew poll,  per cent of canadians were concerned about islamic extremism a lower percentage than in germany ( per cent), spain ( per cent), the netherlands ( per cent), france ( per cent), the us ( per cent), and (pre-/) great britain ( per cent)
spain, of course, had already suffered the madrid train bombings; the netherlands had been roiled by an islamic extremist murder of filmmaker theo van gogh, who had made a movie protesting radical muslims' treatment of women; french secularists were fighting high-profile battles with muslims over, among other things, the hijab and radical mosques canada had not experienced anything comparable
but even immediately after the  arrest of  purported members of a """"homegrown"""" islamist terrorist cell,  per cent of canadian respondents to an ipsos poll believed """"the arrests represented an isolated group of fanatical individuals"""" and were """"not indicative of the existence of other potential terrorist groups in canada""""
according to the canadian security intelligence service, there are more terrorist groups in canada than in any country in the world other than the us
perhaps canadians are in denial
""""it denial,"""" says david harris, a former csis chief of strategic planning and now a senior fellow with the anti-islamist canadian coalition for democracies """"and it blossoms from there""""
canadians, harris says, don't understand the """"ideology of global jihad"""" or the """"the nature, extent or scope of the physical threat"""" we don't understand that muslim extremists hate our live-and-let-live values and want to destroy our society
and we don't understand that, even though the vast majority of immigrants and refugees from islamic countries are """"wonderful people,"""" the sheer number we receive guarantees that some will be extremists
""""if you do the numbers and do a modest extrapolation,"""" he says, """"we will meet and exceed anything that happening in britain and france in due course""""
and, perhaps, we won't
""""i don't think anybody would argue that our risk is comparable to britain,"""" says professor wesley wark, who studies security and intelligence at the university of toronto munk centre for international studies
our muslim population, wark says, is far less radical; extremist imams don't abound in our mosques and prisons; an attack on canada, a non-superpower without a history of imperialism, would not be as attractive to groups like al qaeda
the threat of terrorism, wark says, is """"very real; it could visit canada, and we have to take appropriate responses"""" but - fortunately? unfortunately? - he says it tougher to assess the threat posed to canada than the threat posed to other nations
""""it a very difficult notion it can happen here, but it might not this is the kind of dilemma that many european countries, many middle eastern countries, south asian countries, and the us don't have to face they can be much more certain about the nature of the threat we can't be in this country we can't embrace it as a kind of pessimistic certainty
""""we,"""" wark says, """"are stuck somewhere in between""""

2686763332,Unfinished business: how we might best honour Irving Abella:   He taught us about Canadian values. But modern-day racism shows we still have work to do,Aucun(e) disponible.,"""""none is too many"""" was the kind of book most historians could only dream of writing it's not that the profession discourages the publication of accessible writing, but that monographs tend, by definition, to not be suitable for mass consumption for such a book to become an overnight sensation, one that forces a nation to challenge its most basic assumptions, is essentially unheard of
that the same book would become """"an ethical yardstick against which contemporaneous government policies are gauged,"""" and that it would further serve to change - correct, you might say - government policy, makes """"none is too many"""" all the more remarkable
written by harold troper and irving abella (who died july  after a long illness), """"none is too many"""" demonstrated, unequivocally, that canada was not the welcoming land of refuge many thought it was, and that canadian government officials largely refused european jews' entry into canada during the nazi period because many officials held anti-semitic beliefs
vincent massey, at the time a high-ranking diplomat in the mackenzie king government, objected to jewish immigration because he believed jews would bring communism to canada and yet, after the war, thousands of nazi collaborators and other assorted war criminals were permitted to immigrate to canada because their war records demonstrated they were reliably anti-communist
it is tempting to believe that we are not this way anymore for a time at least, canada did turn its back on its xenophobic immigration policies """"none is too many"""" played a key role in this respect, as an advance copy of some of the book's chapters was sent to then-immigration minister ron atkey in the middle of the vietnamese refugee crisis
though attitudes toward refugees and immigration in general were already changing for the better, atkey still faced considerable pressure, both in government and from the public at large, to refuse these refugees entry into canada """"none is too many"""" helped convince atkey to not repeat the mistakes of the past, and canada took in , refugees from cambodia, laos and vietnam, the highest per capita of any of the receiving nations
reflecting on the th anniversary of """"none is too many"""" in , irving abella lamented that xenophobia and racism were on the rise, and that the nazi war criminals canada accepted after the war continued living their lives in peace and comfort though most, if not all, of those men have likely died in the last nine years, canada's xenophobic and racist tendencies have not only grown but are becoming normalized
there has been a proliferation of dangerous far-right groups across the country hate crimes, particularly of the anti-semitic, islamophobic and anti-asian variety, are on the rise nationwide more insidiously, the anti-immigrant, anti-refugee rhetoric of the far-right fringe has trickled down into the cesspool of canadian politics
this manifests in several distinct ways, across the political spectrum whether it's the overtly xenophobic people's party of canada, regular references to refugees as """"queue-jumpers"""" by conservative politicians, or the trudeau government's deportation of more than , asylum-seekers during the pandemic, canada is moving away from its own ideal
consider as well that the quebec government has passed blatantly discriminatory laws that unfairly target immigrants, and canada's three major federal parties, all of whom allegedly support multiculturalism, have remained largely silent françois legault can say publicly that he opposes multiculturalism, a statement seemingly more at home in the quebec of the s than today
and it's not just the normalization of xenophobia that has developed into a worrying trend, so, too, is the ongoing sanitizing of the nazi collaborators and war criminals who found refuge in canada after the war when someone painted """"nazi war monument"""" on a cenotaph dedicated to the waffen-ss in an oakville cemetery two years ago, police initiated a hate-crime investigation
a bust of the ukrainian war criminal roman shukhevych outside an edmonton cultural centre received a $, grant from the trudeau government to help secure it against hate crimes and an ottawa monument intended to honour the victims of communism received donations for commemorative stones that honoured known and suspected war criminals, nazi collaborators and various fascist organizations
that the department of national defence pathetically claimed it was under no obligation to be certain of the backgrounds of the ukrainian far-right extremists they were training recently, even though many of them had swastika tattoos, is unfortunately demonstrative that, just when you think the country has hit rock bottom, it can always stoop lower
when irving abella served his term as president of the canadian jewish congress in the mid-s, he made it his top priority to lobby the canadian government to more thoroughly investigate the war criminals canada admitted unfortunately, the government has only ever dragged its heels in this regard we would be wise to pick up the torch and renew the pressure throwing a spotlight on this sordid history would, much like """"none is too many"""" did nearly  years ago, challenge our basic assumptions about who we are as a nation, and force us to deal with the reality of our history, and not the comfortable fiction we've invented with any luck, such an effort may bring about substantive and progressive growth
there's reason to be optimistic: in the day following abella's death, amazon's stock of """"none is too many"""" wasnearly depleted

2621519678,Baby among four frozen bodies found near U.S. border:   Human-smuggling charge laid in 'heartbreaking tragedy',Aucun(e) disponible.,"a florida man has been charged with human smuggling as authorities investigate the deaths of four people, including a baby, who were found some  metres away from the canada-us border in manitoba
the discovery of the bodies marked a tragic ending to a case of irregular immigration that officials, it was revealed thursday, believe is part of a larger human-smuggling operation from canada to the us - in a part of the continent more accustomed to migrants travelling the other way
the events began with a group of at least nine indian nationals, all speaking gujarati, being dropped off near emerson, man, on tuesday night during a blizzard, according to court documents
by the next day, seven had been taken into custody south of the border, along with the american allegedly meant to pick them up on the us side, while four had died, apparently from exposure to the cold, on the canadian side of the border
us authorities said border patrol officials stopped a -passenger rental van wednesday driven by steve shand with two undocumented indian nationals inside, less than a mile south of the border in a rural area between lancaster, minn, and pembina, nd shand and the indian nationals were arrested
officials also intercepted another group of five indian nationals nearby who were walking in the direction of where the van was located, according to the court documents
""""they appeared to be headed to an unstaffed gas plant located in st vincent, minnesota the five indian nationals explained that they had walked across the border expecting to be picked up by someone the group estimated they had been walking around for over  hours,"""" the us district attorney's office in minnesota said in a statement thursday
a couple of the foreign nationals had sustained serious injuries and were brought to hospital, with one likely requiring partial amputation of a hand from frostbite
five were found wearing identical black winter clothing, including winter coats, black gloves, black balaclavas and insulated rubber boots shand had matching gloves and a matching balaclava also
""""one of the group members was in possession of a backpack that did not belong to him he stated he was carrying the backpack for a family of four indian nationals that had earlier walked with his group but had become separated during the night,"""" the news release went on """"the backpack contained children's clothes, a diaper, toys and some children's medication""""
us officials said the bodies found in canada were tentatively identified as the family of four that had been separated from the others
shand, , appeared in court thursday and was remanded in custody
rcmp assistant commissioner jane maclatchy called the incident """"an absolute and heartbreaking tragedy""""
""""we're very concerned  that these individuals, including an infant, were left on their own in a blizzard when the weather hovered around - c,"""" she told a news conference that occurred before shand's court appearance
""""you'll also note that i'm using the term victims - and that's on purpose""""
maclatchy said police were working on identifying the people who had died, and their nationalities
emerson is a small community of about  people bordering both north dakota to the southwest, and minnesota to the southeast, with the two states separated by the red river there is an official border crossing with pembina, but there is no official crossing with the minnesota side
southern manitoba had been under an extreme weather warning, with winds up to  km/h, according to residents
an interview with one of the arrested indian nationals, meanwhile, described in a complaint filed in minnesota district court against shand, shed some light on that person's apparent plans
""""one of the indian nationals provided limited information to border patrol he reported that he paid a significant amount of money to enter canada from india under a fraudulently obtained student visa,"""" reads an affidavit by john stanley, a special agent with the us department of homeland security """"he did not intend to study in canada, but rather to illegally enter the united states""""
the affidavit said an investigation into """"a larger human smuggling operation of which shand is suspected of being a part"""" is ongoing, as well as the investigation into the deaths of the four individuals found in canada
border patrol agents had suspected recent smuggling events after finding footprints in the snow, and rcmp agents had discovered an abandoned backpack with a price tag in rupees, indian currency, around the same time
until the pandemic, canada had seen a surge of asylum seekers entering the country from the us through unguarded border crossings, driven by then-us president donald trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants
between  and september , there were , irregular border crossers intercepted by canadian officials who made refugee claims in canada, including , who came after the pandemic hit in march , when ottawa banned them from crossing into the country for asylum
however, experts say it's rare for irregular migrants to travel the opposite direction, trying to sneak into the us
""""we've seen that with asylum seekers bound for canada this is the first time we're hearing about people who were on their way to the united states it's a little hard to fathom why that would be the case,"""" said queen's university immigration law professor sharry aiken
""""it doesn't mean that it doesn't happen we do know that there's a much larger population of undocumented in the us and that it's generally easier to survive there as an undocumented person than it is in canada""""
someone would have reached the end of the line in canada in their attempts to seek status here or had family connections south of the border to take the reverse trip, aiken speculated
in december , two ghanaians, seidu mohammed and razak iyal, survived the treacherous journey through hip-deep snow and biting cold, crossing from north dakota to manitoba via emerson for asylum in canada the former lost most of his fingers after nearly freezing to death
robert beninger, a longtime emerson resident and elected member of the local urban district committee, said residents have become accustomed to interacting with irregular migrants who come up from minnesota, where the highway ends just south of the canadian border, with farmer's fields on either side
""""for a while there, we were refugee centre-plus they would come and knock on somebody's door and we would call the rcmp and try to get them somewhere safe,"""" he said
beringer said it is fairly common for people to be """"dumped"""" kilometres away from the border, and that they would be cold by the time they reached canada
""""they were dropping them too far away,"""" he said of those past instances """"it's just terrible""""
according to a report from reuters,  people crossed the border irregularly into emerson from the us in the first two months of , at a time when refugee agencies reported higher-than-usual rates of migration to canada because of trump's crackdowns
the reeve for the municipality of emerson-franklin, dave carlson, said the tragedy had rattled him and the others he's spoken to
""""they were found  kilometres east of emerson - that's a far more remote area  it's farm fields,"""" he said
""""there's no real shelter, not a lot of landmarks and in poor visibility and extreme wind chills a very dangerous place to be
""""(we're) trying to understand how someone is that desperate to get out of canada - and to risk it by doing it in extreme weather in a remote area,"""" carlson said """"i just hope nobody else tries this, especially in weather that can kill you""""

437367330,"Vote is our last chance: Parizeau Premier appeals for preservation of language, birth of country:   [Final Edition ]","QUEBEC - Officially pressing the button for an Oct. 30 referendum, Premier Jacques Parizeau has warned it may be Quebec's last chance to become a country and save French as the language of its people. Parizeau indicated the sensitive issues of language and immigration - as well as the ``dangers'' for pensions and other social security benefits if Quebec were to remain within Canada - will be at the heart of the campaign. ``Now we have a second chance,'' Parizeau said toward the end of last night's television address as he recalled how Quebecers failed to give a majority to the late PQ Premier Rene Levesque's sovereignty-association referendum in May, 1980.","quebec - officially pressing the button for an oct  referendum, premier jacques parizeau has warned it may be quebec's last chance to become a country and save french as the language of its people
parizeau indicated the sensitive issues of language and immigration - as well as the ``dangers'' for pensions and other social security benefits if quebec were to remain within canada - will be at the heart of the campaign
``now we have a second chance,'' parizeau said toward the end of last night's television address as he recalled how quebecers failed to give a majority to the late pq premier rene levesque's sovereignty-association referendum in may, 
``not many peoples get a second chance,'' he warned
``none can predict the future, but it is possible that oct  will be our last collective rendezvous then, from being a `province like the others,' we will perhaps become individuals like the others,'' he said
in his -minute televised address to quebecers and an earlier encounter with the media, the parti quebecois premier expressed confidence the sovereignists can win
``i think we'll make it,'' he told reporters after meeting with his six top cabinet ministers at the historic cataraqui estate to issue the referendum writ
``i think we'll have a country pretty soon''
the question quebecers will vote on oct  is: ``do you agree that quebec should become sovereign, after having made a formal offer to canada for a new economic and political partnership, within the scope of the bill respecting the future of quebec and of the agreement signed on june , ?''
the june  deal outlines the common political and economic institutions to be included in the offer and was signed by the parizeau, bloc quebecois leader lucien bouchard and action democratique du quebec leader mario dumont
parizeau continued to practically ignore liberal leader daniel johnson, the official head of the no forces, and concentrate his fire on prime minister jean chretien, ``the real boss'' of the federalist camp, he said
parizeau said the choice for quebecers is between running their own affairs or having ``others'' run them
parizeau said chretien is responsible - as a former cabinet minister under pierre trudeau - for ``the federalist debt'' that threatens quebecers' future quality of life
``the head of the no camp, mr daniel johnson, explained it very well himself: the federal debt was created in chunks of $-billion a year essentially because people like jean chretien meddled in our affairs and spent, on credit, money which nobody had
``today, it can't go on so, in ottawa, mr chretien says: `we must cut' it's true, it's inevitable, but cut where? choices have to be made''
parizeau said chretien has admitted in the commons that ``if we vote no, we will be subjected to their choice of cutting the pensions of new pensioners - and when will those of existing pensioners be cut?''
ottawa has cut unemployment insurance for women and young people and ``imposed on quebec the biggest budget cuts in our history,'' he added
``on the one hand, they cut the funding for health, day care and post-secondary education and, on the other hand, they use our tax money to build luxury megaprojects such as (the) hibernia (offshore oil project) in newfoundland and a billion- dollar bridge to prince edward island''
these, said parizeau, were ``their choices - choices which escape us, as quebecers it is decided in ottawa where we are, more and more, a minority
``if we vote yes, on the other hand, it will become possible to make our own choices on how we will manage things if it is yes, we have already made a choice: to protect present and future pensions at their present levels that is our choice''
an independent quebec, which would manage the $ billion in taxes quebecers now send to ottawa along with the additional $ billion the sovereignists say they would economize by eliminating overlapping jurisdictions, would make different choices, he said
``couldn't we decide to reduce the generous handouts to billionaire companies?'' he asked
``couldn't we decide that the taxes on the profits of big companies would no longer disappear into strange tax havens?''
parizeau said the french language is in good shape in most of quebec, but is threatened in montreal
``in  years, the majority of montrealers will no longer be francophones,'' he said
``as a province, quebec has run out of solutions and so, if we vote no, we will be condemned to look on, without being able to do anything, while french declines in our biggest city
``but, if it's yes, it becomes possible to control our immigration policy completely above all, if it's yes, our future immigrants will know that they are coming to a distinct country, distinct by its language and its culture that will make quite a difference in their attitude and in our own''
and parizeau raised the spectre of quebec as a province finding i tself without any bargaining power if it votes no
``we must decide whether or not to tell our neighbors and the entire world that we exist if we vote no on oct , we are telling them: `you were right to deny our existence, you were right to reject our demands' if we vote no, we deprive ourselves of any future bargaining power''
some of these themes are apparent in the yes side's new billboard campaign that was launched yesterday throughout the province
posters of varying colors - yellow, orange, green - used the o in the word oui (yes) as the vehicle for a variety of messages with the words ``with a yes, it becomes possible'' at the bottom
in one poster, the o contains the canadian loonie dollar coin - meaning a sovereign quebec would keep the present currency
others include a pictogram of a man at work (jobs), the anti- nuclear symbol (peace), a map of north america (quebec in the world) and a daisy, an anti-violence message
parizeau's two sovereignist partners - bouchard and dumont - were on hand with him yesterday for a strategy meeting and will play a major role in the yes side strategy, yes organizers say
today, bouchard and parizeau meet the media together after a ceremony at quebec city hall before the bloc leader returns to ottawa for question period in the commons

mr namouh, appeared for just several seconds in quebec court after being transported from his home in the mauricie region, northeast of montreal, where he was arrested wednesday night
crown prosecutor pierre labelle was tight-lipped about the case, saying only that the investigation is continuing and that the charge involves a plot to detonate a car bomb
mr namouh doesn't face any terrorism charges, mr labelle said
he is to return to court thursday to set a date for a bail hearing
according to the indictment, mr namouh planned with mohammed mahmoud, an austrian, and other people who as of yet are unknown, to detonate an explosive in a public place in order to """"cause death, serious injury or massive destruction""""

239511434,MORDECAI RICHLER; A long way from his 'little neighborhood':   [Final Edition ],"The Owl's Nest is a long way from Richler's Jewish-Montreal, St. Urbain Street neighborhood _ the neighborhood that brought to life St. Urbain's Horseman and Joshua Then And Now. Richler has always built his fiction around characters who both proud, and at odds with their Jewishness. Whether they flee to London (where Richler lived for 20 years), or the Eastern Townships, they never quite escape where they're from. [Farley Mowat]'s remarks were quite odd. Perhaps more than any Canadian writer, Richler has explored the greater world while never forgetting that Canada is home. Like his characters, Richler made his way back.","a two-lane blacktop road, shining with black ice in sub-zero temperatures and barely illuminated under a half-moon light, leads to the owl's nest tavern
mordecai richler _ his glasses perched as far down the nose as gravity will allow, baggy clothes over a slightly-stooped frame _ steps carefully across a slippery parking lot
he is known in this eastern townships' bar
the -year-old author retreats here most nights from his home on lake memphremagog
the day just ending has been spent on some of his latest projects: writing a piece for the new yorker magazine on quebec and putting the finishing touches on an anthology of second world war writing
richler has no trouble staying busy along with his novels, he has written film scripts, children's fiction and, in the last few years, a book column for gq magazine
he also fields proposals
''i once got a call from someone who wanted to make a television series about the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz he said: 'we've only got three problems we don't want it set in canada, we don't think it should be jewish, and we don't want it set in the s'
''fortunately i've always retained those rights''
the bartender at the owl's nest automatically serves out two fingers of scotch to ''mordecai'' richler then falls easily into conversation with pete, ralph and some other locals he buys the first round, then they each take their turn
the owl's nest is a long way from richler's jewish-montreal, st urbain street neighborhood _ the neighborhood that brought to life st urbain's horseman and joshua then and now
but going a long way from your own neighborhood is what it's been all about for richler
born in montreal, he is the son of moses and lily richler, who came to canada from a region now part of poland
''my paternal grandfather was actually going to chicago,'' richler explained earlier in the day as he raced around his kitchen preparing a favorite meal of chicken livers
''and on the ship he met somebody who had relatives in chicago and a train ticket to montreal and my grandfather knew of a rabbi in montreal and he had landsmen in montreal, so they exchanged train tickets as simple as that for them it was all america
ironically, the head of the film studio that produced duddy kravitz once chided richler for the montreal setting ''the owner of paramount said to me, 'you schmuck, if you placed this in chicago we could have made a fortune' ''
but richler makes no apologies for an interest in his heritage
''to my mind they were a very heroic generation they couldn't speak the language, they weren't loved jesus, some of them built enormous industries, they created hollywood; even the bronfmans, they built this huge liquor business they were rough, coarse people, but they had energy and imagination like pirates''
in his latest novel, solomon gursky was here, richler chronicles the rise of a bronfman-like immigrant jewish family
the book is a complex, comic journey that moves from russia to england, to the arctic, the prairies and finally to montreal and the townships _ covering a period from the early th century to the s
richler has always built his fiction around characters who both proud, and at odds with their jewishness whether they flee to london (where richler lived for  years), or the eastern townships, they never quite escape where they're from
in spite of richler's savaging of all who stay within their own ghetto _ it's the portrayal of his jewish characters that has left him open to accusations of being a ''a self-hating jew''
he says it stems from his first successful novel, the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz _ the story of a young montrealer who lacks ''an interior life'' kravitz locks his eyes on materialistic goals, shattering everyone along the way
''it was never meant to be a metaphor for the jewish people he was typical of the kids i grew up with i had a lot of time for that character, i don't think he was totally reprehensible at all''
as with salman rushdie's satanic verses, he says, the criticism of duddy kravitz stems mainly from people who haven't even read it
''it's still better to be a jew than a muslim,'' he adds laughing ''no one ever threatened to kill me they just take me to lunch and say, 'if i had the time i could have written it better' ''
in , richler and his wife florence made their return to canada, five children in tow
''i was running out of things to write about; i'm not an englishman''
and then about four years ago, they moved out permanently to their home in the townships it was the last few years of solitude that helped him to finish solomon gursky
the book won the commonwealth writers prize and was short-listed for the prestigious british literary award the booker prize it was not, however, short-listed for the governor general's award a situation richler dismisses ''as a farce''
in the same way that he defined growing up jewish in montreal, he has now laid claim to the eastern townships
in both solomon gursky and joshua then and now, the canadian shield granite-and-slate landscape near bolton centre has moved more to the centre of his writing
''the canadian shield until at least after the referendum,'' he says without missing a beat
indeed, owl's nest regular pete, into his fourth labatt's, will tell you who is the inspiration for which character in solomon gursky
''you know that business at the thirsty boot tavern?'' pete asks ''that really happened''
''according to reports the inspector (from the commission de la langue fran@aise) ordered the thirsty boot to take down their sign and in replace it with a french one'' richler writes in solomon gursky
'' 'sure thing,' the rabbit had said, kneeing the inspector in the groin, just to cut him down to his own height before laying into him 'we're gonna put up a pepper sign all right only it's going to read 'de tirsty boot' after that he could do no wrong''
but tonight's conversation switches quickly to the middle east the owl's nest television is showing replays of a missile attack on tel aviv
earlier that day, richler held forth on a variety of topics, including the persian gulf war and canada's involvement
''mulroney is such a bat boy, and clark thinks he's rambo _ he's got that unfortunate walk, richler says
''the iraqis are right when they talk about double standards bush has kept this bastard in arms for years and now he suddenly says, 'why this is outrageous, he's a gangster' who in the hell sold him all those arms? where were they with the kurds?''
richler never edits himself: it comes from a strong intellect that can smell the ludicrous from a mile away
during the free-trade debate, he was one of the very few canadian artists to support the deal that stance so enraged author farley mowat, that he called richler a ''non-canadian''
''oh god, yeah,'' richler groans, striking his knife down on another hard-boiled egg
''mordecai richler has his own sense of identity,'' mowat said last year to a toronto newspaper ''it's his jewish identity and it's his little neighborhood identity he has no sense of canadian identity at all''
''farley was very annoyed that i came out in favor in free trade,'' richler says in a tone preparing to strike at this ludicrous controversy
''he's an ardent nationalist and he probably had a bit to drink he's not the most punishingly intelligent man i've ever met
''but i don't credit mulroney with having a lot of imagination he was trying to hold on to what we have if they started putting tariffs on american goods we were up the creek, because we don't sell anything anywhere else
''all this stuff about canadian culture being threatened was a red herring there is a lot of nationalist hysteria any time the us is mentioned what were they thinking, that somebody was going to buy coach house press? the americans are not crazy, they're interested in money''
mowat's remarks were quite odd perhaps more than any canadian writer, richler has explored the greater world while never forgetting that canada is home like his characters, richler made his way back
and like his more endearing characters, he takes comfort in the strength gained from standing apart from every ghetto, jewish or otherwise
and if mowat wants proof, he should head down to the owl's nest some night
''mordecai,'' says pete, not inclined to say no to a fifth labatt's, ''is a hell of a good guy''

she feels police are doing something positive and should be praised she also feels that by speaking out, she can encourage others to get involved in future programs
as a sample of what happened, she points to this story: ''a reluctant member of the group said he had little trust in policemen, and recounted a story about how he was arrested, more than once, because he was ''another drunk indian'' but as tensions eased and conversation increased, he understood he was arrested for being drunk, and race had nothing to do with it''

on canada day, tenants from ridgemont terrace in southeast ottawa gathered in their local park to celebrate at a community picnic
organizers, however, were surprised at what happened: white people, munching barbecued hotdogs and watermelon, gathered in one part of the park; blacks set up tables at the other end
there wasn't any animosity, but the segregation was a sign of divisions in this community of  townhouses tucked along ledbury avenue, near bank and walkley
``i just don't understand where did this come from?'' says sandra vezina, a volunteer who spent months planning egg races, fireworks and a karaoke contest at the end of the day, she gathered up plastic bags full of dollar-store prizes, unclaimed because many black kids didn't participate, went home, and cried
a small event in itself, but part of a slow slide into misunderstanding that has worried residents in a community where people pride themselves on getting along with neighbors
like other public housing developments in ottawa, ridgemont terrace has changed rapidly over the last five years as refugees and immigrants moved in new cultures, languages and more visible minorities have meant adjustments for everyone there have been no major problems
but recently, a tenants' association election triggered tension that community leaders are anxious to quell before it escalates the last two months at ridgemont terrace have been punctuated by racist graffiti, allegations of electoral fraud, hard feelings and fear
the ridgemont tale shows how easily misunderstandings can arise when there are cultural and language differences some newcomers from undemocratic countries are not familiar with how elections -- even those for tenants' association -- are run some long-time canadians assume immigrant women are submissive and uneducated, and will simply vote for the candidate chosen by their male community leaders
and while race is not the only issue in these disputes, it simmers below the surface rumors -- like the one that whites were bused in from another neighborhood to sway the vote -- have attained the status of truth among some blacks who already suspect their neighbors of being prejudiced
add to the mix some old-fashioned political battles and personality clashes, and it a snarl that residents are now working to unravel some tenants have organized a meeting monday to look for solutions before tension escalates
a public discussion of the allegations and suspicions may be just what the community needs, says vezina ``for all the rumors and all the misunderstandings, we aren't dealing with stupid people if they are made aware of the facts, it will be straightened out, in the community''
but bob davidson, new president of the tenants' association, isn't so sure it will be that easy a bulldog of a man, an out-of-work stone paver, davidson says the problem is some ``garden variety bigots'' who don't like black people in positions of power
``i feel like allende in the last days of the presidential palace,'' davidson says, referring to the socialist president of chile who was killed in a military coup in 
the problems began, davidson believes, when he challenged the old-guard tenants' association, which was dominated by white women like any politician, davidson courted support among a potentially powerful voting bloc: the somalis, who occupy about a third of the units in the development
davidson promised to open up the community house, run by the tenants' association, for somali language lessons on saturdays he recruited respected somali leaders to canvass for him and a somali tenant, abdi bakal, entered the race for vice-president
``the president of the community was white, the vice-president was white, the treasurer was white, all white people,'' explains bakal somalis decided it was time for them to be represented, he says
the intertwining of politics and race was divisive davidson says his campaign literature was stolen, his phone line was cut, and he received anonymous calls late at night now there a petition circulating to remove him from office
``the reason i'm under siege right now is because i'm accused of pandering to the blacks,'' he says
reva huard, past president, dismisses allegations of prejudice as a ``bunch of baloney'' like several others, she accuses davidson of stirring up ethnic tensions with his volatile style
a tiny, straight-talking woman, huard didn't campaign or make promises after eight years as president, she figured people knew her ``i was a volunteer for everything anytime there was a little squabble going on, or a bicycle to be fixed, they'd come to my placei'd fix lights, i'd fix doors'' huard says that while many somalis supported davidson, she picked up support among some ethiopians, partly because they have political differences with somalis
election day was may  as ballots were being counted, huard looked out her window to see ottawa police arrive in riot gear
``i see all these swat teams coming out, with these big suits on them and rifles and everything else i said, `my god, did somebody commit murder?' and they said no, it just that bob life was threatened or some darn thing
``i said holy good gravy, this is wild''
the swat story has become part of election-day lore, repeated by people, including davidson himself, to illustrate how tense things were but actually, the incident had nothing to do with the election a tenant happened to be hanging around outside the voting hall, a man who earns his living by ``engaging in illegal activities,'' in the delicate wording of property manager wayne lanthier the man apparently warned davidson, a neighbor, to keep his mouth shut about those activities police arrived prepared for the worst because they feared the man might be violent or have a weapon, said lanthier
davidson won the post of president, and bakal was elected vice-president
a few days later, racist slogans were spraypainted on half a dozen somali homes to some, the connection seemed obvious
strolling down ledbury avenue, daughter toddling beside him, mohamed farah says he always felt comfortable in the neighborhood, where children play in the park late into the night now, he not so sure ``it makes us feel really bad -- alienated, discriminated it destroyed our dignity and freedom we were having here in canada''
when vezina saw the vandalism, she felt sick she pleads for understanding, saying she believes the culprits were a couple of punks upset about a fight the night before: ``please don't be afraid we're not all idiots like the person who sprayed that paint''
then, housing authorities discovered bakal was not officially a ridgemont tenant, because he had split up with his wife and moved back in with her without adding his name to the lease his election as vice-president was thrown out, and a new election called
huard entered the race, as did another somali candidate that when some somalis, unfamiliar with the election system, started wondering whether things were fixed ``i don't know if the constitution of canada allows that,'' says one somali tenant skeptically, wondering why huard was allowed to run again for another position
by the time the new election for vice-president was held, on june , tempers were hot huard saw a group of women talking --in somali -- to the somali candidate outside the voting hall she assumed he was telling them how to vote ``i went right into the polling (station) and yelled there was cheating going on outside, and i wanted another election'' huard won, and later apologized to the somali women for her outburst
meanwhile, some somalis remain convinced that whites were bused in from a nearby community for the vote ``that absolute nonsense,'' says bonnie moore, co-ordinator at the community house a voter list was used, moore says probably some people didn't recognize some of their neighbors who came to vote, and jumped to conclusions, moore says
but by the day after the election, opinions had hardened some somali women boycotted english lessons run out of the tenants' community house ``somali people don't accept this election,'' says bakal flatly ``it fraud''
now, more rumors are circulating bakal says he heard there was a secret meeting for white people a couple weeks ago ``why? they refuse a meeting of somalis? this is not south africa''
people organizing monday meeting hope it will provide a chance for some of the allegations and fears to be aired, a chance for people to, in moore words, ``gripe, yell, carry on and get it out of their system''
vezina says the community always prided itself on getting along, and she confident things will be worked out
``we've got to do whatever we can to get that pride back''

1542268533,Military programs fail to lure needed aboriginal recruits,"The findings are contained in a government-commissioned study that comes at the same time as the Canadian Forces are pushing to slash recruitment targets for aboriginals, women and visible minorities.","  several programs that introduced hundreds of young aboriginal people to the canadian military over the past few years have been well-received by participants, but they appear to have done little to bolster recruitment numbers
the findings are contained in a government-commissioned study that comes at the same time as the canadian forces are pushing to slash recruitment targets for aboriginals, women and visible minorities the move has prompted concern and criticism from opposition parties and others
the military currently has three programs specifically targeted to aboriginal people
one involves a three-week introduction to military life that is very similar to basic training another entails spending a year studying at the royal military college of canada in kingston both accept only a few dozen applicants each year
the last program is a six-week summer camp, where hundreds of participants take part in some basic training while getting an opportunity to speak with currently serving military personnel they also learn about the role aboriginal people have played in canada's military history
in each case, the government covers all costs and participants who go through the full three-or six-week course receive $, or $,, respectively
participants can leave at any time, and while the goal is to bolster aboriginal recruitment, there is no pressure to join
it's unclear exactly how much the government spends on these programs each year, but a rough calculation indicates it gave participants at least $-million between  and 
to find out whether the program was working, the government commissioned a study last year that found the programs """"are doing a good job providing aboriginal people with an introduction to the forces and the military lifestyle
""""this introduction, however, has not translated into enlistments,"""" the study says """"very few of the program participants interviewed have actually joined the (canadian armed forces) despite having seriously considered the caf as a career option as a result of the programs""""
the finding is not good news for the canadian forces the forces are expected to aim at having aboriginals make up  per cent of personnel in uniform, under the auspices of the employment equity act now, however, aboriginals only account for  per cent
in addition to having a legal obligation to increase aboriginal recruitment, there is also a practical impetus unlike the rest of the population, the aboriginal community is growing fast aboriginals on average also tend to be much younger than non-aboriginals
""""the implications of these statistics for the caf (canadian armed forces) are that its pool of potential recruits will decline,"""" the study reads
""""in order to attain its annual recruitment goals, the caf will have to devise effective strategies to reach out to aboriginal people to encourage them to pursue a career in the caf""""
the military is currently pushing to lower the -per-cent target for aboriginal recruitment to  per cent it also wants to cut the targets for women and visible minorities, from  per cent and  per cent respectively, to  per cent and  per cent
military leaders have said the current goals are unrealistic, but some fear the canadian forces are simply trying to take the easy way out rather than genuinely address recruitment problems
participants in the three aboriginal-focused programs could not say what might be changed to convince them or others to join the military, but the study does have a number of recommendations, such as publicizing the programs more and running them for longer periods
liberal foreign affairs critic marc garneau feared the report would be used to justify cutting the recruitment targets, but said the canadian forces should act upon the recommendations and redouble recruiting efforts first
garneau said having high employment equity targets while he was president of the canadian space agency resulted in more women on panels interviewing job applicants, which helped to ensure more fairness in the process
""""so you've got to keep the goals there, and you've got to keep the effort on,"""" he said, """"and not throw in the towel""""
defence minister rob nicholson's press secretary, johanna quinney, said the government is """"proud of the important role aboriginals play in our military,"""" but that the government would be """"guided by merit"""" when it comes to canadian military recruiting lberthiaume@ottawacitizencom twittercom/leeberthiaume

mr easter is one of the mps who pushed for ethics commissioner bernard shapiro's probe into former liberal david emerson's appointment to primer minister stephen harper's cabinet
at least three of the dozen or more men and women who are considering a liberal leadership bid are far from longtime liberals

unlike mr emerson or ms stronach, mr brison did not take a cabinet post until after his constituents elected him as a liberal in june , six months after he crossed the floor
mr brison is not squirming about his former membership in the progressive conservative party and he likened his passion for the liberal party to an immigrant who chooses canada and finds it a wonderful place
mr brison said in an interview yesterday that in testing the waters for a leadership run he has earned """"a strong level of support among people who have been in the liberal party their whole lives there's a recognition my decision to join the liberal party was based on values""""
""""and my discussions with paul martin, before i joined the liberal party of canada, were on the direction paul martin and the liberal party wanted to take the country and on the values of the liberal party,"""" he said """"we didn't talk about positions we talked about the future of the country""""
mr brison recalled that he joined the liberals when the progressive conservatives were merging with the alliance/reform party """"people who know and understand my positions on issues of social progress can understand why it would have been impossible for me to work with the alliance/reform party at that time,"""" he said
but when martha hall findlay, the toronto lawyer who is the only declared candidate so far, launched her campaign last month, she said ms stronach should have sat as an independent until the election that followed her defection from the conservatives
mr rae has not declared his intentions about a potential leadership bid, and mr easter said he doesn't even know if the former premier is a card-carrying liberal party member yet

a: my parents were czechoslovakian immigrants they came in  to canada  i was born in orillia, where my grandparents lived, and then i moved to toronto almost immediately my parents had just moved to toronto and we lived in a neighbourhood called crombie park, which was a kind of progressive neighbourhood built in the late 's we relocated to toronto, but still very much had roots in orillia throughout my childhood

alexandra suda named director of national gallery of canada( https://ottawacitizencom/news/local-news/alexandra-suda-to-be-named-director-of-national-gallery-of-canada )
as a high school student, i went to a school called loretto abbey, which was a catholic girls school in toronto, and i was quite an avid athlete at that time i went to princeton university and joined the rowing team there, eventually becoming the captain of the heavyweight women's crew team, and also was an all-american, for what that's worth
q: did you go to princeton to row or to study art history?
a: i went there with the objective of studying one of the humanities i knew it would either be literature, history or art history when i started taking courses in art history in my first semester, it became very clear to me that that's what i would be doing princeton is the place where i fell in love with art history it has one of the great collections of art in its museum and one of the most wonderful faculties as well
q: you've risen quickly in the art world, from completing your doctorate to working at the metropolitan museum of art in new york and then the art gallery of ontario to taking the helm at the national gallery before you're 
a: it strikes me as the right opportunity for me right now  i'm blazing trails, i think i see that in some ways but there are incredible men and women who have come before me who have done much more impressive things that have created a foundation making my situation possible
q: what appeals to you about taking on this role?
a: i've always felt, from the early days, there's an urgency to the need for art it's not a 'nice to have' it's a 'need to have' i took on that kind of responsibility to share that urgency very early in my career whenever i have had the opportunity to do that, to amplify what artists are saying or doing, in the past i've taken that opportunity to advance the ideas
i characterize myself as a deeply passionate and curious individual, and those two things were driving forces within my own desire to advance within museum administration
q: your specialization is in european art will that be reflected in your leadership?
a: i would say that a director doesn't play favourites i certainly have no kind of european agenda in my role i want to learn about everything else, too being a director is such an amazing privilege  you get to learn about all the other areas within the arts that you are not as familiar with
q: it's been reported that you are not bilingual what efforts will you make to learn french?
a: i see that as one of the great perks, being able to learn that language and function in it fluently i've had training in french as an art historian since my undergraduate degree, and have been reading and functioning in french within the art market for some time one of the great opportunities of this job is to work in that language

earlier this month, toronto mayoral contender june rowlands re- ignited an ongoing controversy by citing police crime sheets which, she said, show that the number of crimes committed by black youth is disproportionate to the black population in metro
these sheets can be misleading, however they are only a summary of what police consider to be major crimes the race is given only when a suspect is being sought
rowlands critics immediately cried racism
but the debate was sparked even before the mayoral race for example, in july, metro police sergeant ben eng appeared before a crime inquiry and said that vietnamese and mainland chinese refugees commit """"the vast majority"""" of asian crime
head of the metro police services board, susan eng (no relation), responded quickly """"statistics based on race, color or creed are an affront to the concept of equality before the law,"""" she said tersely
in fact, metro police, along with most canadian police forces, aren't allowed to collect statistics on the basis of race but tentatively, and oh so carefully, some people (besides police) are beginning to push for racially based crime statistics
the time is ripe, they say the question of how to deal with crime is becoming increasingly complicated and fear of crime seems to be at an all-time high
""""if there is a social or economic need for these stats - and there is - such stats should be gathered,"""" says david bercuson, a history professor at the university of calgary """"they tell us what is wrong in society and what needs to be fixed""""
opponents argue that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing; that statistics involving race would serve merely to fuel the flames of racism harish jain, a professor in mcmaster university school of business, warns that the area is a minefield
""""'we have already had race riots in nova scotia, an inquiry into police activities (involving natives) in manitoba, and shootings of blacks in toronto,"""" jain says """"those incidents keep repeating themselves if we say it because of a racial group, it would be most unfortunate all we'd be doing is reinforcing existing stereotypes""""
there are sharp differences in practice north and south of the border
while most social activists in canada appear to oppose the collection of criminal statistics on the basis of race, their counterparts in the us not only have accepted this for years, but say that these statistics help to further their cause
canada has been cautious when it comes to collecting racially based statistics as one observer puts it: """"the government has always been very paranoid about a social backlash""""
questions about race are avoided not only are there few statistics on the relationship between race and crime, there are no national figures that make a link between race and poverty, education, access to health services, or other important social indicators
the canadian centre for justice statistics in ottawa, an arm of statistics canada, keeps only two sets of statistics based on race: homicides and the proportion of natives and non-natives in prison
but while the statistics on natives are revealing, they are of limited use, says philip stenning, an associate professor of criminology at the university of toronto
they show that there are more natives in jail than in university; that while natives make up only  per cent of saskatchewan population, they represent two-thirds of the province prison inmates
but because no other statistics are kept, it impossible to say whether native canadians commit more crimes than the rest of the population or whether they're the victims of a racist justice system, or whether it a combination of the two
""""if better statistics were kept on native people, we might be able to answer those questions,"""" says stenning """"the same could be said of blacks they are grossly over-represented in institutions (prisons) but we don't know whether they commit more crimes or whether the police target them the only way to know is to collect stats""""
ut stenning is wary of racially based stats he worries about accuracy and reliability who would do the collecting and analysis? and what use would ultimately be made of them?
""""i wouldn't want to leave it (the collection) to an untrained police sergeant,"""" he says """"but you'd need the co-operation of the police it a tough one""""
americans involved in the business of collecting stats are amazed that canadians feel they are in a quandary
they point out proudly that they've collected crime statistics on the basis of race since the 's never, they say, have there been any negative racial repercussions
""""and that interesting,"""" says harper wilson, chief of the fbi uniform crime reporting program, """"because we probably have more racial tension than in canada""""
every month, , law enforcement agencies (municipal police, state troopers and sheriffs) send a report on """"criminal incidents"""" to the fbi
the information includes the age, race and sex of each person arrested the fbi collates the material and releases its findings on a monthly basis the cost: $ million a year
""""the primary reason for collecting it,"""" says wilson, """"is to provide a common denominator language to look at crime and how best to address it
""""we want to know the race of people arrested in order to get a better profile of offenders and we know the information is comprehensive; it covers more than  per cent of the population""""
the system is not without its flaws, however the uniform crime report provides information on arrests only
yet in aggravated assaults, arrests are made in only  per cent of the cases in forcible rape, the figure drops to  per cent
and police tend to arrest the people they most often come into contact with this means they are much more likely to arrest a young adult male committing a petty offence in a public place than a corporate president committing fraud in the private confines of his tower office
in addition, the fbi does not collect statistics on convictions so if police were harassing a particular racial group, this information would not surface in fact, the fbi report would make it appear as if the racial group being harassed was committing a disproportionate percentage of crimes
this lack of follow-through has been exposed
the statistics collected by the fbi, for example, showed that in  blacks were responsible for half the violent crime in us cities this seemed an astounding figure, given that they make up only  per cent of the urban population
but more comprehensive statistics gathered by the department of justice showed that the rates for blacks and whites committing aggravated assault were virtually identical;  per , of the black population, as compared to  per , of the white population
harles kindermann is associate director of the department bureau of justice statistics he says the justice department has been keeping stats on both victims and offenders since 
""""every six months, we go to , households with our national victim survey,"""" he says
""""we ask whether anyone has been a victim of crime and ask for characteristics of the offender we also collect information on the correctional population; who there, criminal history, race, and so on and we do a regular, sample survey of the courts in order to draw generalizations
""""none of this material has been used explosively""""
even if it had, kindermann points out that the use or abuse of stats is beyond the purview of those doing the collecting
""""the information could be misused,"""" he admits """"but you can't control that in fact, we don't try to exercise any control our obligation is to collect the stats as best we can""""
the us government seems to make every effort to fulfil a promise of comprehensiveness the bureau of census has a crime survey branch every month, it collects information on reported and unreported crimes
included in the survey is a detailed description of victims and (perceived) offenders' characteristics, including race
""""this is useful,"""" says larry mcginn, chief of the crime survey branch """"we include the victim race, age, sex, marital status, employment status, residence, what they were doing at the time of the incident - all the details and we try to get the victim perception of the offender; race, approximate age, sex, known or stranger
""""congress has used this material to determine if victim assistance programs should be set up,"""" says mcginn
occasionally, he adds, the statistics destroy widely held myths
""""we found that the elderly are the least-victimized group in society,"""" he says """"the most victimized group is young people between the ages of  and """"
it hard to find anyone in the us opposed to collecting stats on the basis of race but this seems to have as much to do with the comprehensiveness of the collection, as with the checks and balances built into the system
the national association for the advancement of colored people, for example, doesn't collect its own stats but uses the government to support its civil rights advocacy work and educational activities
""""the collection of raw stats is less troubling than the way things used to be done routinely in the media,"""" says naacp research director walter morrison
""""until a few years ago, racial identity was published in crime stories today that limited to situations where the perpetrator is at large and race is critical to identification, or to where racial tensions are a part of the story
""""but when it was done routinely, this had the effect of creating the feeling that crime was closely tied to race""""
morrison says it important to know that one-quarter of all us black males between the ages of  and  are either in prison, on probation, or on parole
""""here, crime is seen as black crime,"""" he says """"but blacks commit more crime disproportionate to their population, because so much crime is economic""""
unlike canada, anti-poverty organizations and civil rights groups can turn to their government-collected stats to find out if there is a relationship between poverty and crime and race or, between educational achievement and crime and race
you name it, the us collects it and statistics often document systemic racial discrimination
in , us law required money lenders to collect stats based on race, gender and income
the first study of the findings, as reported by the new york times this week, reveals that blacks and other minorities are denied mortgages far more frequently than whites with comparable incomes
sheriff pat sullivan of arapahoe county near denver, colo , says he couldn't do his job without the information he gleans from stats from it, he says, he learned that crime by asians was on the increase this allowed him to make arrangements for an interpreter to be on call  hours a day
the information is also useful in planning educational materials for the , prisoners a year that pass through the two county jails
finally, he says, """"we use the information in the training, and recruiting, of officers they learn to be sensitive to language not to use 'nigger', or pic', for example, or any of the many negative words that came out of the vietnam war""""
toronto lawyer clayton ruby isn't buying any of these kinds of arguments
""""the only reason for collecting these stats is to feed racism,"""" he says """"they may be useful for some intellectual exercise, but it not academics who want them it cops, especially lower-level cops, who want to blame someone""""
yet, the university of calgary bercuson says, """"stats don't generate hate people do""""
the debate is misplaced, he says, because if hard-core racists don't have statistical information, they'll simply make it up """"do you say 'taboo' anytime non-white males are involved - that you won't compile stats,"""" he asks
ontario solicitor-general allan pilkey says the provincial government is generally opposed to collecting racially based crime statistics because they have been used to stereotype visible minorities
but federal solicitor-general doug lewis says it makes a lot of sense as it could help police departments decide whether they have the right racial mix in their forces

mclaughlin, a -year-old yukoner, won by a vote of , to , over former british columbia premier dave barrett on the fourth ballot at a tense and exciting new democratic party convention
while rosemary brown, the black woman who  years ago lost the ndp leadership to ed broadbent, danced a joyous victory dance on stage, mclaughlin told reporters she feels """"ready to take on the world""""
mclaughlin locked hands with broadbent in the winner's salute, then told the delegates the ndp is the party of peace, the environment, working people and farmers
""""we've shown canadians we have a truly national vision, a truly national vision,"""" she said
of the , delegates at the three-day convention, only  were from quebec and a total of only  from the atlantic provinces
but mclaughlin said new democrats will soon be marching across the nation, and exhorted the troops to give the ndp its first quebec mp by electing candidate phil edmonston in the by-election in chambly
delegates who pinned on yellow """"audrey"""" buttons for the last ballot overcame deep concerns about mclaughlin's vacuous and poorly delivered speech on friday night, and her lack of experience she has been a member of parliament for only two years after winning a by-election in yukon riding
but she was bolstered by three powerful factors:
* a party establishment, including senior labor leaders, which had decided it was time for a woman
* a strong current among female new democrats that this time they'd vote for their own sex
* the decisions of three other male candidates - simon de jong, howard mccurdy and steven langdon - to climb aboard her winning bandwagon
she also benefitted from the -year-old barrett's crucial mistake in the first days of the leadership race when he called quebec premier robert bourassa a hypocrite and raised concerns that he would alienate quebec so thoroughly the party would lose its tiny base in that province
langdon, the windsor mp who came third, cited that factor yesterday when he quietly told his supporters that he was going to throw his support to mclaughlin on the final ballot she has, he said, the same national vision of canada as he
mclaughlin opposes the meech lake constitutional accord, but even quebecers say they forgive her that because she represents the yukon's concern that the accord will prevent the territory from becoming a province in the near future as well, she speaks passable french, while barrett is unilingual
apart from the deep reservations about her capacity as a public speaker and her intellectual depth, mclaughlin comes to the leadership relatively unscathed by the hard-fought leadership campaign
she had support from all factions, including major party figures like the autoworkers' bob white, the steelworkers' leo gerard, saskatchewan party leader roy romanow, nova scotia leader alexa mcdonough, manitoba leader gary doer and - unobtrusively - ontario leader bob rae
stood for change
and while barrett gained some strength from new democrats who complained that once again the backroom boys from ontario were manipulating a convention, mclaughlin escaped being tarred by that brush
because she is a woman and a westerner, mclaughlin was able to present herself as standing for change
the only one of the losing candidates who resisted this appeal while dropping off the ballot was ian waddell, the impish mp from port moody-coquitlam, bc, who went over to support his friend dave barrett after the first ballot
mclaughlin, said waddell, had too much establishment support for his taste and he wanted barrett as leader to """"shake things up""""
barrett, who won his first parliamentary seat in the  election, has a reputation, from his days as bc premier, as a populist politician who goes his own way and cannot be controlled by his handlers
in the corridors, mclaughlin's supporters stressed barrett's erratic nature, and warned he could prove an embarrassment as national leader
healing gesture
howard mccurdy, a black man who stressed in his campaign the need to open the party to visible minorities, ethnics and women, surprised nearly everyone by walking over to langdon after the first vote
having parked with langdon briefly, he took his support after the second ballot to mclaughlin
mccurdy supporters explained his move to langdon as a peace- making gesture intended to heal bad feeling between the two windsor- area mps, who publicly vilified one another during the race
mclaughlin sat a little dismayed in the stands after the first ballot: barrett had picked up waddell and mccurdy was sitting with langdon it appeared to all the media pundits that she'd lost momentum
there was joy in beaming barrett's camp, with supporters boasting their man now was on the way to the top
but then came the fatal blow after the second ballot, regina mp simon de jong stunned the barrett camp by walking to mclaughlin de jong hoped, he explained, to become the """"queenmaker""""
'now, steven'
shortly after that, mccurdy completed his pilgrimage, abandoning langdon to support mclaughlin he'd joined her, mccurdy explained, because """"the party has to open to women's equality and to minorities""""
but langdon supporters said bitterly that mccurdy had made a deal with langdon which he hadn't wanted to keep
""""mccurdy never contemplated that he'd do worse than steven and have to come to us, instead of us to him,"""" one supporter said
having picked up two leadership candidates, mclaughlin's exhilarated supporters began shouting at langdon: """"now, steven, now""""
but his troops locked arms and sang back: """"we shall not be moved""""
langdon had decided to go one more round, standing for the third ballot but he knew the game was over
before the results of the ballot were announced, langdon quietly gathered his key people in the stands and told them he would embrace mclaughlin's cause in the next few minutes
white-faced
at that point, the fourth and final ballot results became inevitable
barrett took a share of langdon's supporters, but with three of his rival candidates sitting in mclaughlin's camp he had already lost
as the vote result was read, barrett sat white-faced but poised
then he went to the stage to tell the delegates: """"we are a united party"""" - meaning he will work with his new leader

even now, with several physiotherapy sessions a week and two young children, her time is limited nonetheless, she's spent much of the past two years improving her english, to the point where she can talk to her language tutor about her feelings, her anxieties and her dreams
her tutor, linda gaucher, is a volunteer for an organization called english language tutoring for the ottawa community, or eltoc, which is funded by citizenship and immigration canada the program helps newcomers who can't make it out to language classes, because of work schedules, health problems or disabilities, or because they're caring for children or elderly parents

1710883873,"Refugee needs outweigh terrorism risk, experts say","[...]the government should not be presenting refugee resettlement here as an either/or option with anti-terrorism efforts, says Scott Watson, an associate professor of international relations at the University of Victoria.","  the risk that some islamist terrorists could infiltrate canada posing as syrian refugees is a valid concern but shouldn't be overblown, national security specialists say
""""it is possible that among the stream of wretched refugees desperately looking for a way, that there might be some who aren't exactly the people we want to bring in,"""" said reg whitaker, a security and intelligence expert and adjunct professor at the university of victoria
but """"the idea that (isil) has some kind of a plan to plant agents in here"""" via the refugee process for syrians: """"this is crazy""""
whitaker was reacting to comments wednesday by conservative leader stephen harper about how national security will dictate the pace of canada's response to the syrian refugee crisis
""""when we are dealing with people that are from, in many cases, a terrorist war zone, we are going to make sure that we screen people appropriately and the security of this country is fully protected,"""" harper said at a campaign stop in welland, ont
""""we cannot open the floodgates and airlift tens of thousands of refugees out of a terrorist war zone without proper process that is too great a risk for canada,"""" he said during a q-and-a session
harper's remarks continue a security narrative the conservatives launched after the fatal terror attacks by isil sympathizers in ottawa and saint-jean-sur-richelieu almost a year ago national security is a key plank in the party's election platform
but the government should not be presenting refugee resettlement here as an either/or option with anti-terrorism efforts, says scott watson, an associate professor of international relations at the university of victoria
""""i think it's possible to do a large-scale operation of assisting refugees that (also) has a thorough screening component for security reasons, if there was enough political will to do so i think both can be done,"""" he said
""""the vast majority of the people have no interest in contributing to further violence there could be a couple of people who are sympathetic to isil coming in, but if there's proper security screening and proper integration once refugees are brought into the country, i don't think it's something we need to be concerned about""""
besides, there are """"much better ways for them (isil) to do what they want to do than to use refugees as the means of doing it,"""" watson said
he and whitaker have done extensive research on the rise of national security fears that have accompanied concentrated waves of immigration to canada harper's framing of the syrian refugee crisis in security terms is similar to concerns, ultimately unfounded, that communist infiltrators would accompany the arrival of hungarian refugees to canada in , or with the cambodian and vietnamese boat people in the late s whitaker concludes many refugee groups now tend to be seen as importers of external political conflicts to the west
canadian security intelligence service (csis) officers overseas are responsible for much of the security vetting of refugees and immigrants many refugees understandably have no official identity documents but, """"you can't go back to the syrians or an area that's no longer under iraqi government control and say, 'by the way, is muhammad a resident of erbil?'"""" said ray boisvert, a former csis assistant director of intelligence
""""you try to do your best to interview them and get a decent sense of their background and see if you can poke any holes in it""""
boisvert, too, says the current humanitarian need outweighs possible risks from terrorism """"it is a very manageable risk if you're conscious that there is a risk and that you do not undermine the efforts of csis assets to do their job in the screening process""""

239562087,ASSESSING THE COST OF QUEBEC INDEPENDENCE; Added financial load would fall to Ontario:   [Final Edition ],"Second, some proportion of the trade between Quebec and Ontario would be disrupted. How much is not, at this point, knowable. The expectation is that Quebec would come out distinctly second best, since the net migration of people and headquarters would be toward Ontario. Indeed, it is not difficult to conjure up scenarios wherein Ontario would also be inundated by migrants from Atlantic Canada, particularly since cuts in federal-provincial transfers in the past two federal budgets have left the future of social programs in those provinces in considerable doubt. To this ''push'' phenomenon one must add the ''pull'' of Ontario, now that it has staked out its position as Canada social policy leader. Sooner or later, these factors will begin to come to the fore, especially as Ontario contemplates further tax hikes over the next few years. This may be exacerbated in any breakup scenario if other provinces were to pressure Ontario to take an uncompromising stance _ and one counter to its own self-interest _ toward Quebec. Combined with the earlier comments about the province competitiveness, the choice for Ontario would be to trigger this self-interest or face a hemorrhaging of economic activity toward the south. In other words, at what point would looking south or asserting its dominance in the federation make a lot more sense for Ontario than looking west and (leapfrog-style) looking east? Or, if the focus is still east-west, at what point would Ontario insist that the interregional transfer system become effectively emasculated or ''Americanized'' _ presumably with support on this issue from Alberta and British Columbia? The second thrust _ which really dominates the Allaire Report (of Quebec governing Liberal party) _ is that the global economic community is passing Canada by. The Canadian federation is faltering economically. It is too ''entangled'' in some areas, unable at the federal level to control deficits, poorly structured in terms of the relationship of the Bank of Canada to the federal government, Canadians are overgoverned, and on and on. Quebec, on the other hand, perceives itself _ perhaps wrongly _ as a ''winner'' on the economic front over the 1980s and wants to be part of a federation that, at the centre, also acts in ways that allow Canadians to ''win.'' In this sense, Quebec challenge to ROC is to reconstitute itself _ along with Quebec _ in a manner consistent with benefiting from the ongoing and inevitable globalization, rather than fighting rearguard skirmishes that leave Canada falling behind its trading partners. As I noted at the beginning of this study, this is the ''opportunity'' aspect of the ongoing challenge _ an opportunity for all Canadians to rethink and restructure how, as a society, they ought to position themselves in the emerging global reality.","two recent reports have taken a look at the economic consequences of quebec independence thomas courchene in praise of renewed federation, one of a series of studies by the cc howe institute on the economics of constitutional renewal, examines options for canada future the following contains excerpts from the study by courchene, director of the school of policy studies at queen university, kingston the second report, by ottawa consultant patrick grady of global economics ltd, was done for employment and immigration canada he examined studies of the costs and benefits of confederation; ran with sidebar headlined """"smaller cohesive society more likely to pull together""""
the entre into this discussion is to assume that, for whatever reason, quebec opts for independence moreover, assume that a canada-quebec economic and monetary union is not in the cards, but that free trade agreements (ftas) between quebec and both the united states and roc (rest of canada) are successfully negotiated i will further assume that the separation is reasonably friendly the final assumption is that i shall focus on the position of ontario
two background implications must be put on the table first, as revealed by its recent budget, ontario deficit for fiscal year - is forecast to be roughly $ billion, over three times as large as the current deficit and, indeed, as any in its previous history moreover, projections are that the deficit is structural, in the sense that in fiscal year - the estimated deficit will still be above $ billion this has dramatic implications for the current constitutional debate much of the ''bon voyage'' or ''let quebec go'' movement in roc assumes that ontario, along with british columbia and alberta, would continue to play the role of roc ''paymasters'' in terms of maintaining interregional transfers the six roc ''have not'' provinces must surely be rethinking all of this in light of the ontario budget
the second implication is this: while one may not want to overlay cyclical and policy issues with the constitutional question, it has to be pointed out that ontario economy is on precarious ground it is ''hollowing out'' and bleeding at the borders under the external effects of the recession, federal interest-rate and exchange-rate policies, the goods and services tax, and the internal or self-imposed consequences of an already unfavorable tax environment vis-vis the united states, soon to be made worse by ontario debt and deficit overhang part of the 'oon-to-be made worse'' scenario is the fact that unless combined ontario and federal taxes fall more into line internationally, ontario tax base will begin to ''migrate'' this is the current backdrop not only for an exit by quebec but also for the prospects of roc surviving as a single, united entity
what, then, would ontario concerns be?
the first is that neither the canada-us fta nor the auto pact likely would remain intact _ the latter because ontario could no longer deliver the quebec market and the former because the move from a bilateral to a multilateral fta would give the united states an opening to renegotiate the present fta
second, some proportion of the trade between quebec and ontario would be disrupted how much is not, at this point, knowable the expectation is that quebec would come out distinctly second best, since the net migration of people and headquarters would be toward ontario indeed, it is not difficult to conjure up scenarios wherein ontario would also be inundated by migrants from atlantic canada, particularly since cuts in federal-provincial transfers in the past two federal budgets have left the future of social programs in those provinces in considerable doubt to this ''push'' phenomenon one must add the ''pull'' of ontario, now that it has staked out its position as canada social policy leader
third, if quebec economic situation deteriorated substantially, this would, of necessity, reflect on both ontario and roc in terms of credit ratings in international capital markets, particularly since canada debt would remain roc official responsibility if the economic situation in quebec dictated an inevitable reneging on its debt-sharing obligations to roc, this would get reflected, internationally, as a roc problem
fourth, in terms of putting ''new canada'' together again, the six ''have-not'' provinces, as already alluded to, would want some commitment from ontario, alberta, and british columbia to continue to underwrite the equalization system
fifth, all other provinces, particularly alberta and british columbia, would want some checks and balances _ a triple-e senate or a severing of ontario into, say, three provinces _ to prevent ontario more than  percent (after the in-migration) of the population from dominating roc
at what point do ontarians move to pursue their own self-interest? after all, a separate ontario would make much more sense, economically, than a separate quebec, particularly if ontario could get some sort of ''deal'' with the united states on autos there has been a great deal of discussion as to whether quebec is a net beneficiary of confederation in the narrow sense of dollar inflows and outflows yet there is no question about ontario position: in  alone, it was a net contributor to the tune of between $ and $, per capital depending on how the deficit is allocated, or somewhere between $ billion and $ billion in nominal terms one can throw in another $ billion for the net outflows associated with the operations of unemployment insurance
while alberta and british columbia are also net contributors _ in this narrow ''balance sheet'' approach _ the point for ontario is simply that its budget would be in surplus over the next four years in the absence of outflows of these magnitudes, instead of rolling up a projected $ billion in debt
sooner or later, these factors will begin to come to the fore, especially as ontario contemplates further tax hikes over the next few years this may be exacerbated in any breakup scenario if other provinces were to pressure ontario to take an uncompromising stance _ and one counter to its own self-interest _ toward quebec combined with the earlier comments about the province competitiveness, the choice for ontario would be to trigger this self-interest or face a hemorrhaging of economic activity toward the south in other words, at what point would looking south or asserting its dominance in the federation make a lot more sense for ontario than looking west and (leapfrog-style) looking east? or, if the focus is still east-west, at what point would ontario insist that the interregional transfer system become effectively emasculated or ''americanized'' _ presumably with support on this issue from alberta and british columbia?
note that the message here is not that ontario and roc generally do not desire to constitute or reconstitute a new canada no doubt they do rather, the underlying message is that the march of events on the economic front might be such as to overwhelm the values that bind canadians in roc together   asterik-bullet here
i want to attempt to make the case that renewed federalism can be a first-best option
there are several strands to the analysis, not all of which can be elaborated in appropriate detail foremost among these is to recognize that quebec ''demands'' constitute two quite separate thrusts the first is the desire for enhanced powers, largely but not exclusively, in the area of ''demolinguistics'' _ immigration, language, and culture _ along with more powers in the areas of communications, postsecondary education, skills training, unemployment insurance, regional development, and research and development
these are the issues with which canadians in roc are preoccupied, since they likely imply a reworking of the division of federal-provincial powers within confederation
the second thrust _ which really dominates the allaire report (of quebec governing liberal party) _ is that the global economic community is passing canada by the canadian federation is faltering economically it is too ''entangled'' in some areas, unable at the federal level to control deficits, poorly structured in terms of the relationship of the bank of canada to the federal government, canadians are overgoverned, and on and on quebec, on the other hand, perceives itself _ perhaps wrongly _ as a ''winner'' on the economic front over the s and wants to be part of a federation that, at the centre, also acts in ways that allow canadians to ''win'' in this sense, quebec challenge to roc is to reconstitute itself _ along with quebec _ in a manner consistent with benefiting from the ongoing and inevitable globalization, rather than fighting rearguard skirmishes that leave canada falling behind its trading partners as i noted at the beginning of this study, this is the ''opportunity'' aspect of the ongoing challenge _ an opportunity for all canadians to rethink and restructure how, as a society, they ought to position themselves in the emerging global reality
canadians in roc will go a long way toward addressing quebec overall demands if they can respond to this economic challenge indeed, part of the distance has been travelled already in a sense, aspects of the quebec challenge began to be addressed, at long last, in the two most recent federal budgets _ for example, public sector wages have been capped, spending guidelines will be legislated, and the federal debt and deficit issue has been joined with the proceeds of the goods and services tax to be devoted to debt servicing   
for quebec    exit scenarios are quite inferior to a reconstituted federal system in which the province would achieve some greater powers, particularly in terms of what falls under the rubric of ''demolinguistics''
for roc, the conclusion is similar: a reconstituted or renewed federalism is the first-best option from an economic vantage point, and there is ample flexibility in terms of the instruments that are available to replicate virtually any structure that could come about from an independent roc
for canadians generally, this moment represents an enormous opportunity quebec has alerted us to the need to restructure on the economic front in order to regain canada former competitive edge in the global economy on the political and constitutional front, my plea is that canadians begin to recognize that, as the second-largest federal nation in the world, canada diversity and complexity is only natural if it is quebec that feels economically and culturally constrained within canada in the s, then in the first decade of the st century it could be british columbia that will want greater freedom and greater powers as it becomes more integrated with the pacific rim if we cannot accommodate quebec in  then we probably will not be able to accommodate the western provinces in  what we are addressing on the political and constitutional front, then, is really the way in which a regionally distinct but value similar federation ought to evolve in the face of a rapidly changing global economic framework

""""it's frightening to see small towns becoming the targets of hate groups,"""" said the president of the guelph and district labour council """"fascism started in small towns and the education system we need to address the rise of the right and bust the myths they spread""""
earlier this year, the -year-old, who is of russian and irish descent, enrolled in a workshop held by the migrant rights network, a national anti-racism alliance that aims to help communities stand up against racism and the far right in the run-up to the federal election, when immigration and refugees are expected to be a wedge issue
formed last december to put migrant issues on the agenda for the oct  election, the alliance began canvassing migrant groups about the issues they were most concerned about
almost everyone cited their fear of rising racism and xenophobia in canada and asked for assistance in pushing back against the spread of far-right ideologies the alliance spent months developing training materials including a video and a tool kit, and since april has delivered more than  workshops training hundreds of volunteers - affiliated with unions, charities and community groups - from squamish, bc, to st john's, nl
the aim is to have them reach out to their local communities and have conversations with family, friends and colleagues about immigration and refugee issues, armed with the facts on policies to counter myths fuelled by propaganda
the network has organized rallies across the country, including a number on labour day, and begun monitoring candidates' campaign rhetoric and calling out those they feel are misinforming the public with racist and anti-immigrant comments a newsletter will be distributed to people who sign up to support the alliance's work to keep them informed on issues and concerns raised during the campaign
karen cocq, the alliance's education co-ordinator, said political parties and politicians, to consolidate their support base, often draw attention away from their own policy failures and point fingers at """"the others,"""" such as migrants
instead of blaming migrants for straining government services and pushing down wages, said cocq, people should be asking politicians why they cut budgets and fail to properly protect workers with decent wages
""""we understand people are anxious about their future, about the economy and try to make sense of the problems they face we want to focus on this climate of anxiety that allows scapegoating in our society,"""" cocq said
""""we try to provide everyday folks the tools they need to understand what's going on and not get fooled by those who use racism to divide us""""
ottawa climate activist katie rae perfitt of our time, a campaign that engages young people to push for a new green deal in the upcoming election, said her volunteers often hear canadians raising issues about migration when they are canvassing about climate change
born and raised in a farming community in the ottawa valley, perfitt said far-right groups exploit the fears of people who worry for the future of their children, about jobs being taken away and migrants being a drain on existing government services and the health-care system
recently, she was canvassing on sparks st, a pedestrian mall in downtown ottawa, when she struck up a conversation with an older man about climate change and the chat quickly turned to the influx of asylum seekers in canada via the united states land border over the past two years
""""we really clicked talking about climate change and the political action needed it caught me off guard when he started talking about what he thought of the people who crossed the border,"""" the -year-old recalled """"i realized i had to pull out my migrant tool box""""
perfitt started asking the man about his source of information and presenting him with the facts that refugees have the legal right to seek asylum here, and trying to calm his fear that canada has lost control of its border """"we did not agree  per cent, but we were able to centre our values, have a conversation and push back some of that fear,"""" she said
folk-dawson said these conversations can be hard because it's much easier for people to point at someone else for causing their miseries """"a debate of facts is not a debate of opinions we try to help people work through their feelings and experience to alleviate their fear
""""it can be uncomfortable and confrontational,"""" said folk-dawson, adding that even union supporters are susceptible to the myths that migrants are stealing jobs and pushing down wages
in june, she was handing out flyers at the university of guelph when a businessman in his s started complaining to her that border-crossing asylum seekers were queue-jumpers and immigrants were straining the health-care system
she explained to him that those refugees really have no queue to jump because they are ineligible for any immigration program and that migrants do contribute to canada's tax base, but often have limited access to government services

in economic issues, the small business development bank has been assisting ethnic minority small business owners and is finally providing some basic information in languages other than english and french
job creation in canada is primarily in the small business sector and the majority in this sector are ethnic minorities and immigrants - so it's only logical that this agency should become a tad multilingual
on the law and order front, the solicitor-general's department and the rcmp have increased their efforts on hate crimes their work in matters of diversity training for police officers is noteworthy
the justice department has been working with women's groups to overcome the scourge of female genital mutilation, and has been supporting the development of legal education materials in various languages so that newcomers can be fully informed
in the cultural field, where the richness of our evolving diversity is gradually catching on, there is evidence of movement on various fronts
at the forefront among the national museums is the canadian museum of civilization in hull, which has a large section focusing on contribution of particular ethnic groups
the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission deals with a range of licence applications for multicultural and/or multilingual radio and tv stations the cbc has explored minority issues in major current affairs shows, but has been less successful with its entertainment programming
among the most responsive agencies are health canada, human resources development and of course, citizenship and immigration
entering the field are the likes of environment canada, the canada council and the international development agencies even national defence is putting all its personnel through a program called sharp - standard for harassment and anti-racism prevention so racism and sexism in the armed forces will soon be history yup!
anyhow, the department that has the poorest report surprisingly, is foreign affairs and international trade canada either they still don't get the connection between canadian diversity and our trade and diplomatic advantage, or they didn't bother to send in a good overview
with several hundred initiatives - some great and some pathetic, i still find this annual report one of the most informative documents on how our national institutions are interpreting and responding to the growing cultural and racial diversity of the country
let me be clear i'm not saying nirvana is here nothing like it maybe nirvana will never be here but i sorely wish the debate would rage about whether or not this report deserved an a or an f, rather than the hysterical debate that some folks so successfully drag us into

2442778814,Blame game isn't helping us fight this virus,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the second coming of covid is here though it appears to have made a loitering stop in peel, put its feet up, made itself at home
while ontario braces itself for coronavirus: the sequel, either woefully unprepared for another round of contagion or prophylactically buffered, depending on who you trust - doctors or politicians - the region of peel has already borne the brunt of a revisit if, in fact, it could be said that covid- ever left, to the level of stage  unshackling, which only happened on july 
peel is a diverse and varied sprawl, from caledon, where more than  per cent of the population has been in canada for three generations or more - as per the most recent census,  - to brampton, where  per cent of the population are visible minorities overall,  per cent of peel residents were born in india,  per cent are immigrants and  per cent of immigrants call mississauga home
is any of that data relevant to the alarming figures disclosed by dr monica hau, peel's associate medical officer of health, at a press conference last week? probably, although statistics don't particularly provide any perspective more insightful than a surface contour, a topography
but the city of , northwest of toronto, less than half the size of toronto, had more active cases of covid- reported than any other public-health unit in the province according to figures as of last wednesday -  - scaling heights over last week not seen since june, with about three-quarters of the new infections diagnosed in brampton as of tuesday, cumulative active cases in peel were , according to public health ontario
part of that spike - at least  cases - is connected to a major workplace outbreak, the whence of it kept under wraps by peel public health officials, who take the view that it serves no purpose to identify the source that's a regrettable posture; the public has a right to know if there's a point of origin just up the street treating covid- like a taint, rather than the generally random illness it is, only promotes a sense of stigma, even shame
and lord knows there was plenty of shaming on social media - attached to culture, ethnicity and practices to every immigrant wave that has settled in canada - when the peel statistics were publicized among those who took understandable offence to the instant stereotyping was one naheed dosani, who tweeted: """"brampton is now the epicenter of ontario's #covid crisis rather than racial gaslighting south asians, poc & those in multigenerational homes, let's try to learn how people's vulnerabilities are shaped by their circumstances""""
dr dosani is a palliative care physician and health justice activist who founded palliative education and care for the homeless (peach)
""""i wrote that tweet because it was very apparent, looking at comments on social media and also the way it was being discussed in the media, that there seemed to be a description of a kind of people that were behaving in a certain way that was contributing to covid-,"""" dosani tells the star """"there are a lot of assumptions in how south asians and people of colour live differently in a higher concentration like region of peel, how they behave""""
it was surely not the intention of peel public health to stereotype any community however, there was an attempt made by both officials and media to explain the numbers, the apparent contributing factors, and this narrative reinforced an aspect of blame - particularly the takeaway that the coronavirus was being spread, to some extent, by people living in multi-generational households and individuals who'd travelled to severely struck countries such as india (second highest number of cases globally,  million, a jump of almost , cases within a -hour period on friday) and pakistan
visiting family in ancestral countries is hardly exclusive to south asians sloppy behaviour can't be assessed racially or ethnically
still, as a contributing factor, it can't be ignored - with  per cent of peel's covid cases (from february to september) in brampton, with an infection rate of  per , people while neighbouring mississauga has seen just  infections per , people
data is easily exploited which is why collecting race-related statistics is such a dicey proposition we did already know, however, from data gathered by toronto public health, that covid is taking a disproportionate toll on racialized and low-income groups in that context, the coronavirus does discriminate
""""often people who are living in these communities are working, they're using public transport, they're living in multi-generational homes, because it's a way to cope with their finances and take care of their relatives,"""" says dosani """"yes, there are cultural factors at play but people are jumping to conclusions about other people's behaviour, as if they are in control of all aspects of their behaviour certainly they're responsible for their own personal behaviour, but they're not responsible for the structural factors around them""""
last month, peel published a report, social determinants of health: race and occupation, which showed that, while visible minorities make up  per cent of peel's population, they made up  per cent of the region's covid- cases over-represented race categories were south asian, black and latino
but look a little deeper and there are more telling factors the three most frequently reported occupations among positive cases (from those who disclosed that information) were: health jobs ( per cent of cases), trade, transport and equipment operators ( per cent), and manufacturing and utilities ( per cent)
for the most part, these are occupations that have to keep working during the pandemic, that have been deemed essential or were never permitted - if they wanted to retain a salary - to lay down their tools of the trade
there are doubtless cultural factors involved in some community transmissions - large wedding celebrations and the same kind of reckless young adult gatherings seen everywhere else in the gta
but, although there's scant hard data, it's fairly obvious this is a demographic that couldn't lock itself down and in, that continued reporting as personal support health-care workers, often using public transit, continued to labour in construction industries, and that may not have the luxury of home-schooling their kids - although it should be noted that , students last week switched from in-person to online learning at peel public schools, bringing the total number of students signed up in peel to , one brampton high school and one catholic secondary school in peel had reported a positive test for covid- as of monday

2669259865,Tougher language law passes in Quebec; Limits english use,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the legislation almost all aspects delves into almost all aspects of the daily lives of quebecers: from who has access to english schools, to what language is spoken in the workplace and even the name of an electoral riding
what's more, bill  includes the built-in use of the constitution's notwithstanding clause overriding individual rights to shield it from endless court challenges, which opponents are promising anyway
on tuesday, the national assembly passed bill  by a vote of  to 
the yes votes came from the governing coalition avenir québec and the québec solidaire
liberal members of the national assembly voted against the bill, as did those with the parti québécois - for completely different reasons while the liberals say bill  goes too far and tramples the rights of minorities, the pq says it does not go far enough to protect french
the lone mna for the conservative party of quebec also voted against it the party objects to the bill's use of the notwithstanding clause
premier francois legault told reporters after the vote that the law is moderate, striking a balance between the positions of the liberals and the pq
prime minister justin trudeau said earlier in the day that he has concerns about the effect of the bill on quebec's english-speaking minority
the bill limits the use of english in the courts and public services and imposes tougher language requirements on small businesses of  or more employees and municipalities it requires immigrants to communicate with the government in french after they've been in the province for at least six months, caps enrolment at english-language junior colleges, known as cegeps, and increases the number of french courses students at the colleges must take
the government has given itself a year following adoption of the bill to present new language policy directives for all government ministries and agencies those directives will determine the specifics of how to apply the law
in recent weeks, thousands of quebecers protested the legislation for impeding the rights of anglophones, allophones and indigenous communities
a growing chorus of quebec legal experts has warned that there is little in the bill that clearly guarantees continued rights to health care and social services in english
""""to say there's nothing here to worry about doesn't seem to me to reflect what people are seeing in the text of the legislation,"""" robert leckey, dean of the faculty of law at mcgill university, said in an interview last week
""""does any other province forbid a german-speaking doctor and a german-speaking patient, or a german-speaking social worker and a german-speaking client  from speaking in a language in which they could best communicate? that's what i'm concerned about""""
a group of lawyers intends to fight the law, despite the use of the notwithstanding clause, which shields it from charter challenges
""""we will  address the international tribunals, the united nations human rights committee,"""" human rights lawyer julius grey told ctv news
bill  is """"the most gratuitous use of power i've ever seen,"""" he said
the quebec minister responsible for the french language, simon jolin-barrette, has described the bill as a matter of """"quebec pride""""
its adoption is another identity item checked off the caq's to do list after laws banning public servants from wearing religious symbols and instituting a quebec values test that wouldbe immigrants need to pass to become permanent residents
the minister rapidly tried to make political points off the pq's nay vote in a few months the caq and pq will be fighting for the same francophone nationalist votes in the oct  provincial election
""""the pq is allying itself with the liberal party of quebec,"""" jolin-barrette said after learning the pq would oppose the bill """"i no longer recognize the pq they are abandoning the french language for purely partisan calculations
""""quebecers know the only political party they can count on to defend the french language is the caq we have shown it""""
the pq, however, was not ready to play ball
""""we cannot condone something that is misleading, to say the least,"""" pq leader paul st-pierre plamondon told reporters at a news conference
""""this bill will not reverse the decline of french in quebec and we propose much stronger measures that would

Mississauga, Scarborough, Markham and Richmond Hill each have several Chinese malls. Only Durham Region doesn't boast a large Chinese population. While her remarks were sharply criticized by Chinese and non-Chinese alike, the debate over the growing Chinese communities is not limited to non-Chinese.","(story appears in mississauga edition on ms and in north york-york region edition on ny)
they've come here like so many immigrants before them with the dream of a better life for themselves and their children
some arrived several decades ago, others have only been here for a few months
but they share a common bond, whether they hail from hong kong, taiwan, china, singapore or elsewhere in asia: the conviction that canada is the best place in the world
however, as more and more chinese settle in the gta - the community is estimated at , - they have attracted attention
new asian malls have sprung up with brightly colored signs, and huge clusters of chinese communities have taken over what were once mostly middle-class white areas debates have begun on cultural insensitivity and discrimination
canada has seen several waves of chinese immigration
the first group came in the mid-s as part of the gold rush, followed by those who arrived to build the canadian pacific railway in the s
but restrictions were placed on the chinese, in the form of a ``head tax'' and then a law in  which excluded them from the country; the law was repealed in  but restrictions on chinese immigration were not entirely removed until 
in the s, another wave of immigrants arrived, mostly from hong kong, and since , perhaps the largest and most successful group to date has arrived
for years, chinatown was contained in a small four-block radius around dundas st w and spadina ave, but now, as more and more chinese have moved to the suburbs, so too have the stores and businesses that cater to them
mississauga, scarborough, markham and richmond hill each have several chinese malls only durham region doesn't boast a large chinese population
perhaps the biggest recent uproar occurred when markham deputy mayor carole bell openly suggested last summer that these malls were bringing too many chinese to the neighborhood, squeezing out other longtime residents
while her remarks were sharply criticized by chinese and non-chinese alike, the debate over the growing chinese communities is not limited to non-chinese
because the chinese community is split among newcomers, earlier immigrants and those born here, naturally there is no single perspective for chinese canadians
some have spoken out vehemently against development, while others have quietly opted not to live where other chinese gather
peter leung, a nine-year resident of richmond hill who grew up in downtown toronto chinatown, has been fighting several mall projects in his neighborhood near bayview and blackmore aves
for him, it a matter of bad planning
``i don't mind to have malls as long as they won't degrade our community,'' leung says, pointing out than many chinese oppose these developments
he wishes asian malls were better managed, in terms of garbage removal, obeying loading rules and parking concerns he worries that non- chinese will feel unwelcome
already in his own neighborhood, leung says when a house is listed for sale, ``there a  per cent chance the person coming through will be chinese
``i don't know why non-chinese people don't even bother to look at the house, they just don't
``i want my kids to grow up in a diverse community if my daughter school were  per cent chinese, i would move my daughter out,'' leung says, recalling that when he was a kid his classes were half chinese and half portuguese
``i want to see a good mix, for my kids to learn about other values, cultures''
tom chen, a real estate agent who works in north york and scarborough, thinks there are too many asian malls but just this month workers have broken ground on a new complex - metro square in markham - that will cater to taiwanese immigrants
he admits that the market is probably saturated, but the new mall on steeles ave e near warden ave will give those from taiwan ``a place of their own'' because hong kong immigrants make up the majority, some taiwanese feel alienated, he says
chen says claims that entire subdivisions are being marketed exclusively to chinese buyers in taiwan or hong kong is false
``the buyers just happen to be chinese,'' he says ``new houses are open to everybody if you can pay, you can buy''
when richard ong, a newspaper executive in singapore, returned to canada last december after a -year absence, he chose to settle in mississauga lorne park area
the toronto that he knew and loved in the s had disappeared the city now seems run down and ridden with crime, he says ``somehow it isn't the same any more''
during his years in asia, ong read stories from canada about new immigrants tearing down houses and ripping up old trees to build newer and bigger houses
he is sensitive to how some may feel about the pace of change, bu t says differences will work themselves out with time and better communication
``there no right or wrong here,'' he argues
``it a conflict between two expectations for hong kong people it such a waste with land being so expensive in hong kong,'' he says ``a square foot of land is worth its weight in gold they maximize land use
``but for canadians, you can't put value on having a tree, a garden it contributes to the ambience of the surroundings of the entire neighborhood people in hong kong don't think they are doing anything wrong''
ong says it a shame to hear that some canadians, albeit a minority, resent the new canadians who arrive with financial security and strong skills - unlike the earlier waves of poor immigrants who struggled for years
``this is good for the economy,'' he says ``they do not come here to accept welfare or government handouts''
and to the charge that chinese ``ghettos'' have sprung up in the suburbs, ong argues newcomers - rightly or wrongly - feel more secure with their own kind
he points to toronto long history of thriving ethnic areas ``italians congregate poles congregate the jews congregate,'' he argues ``if you look further down the road,  years from now, the street in scarborough that has all chinese people may be gone''
and for many chinese families, the decision about where to live may be out of concern for their elderly parents, who at  or  may find learning a new language difficult
``i have friends who would love to live elsewhere because their english proficiency is excellent,'' ong says ``they stay there to enable their mother to go shopping, to be with friends parents don't drive
``children are expected to be filial sometimes it not by choice that they choose to live in chinatown (or other heavily chinese areas),'' he says
yvonne chiu, vice-president culture and education of the chinese cultural centre of greater toronto, agrees that watching new immigrants buy up businesses and real estate would make some people uneasy
``of course, it would displease people but as a true torontonian, canadian, i would want my city to be vibrant''
but we should be thankful for the different immigrant cycles that have revitalized our economy through the years, she says
``as long as they are buying our vacant offices and shops, i don't care if they come from outer space, if they keep our economy going''
while some people have suggested that tensions between old immigrants and newcomers are rising, chiu disagrees
she stresses that the chinese community isn't one monolithic block any tensions or small misconceptions come from not understanding each other language
for chinese speakers, the dialects are many and even if you are fluent in cantonese, that doesn't mean you'll understand a single word of mandarin, taiwanese or hakka
chiu believes education is key to resolving perceived misunderstandings both inside and outside the chinese community
that is one of the main reasons the community has launched a campaign to build a new $ million centre at markham rd and sheppard ave e in scarborough to share the chinese culture with others
``we feel that some of us are lucky enough to have a bilingual education, to have a foot in both worlds''
and with the handover of the british colony of hong kong to mainland china looming in , the chinese here must remember this is home now
``pretty soon the chinese community may not have a hong kong to return to,'' she says ``we must say we are canadians first''
others like victor oh, a director with the mississauga chinese business association, are upset by criticism over the flood of asian investors
``in the recession, we were the only businesses actively growing the chinese who come here are willing to take risks,'' he says, adding many businesses have pumped money into the local economy
he points to small businesses that have sprouted up in mississauga and the opening of golden square, a three- building shopping complex that opened on central parkway west near burnhamthorpe rd w
people often forget that it the small businesses that keep an economy growing and thriving, he says
oh acknowledges that some people may be envious when they see newcomers with their ``flashier'' lifestyle that canadians aren't accustomed to but, he says, people need to remember that when you see young people with their gold visa cards, driving bmws and mercedes, they are often living here on their own
``a lot of parents are shuttling between hong kong and here,'' he says ``they want to give them they best that they can,'' since they can't be with them
he suggests any misunderstandings can be easily overcome with more integration and education oh suggests that telling newcomers about the importance of engaging in chitchat or small pleasantries would go a long way toward bridging differences
``it important to learn how to live like a canadian,'' he says simply by saying ``good morning,'' or chatting about the weather in an elevator would make others feel more at ease
whatever the future holds, discrimination has already taken its toll on businessman steven hon, owner of art deco at market village in markham
hon said he brought his wife and their two children to markham from hong kong two years ago, but the life he had hoped for, and dreamed of, has not come true
he cannot understand why immigrants like himself - the entrepreneurs who have started businesses here - aren't welcomed with open arms
``we work, we pay taxes,'' hon says ``we are part of this country development
``(yet) we feel like second-class citizens you don't have a voice''
he points to the chinese shops in market village at kennedy rd and steeles ave e, saying it was once unused land but now it has been developed
perhaps, he suggests, immigrants with money - despite canadian government immigration policies that actively seek them out - are now feared
``canadians are afraid that we will control the economic power they don't believe in themselves they are scared that the chinese will become a powerful group''
as a result, he feels subtle discrimination, some of it perhaps brought on by language barriers
but it shouldn't be the case, he says
``this land is huge, people are few it like a united nations people are from everywhere''
however, with a hint of sadness, hon openly acknowledges that there a good chance he and his family will eventually leave canada and perhaps settle elsewhere in asia

one of naheed nenshi's favourite phrases has been that he can't think in sound bites - even saying his name takes longer than  seconds
it's a name that is now being hollered at him from passing cars and with it a recognition that has people running across the street to shake his hand and pat his back
civic politics in calgary has been mainly a straightforward affair few surprises low turnouts but nenshi's campaign, which got a late burst of energy, did something unusual it changed perceptions from outsiders of what kind of city calgary was and who calgarians really were, and his campaign motivated voters to head to the polls
he won with  per cent of the vote, handily beating his two closest competitors, a high-profile alderman and a former news anchor, both heavily favoured to win voter turnout at  per cent was the highest it's been in four decades

Nguon believes that isn't the case any more. Quebec newsrooms, especially television stations that want to attract immigrant viewers, will have to look for visible minorities if they want to compete for advertising dollars, she says. One station that has already started doing that is Quatre-Saisons in Montreal. It made Quebec television history in 1986 when it hired the first black to report in French. It now has five visible minorities working on-air.","  second in a three-part series monday: a newspaper takes action

""""they were convinced i couldn't speak a word of french,"""" says nguon, who spent five years in france during her youth
just as quebec's language problems confront nguon on the job, they also contribute to keeping visible minorities like her from working in quebec newsrooms
french-language news directors and editors in quebec readily admit they lag seriously behind english media when it comes to hiring not only visible minorities, but any ethnic reporters at all
to explain the lag, one has to look at the history of language in the province while francophones remained cloistered until the s quiet revolution, most immigrants joined quebec's english community
decades behind
that has left francophones decades behind in integrating immigrants newsrooms reflect that but the province is trying to catch up, using language laws like bill , because immigrants are seen as one way for quebec to survive in an english north america, experts say
andre breton, head of the undergraduate communications program at the universite du quebec a montreal, says most television or radio stations are worried they will lose their audience if they put unfamiliar faces or accents on the air
only dyed-in-the-wool quebeckers worked for the sensationalist journal de montreal, the intellectual le devoir and the influential le point, the french equivalent to cbc's the national, a  study showed
when it comes to visible minorities in any quebec newsroom, they can usually be counted on the fingers of one hand
members of visible minorities made up one per cent of francophone newsrooms though their communities make up seven per cent of montreal -- where most quebec media are based, the  study found
while editors and news directors say they want visible minorities on staff, little is being done except by some innovators in the younger medium of television media bosses blame obstacles they can't overcome when explaining why policies to recruit visible minorities aren't working
one is that job turnover in quebec's small newspaper market is low, giving editors little chance to hire visible minorities la presse and le journal hire one or two reporters a year
another is that immigrants to the province traditionally gravitated towards the anglophone community and don't have the language skills
that's no excuse, says andre noel, president of the province's journalists association, the federation professionelle des journalistes du quebec
""""media efforts are below those of other groups we criticize, like the police,"""" says the la presse reporter
noel is certain the lack of visible minorities on staff has led to biased reporting
a recent example of questionable coverage was debated in montreal media circles after police killed an armed black man in a nightclub
while feeling was running high, the le journal's huge front-page headlines quoted a member of the black community who vowed to execute the next officer who killed a black other media followed suit
the tabloid was roundly criticized for using the man, who wasn't a community leader, for cheap headlines
raymond tardif, the le journal's editor-in-chief, says the story was legitimate because police took the threats seriously and it showed the strong feelings in the black community after the april shooting
""""if it was a black reporter who got the story, i don't think it would have changed much""""
fo niemi, executive director of the montreal-based centre for research action on race relations, says le journal branded all blacks as troublemakers """"who are going out to get the skins of police officers""""
while the anglophone media is supposed to be more advanced than their francophone counterparts, the montreal gazette has five visible minorities out of  reporters, photographers and editors
""""our record is pretty dismal,"""" executive managing editor mel morris admits
he says it is hard to find candidates who are bilingual in an effort to hire more, the gazette would choose a visible minority reporter over a white reporter who might be  per cent more qualified, says morris
the anglophone community has worked hard for decades to integrate minorities so it is natural to see them working as reporters, says nguon, a federation vice-president in charge of an intern program to get visible minorities into newsrooms
francophones, who have insulated themselves until recently, are just learning the ropes, she adds
""""i can't say quebeckers are more closed or racist,"""" says nguon """"they just didn't think blacks or asians would work for the interests of quebec""""
nguon believes that isn't the case any more quebec newsrooms, especially television stations that want to attract immigrant viewers, will have to look for visible minorities if they want to compete for advertising dollars, she says
one station that has already started doing that is quatre-saisons in montreal it made quebec television history in  when it hired the first black to report in french it now has five visible minorities working on-air
at the time, competitors like radio-canada and tele-metropole were saying audiences weren't ready for visible minorities on television

He believes sovereigntists would accept Quebec remaining part of Canada as long as Quebecers were recognized as a people, and Quebec as a nation, albeit within Canada.

quebec negotiated a series of special deals with ottawa in the 's, 's and 's, before the trudeau era
the thinking behind these special deals, argues montreal political scientist guy lachapelle, could hold the key to future reconciliation between quebec and the rest of canada
it's a hopeful comment, coming from a sovereigntist with ties to the parti quebecois (lachapelle distinguishes between ``sovereigntists'' who desire ties with canada and ``separatists'' who don't fret about such things)
lachappelle, who teaches at concordia university, says the question facing canadians in : ``can canada go back to being a flexible federation?''
lachapelle wants us to embrace quebec as ``a nation within a nation'' he believes sovereigntists would accept quebec remaining part of canada as long as quebecers were recognized as a people, and quebec as a nation, albeit within canada
it's a convoluted concept but then, quebec's relationship with canada has been convoluted for some time
since the early 's' quebec has been collecting provincial income taxes through an agency known as revenue quebec quebecers fill out separate federal and provincial forms and remit two sets of taxes in this way, quebec maintains a measure of fiscal autonomy and sets its own deductions
by contrast, other provinces have taxes collected on their behalf by revenue canada ottawa subsequently sends the various provincial treasuries their share each province sets its own tax level as a percentage of the federal rate
quebec, since , has operated its own pension system -- the quebec pension plan quebec wants to invest quebecers' pension funds in its own economy and to use the investments to encourage companies to put more francophones on their boards of directors the qpp gives quebec a degree of monetary clout and automony for instance, at the time of the last referendum, pension funds were used to buy canadian dollars to maintain the loonie's value
the other provinces have opted to participate in the cpp to save administration costs
a unique deal
in the 's, quebec negotiated with the feds a unique deal on immigration quebec has a say over its independent-class immigrants, although ottawa controls the intake of family- and refugee-class immigrants who make up  per cent of those entering the province
some assert that the immigration power is being used by quebec for political reasons -- to cut back on newcomers who might vote no in a future referendum but others insist it's a social tool -- to give quebec power to ensure newcomers speak french or are integrated as francophones
quebec is the only canadian province with a minister of international relations the post was created in the 's other provinces have intergovernmental affairs ministers but only the federal government has a foreign affairs minister
quebec has offices in toronto, vancouver, ottawa and moncton quebec has what it calls ``delegations'' to promote trade, tourism and cultural exchanges -- in london, paris, new york, tokyo, mexico and brussels it closed five delegations in the us last year for financial reasons intriguingly, france grants quasi-diplomatic privileges to quebec's paris office!
lachapelle notes that quebec now wants more special deals, in the area of telecommunications, manpower training and language and culture
he does not think it's possible to achieve flexible federalism-type deals with a liberal government led either by jean chretien or paul martin he says, from the sovereigntist perspecive, the federal leader currently exhibiting the most co-operative attitude is tory jean charest
the problem for the rest of us, of course, is where do all these flexible federalism arrangements ultimately lead? and at what point does ``a nation within a nation'' become a nation outside a nation?

on jan  the estonian legislature passed a law making estonian the republic's official language and relegating russian to an inferior position not only must all shops and government offices now provide a complete service in estonian, but on all publicly displayed signs russian must follow estonian _ in the same or smaller print
i don't know the estonian for ''deja vu,'' but the french-canadians of quebec have been passing harsher language laws than this for a long time in the name of protecting french and what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
the million estonians are a miniscule fraction of the soviet union's  million people, and it has not traditionally been a very democratic country the five million french-speaking quebeckers, by contrast, are a fifth of canada's population, and canada is both democratic and genuinely federal so they are free to do whatever they like _ including leave, if they do not get their way
there was therefore no serious resistance by ottawa in  when quebec nationalists stripped english of its historic status as a co-equal official language in quebec, banned the language from public signs, and required every child who could not document his status as a hereditary member of quebec's english-speaking minority to attend school in french
now estonian nationalists are taking some cautious steps in the same direction, and a lot of people who deplore the intolerance of the quebec government will applaud the estonians is there a double standard here?
in both cases, the real focus of the nationalists' concern is not the hundreds of millions of russian- or english-speakers beyond their borders, but the minority of less than a million that lives in their midst
the numbers elsewhere only matter in the sense that they make english or russian enormously powerful and attractive languages (this is clearly a bigger problem for estonian than for french, which is itself a world language) the nub of the problem, however, is that both quebec and estonia contain a minority of people who speak that deaded rival language at home _  per cent of quebec's population is english-speaking, and fully  per cent of estonia's speaks russian
estonia was unwillingly annexed to the soviet union less than  years ago the relatively huge russian minority now living there (very few of whom speak any estonian) is entirely the result of post-war immigration encouraged by moscow so the estonians are fully justified in demanding control over further immigration; they are on the verge of being swamped
they can also justify passing laws that in effect restrict the employment opportunities of existing russian immigrants who do not speak estonian if that makes some of the newcomers go home, the estonians won't mind a bit
quebec has armed itself with similar but more repressive language laws, and the francophone elite makes similar claims that the cultural survival of french-canadians is at stake but there is precious little evidence for that; quebec's english-speaking minority, which dates back two centuries as a significant element in the population, peaked at around  per cent in the late th century
it has been in slow but continuous decline ever since, and the decline has been accelerated by the harsh language legislation of the past two decades moreover,  per cent of quebec's remaining anglophones speak french and there is hardly any english-speaking immigration, while all other immigrants to quebec are compelled by law to send their children to french schools
the official quebec language agency predicted last year that the french-speaking proportion of the population will grow from  percent in  to  percent by  french-canadians have no objective reason to fear their politically meek anglophone minority, nor to envy it (francophone and anglophone average incomes in quebec are virtually identical)
that they do unnecessarily humiliate that minority, by treating its language as a communicable disease, is partly a reprisal for the maltreatment of the tiny and helpless french-speaking minorities in western canada but it is mainly disguised vindictiveness, justified psychologically by the ancestral anti-english mythology that almost all french-canadians imbibe from birth many of their grievances were once real, and unfortunately such grudges linger for generations in the popular memory
but french would be in no danger in quebec even if the language laws there treated the minority with more respect estonian really is in danger, and probably needs draconian legislation to save it the irony is that, being in the soviet union, the estonians may not be permitted to go that far

253726680,Hysteria now rules in Quebec:   [FINAL Edition ],"A demographic study was published in 1988 by the official Quebec language advisory agency, the Conseil de la langue francaise. It was carried out by demographers Marc Termote and Danielle Gauvreau (La Situation Demolinguistique du Quebec). In 1984, the Bureau de la Statistique du Quebec published a demographic study which projected the population of Quebec to the year 2,041. By then, a half century from now, the official government statisticians projected that Quebec will be 87 per cent French. They, too, see Quebec becoming more French as far as the informed eye can see.","ottawa - quebec is in the grip of a collective neurosis
from premier robert bourassa on down to citizens at the grassroots, a form of mass hysteria, of general delusion, has seized the population
the neurosis takes the form of an obsessive conviction, against all evidence, that french in quebec is threatened, french is fragile, french is so insecurely rooted in the minds, hearts, memories, imaginations, sensibilities, ears and tongues of quebecers that the slightest breeze will blow it all away
never mind that a higher proportion of quebecers use french in their daily lives and at home today than at any time since confederation
never mind that demographic projections show quebec becoming increasingly more french - in the sense that a higher proportion will have french as its mother tongue and home language in future than at present
never mind that quebec non-francophones are learning french at a rapid rate, and that more of them are able to speak french today than at any time in quebec history
no, all these objective facts have no more effect than straws in the wind against quebec current phobias irrational fears have become settled conviction they govern state policy
at his news conference last week, premier robert bourassa explained why he passed bill  banning all languages but french from outside commercial signs
""""you know that, if i had permitted bilingual signs everywhere in quebec, you know what would have happened,"""" he said, as though it were self-evident
""""what?"""" a reporter asked
""""french would have been threatened""""
the next day, giving a commentary on the radio network of radio-canada, novelist gilles archambault issued a dire warning
""""we are on the way to becoming a louisiana""""
becoming a louisiana means, as currently used, losing french as a viable language, with only a few flavors of it remaining at the margin or in remote areas to enchant the tourists
in a letter to the editor in la presse, a woman wrote that """"within  years"""" french would have disappeared from quebec
what factual basis is there for all these phobias? two realities
it is true that the birthrate of francophones - about  babies per woman in her lifetime - is below the replacement level of  babies it is also true that most non-french immigrants adopt english as most spoken official language
but these two realities are blown up to fantastic heights until they acquire invaders-from-mars dimensions frantic conclusions are drawn which are mere hallucinations
a demographic study was published in  by the official quebec language advisory agency, the conseil de la langue francaise it was carried out by demographers marc termote and danielle gauvreau (la situation demolinguistique du quebec)
their conclusion?
""""quebec is likely to see its share of the population of canada reduced but at the same time it will become more french""""
by the year ,, they project, quebec will make up  per cent of the population of canada, down from  per cent in 
but will french disappear?
""""if you assume that international migration and language transfers have a net impact of , the french-speaking share (of quebec population) will go from  per cent in  to  per cent in , and  per cent in ,""""
they think, though, that this assumption of no net impact from international migration and language transfers is too optimistic for french, so they make another assumption - that the impact of international migration and of language transfers will be in future exactly the same as during the five-year period between  and 
""""in this case, the francophone share would be  per cent in the year  and in ,  per cent""""
in other words, no matter how these demographers look at it, quebec will grow increasingly french to the last year of the forecast, ,
in , the bureau de la statistique du quebec published a demographic study which projected the population of quebec to the year ,
by then, a half century from now, the official government statisticians projected that quebec will be  per cent french they, too, see quebec becoming more french as far as the informed eye can see

but when bing choi bak died two decades ago, there were few to mark his passing fewer still were the photos or momentos to trace the threads of his proud heritage, woven (not always comfortably) into the canadian fabric
bing choi bak wouldn't have recognized metro chinese community today but his legacy - and those of many like him - are very much in evidence
metro has the largest chinese population in north america there are now four separate """"chinatowns,"""" each with a distinctive character; conversations criss-cross in several dialects and languages each reflects the many countries from which the chinese have come - the west indies, south america, southeast asia, taiwan and china
new immigrants from hong kong - currently canada largest single source of immigration - are helping to fast-track toronto transformation into an international business centre chinese canadians are making their mark in everything from science, music and the arts to business and human rights many are prosperous and upwardly mobile, living examples of the classic immigrant success story
but it wasn't always so fuelled by an unflinching work ethic and a collective strength, the history of the chinese in toronto has been one of struggle and determination that they will carve out a better life for their children, that """"tomorrow will always be better than yesterday""""
the first chinese arrived in canada almost  years ago; most were from the four counties in the pearl river delta area of guangdong province in southern china they were fleeing famine and political upheaval and had heard that north america was """"gum-san"""" - a """"gold mountain"""" and there was a tradition in that area of china of seeking opportunities overseas, sending money home to support relatives and eventually returning, if possible
thousands of chinese arrived in north america to join the california gold rush of  and then moved north to take part in the fraser river gold rush of 
they worked as gleaners, cooks, laundrymen, teamsters and merchants a few made their fortune, but many others failed and more than half of the original influx of about , returned to china
a second major wave of immigration took place less than  years later when the chinese were recruited to complete the canadian pacific railway between  and , , emigrated to canada, , of whom were employed by the railway, laboring under appalling conditions
initially, the chinese were welcomed they were seen as industrious, reliable and inexpensive - they usually received less than half the amount paid to white workers for the same work but when cheap labor was no longer needed, they were deemed a threat to the job security of white workers
many were forced across the rockies by anti-chinese sentiment; they rode across canada, over the bodies of chinese laborers who, it is said, """"died for every mile of track laid""""
the first chinese arrived in toronto before the turn of the century the first reference is in the toronto city directory of , which shows that sam ching ran a laundry at  adelaide st e
three other chinese laundries are listed in the directory of  - sam lee at  jarvis st, sam sing at  / queen st w and tan gee at  yonge st sam ching had moved to  adelaide st e in the  census, the total chinese population of ontario was , of whom  lived in toronto
hinese laundries were soon in demand and renowned for the """"fine hand-finish of their wash"""" by , there were at least  chinese laundries, a year later there were  and in  there were , seven of them on queen st w
some chinese laundries even offered pick-up and delivery services dr george lee, whose father and uncle ran a laundry at  yonge st, recalled going out at night with his father in  to pull an artillery cart along yonge st dropping off clean laundry other kids hauled clean clothes in their sleds, and in the summer, made deliveries by bicycle
being a small group had its advantages they were welcomed by missionary workers and such a strong friendship developed that by the s,  per cent of canada chinese christian population lived in ontario
almost from the start, the young men christian association offered english classes on may , , the ymca weekly bulletin from shaftesbury hall,  queen st w, said: """"it is probably unknown to most of our friends that a chinese class is held in our rooms every sabbath afternoon, at three o'clock mr d mclaren has been led of the lord to take a deep interest in this work, and has met with much encouragement in his labors""""
by the s, cooke presbyterian church taught english through its sunday school classes and a decade later, some  chinese were enrolled
while the churches were seeking converts to christianity, they aided the new immigrants in other ways, helping them adapt to a new culture and providing them with a base
the chinese christian association, better known as the young men christian institute (ymci), was the first chinese community founded in , it moved to  university ave in  and became a boarding house for an increasing number of visiting students from china, a meeting place for young people, a chinese school and a nursery school for neighborhood children
ernest c mark was invited from china to be principal of the school the rev ma tk wou, a graduate of the toronto bible college in , was the minister; converted to christianity as a boy, he had cut off his queue and had thrown it in the river as a sign of the strength of his faith
the ymci was an important social conduit but many social concerns were handled by tongs, which were clans and district associations membership was by family surname or according to the district of china from which they came they settled disputes, organized burials and had a credit system to provide the $ needed to start a laundry
such organizations were a tribute to the resourcefulness of the community and the determination to succeed they also reflect the unwillingness of canadian society to help these new immigrants
during the depression, for example, the government gave chinese canadians no meal tickets or welfare payments and the tongs set up their own welfare systems nevertheless, more than  chinese died of starvation
no sooner had the canadian pacific railway united the country than a volley of anti-chinese legislation emerged from every level of government on july , , the federal government passed the first act restricting the immigration of chinese into canada for the next  years, chinese immigrants had to pay the government a """"head tax"""" to enter the country from $ in , it was increased to $ on jan ,  on july , , it was raised to $ - today equivalent would be two full years' wages more than $ million was collected
but immigration continued and the federal government finally slammed the door shut with the chinese immigration act though few in number, chinese communities fought the legislation but it was rammed through with such speed that there was no time to solicit support from the larger community the act was introduced on july ,  for canadians, that was dominion day; for the chinese it became known as """"humiliation day""""
the intention of the act was to choke off the chinese community in canada, and chinese immigration came to a virtual standstill for  years; between  and , only  were admitted wives were separated from husbands, children from their parents; some , married men were separated from their families during this time
""""even though we were born here, we always felt like second-class citizens,"""" said daniel mah, son of the rev ma tk wou """"i never got over that feeling""""
despite challenges to the federal legislation, the """"exclusion act"""" stayed in place until may , , although restrictions were not completely removed until 
local governments were more benevolent but this did not stop the city from attempting to stop chinese restaurants and laundries from hiring white women in the s
chinese immigrants faced prejudice and bigotry from the start in toronto in december, , the labor congress pushed for immigration to be banned chinese """"could not be christianized, neither could they be civilized, nor assimilated to our civilization    the chinese forced the working people out of industries owing to the cheapness of their labor""""
one rainy night in october of the next year, workers in hamilton held an anti-chinese demonstration marchers carried chinese lanterns and slogans such as """"white men - patronize white laundries"""" and """"the chinese must go"""" unions such as the amalgamated engineers, painters, moulders, stonecutters and cigarmakers were represented but there were no major disturbances
the british columbia riots of september, , were far more serious more than , people took part in a march on vancouver chinatown rocks were thrown and shots were fired chinese people were injured and their properties destroyed
from the early days onwards, the chinese community grew steadily; by  the chinese population in toronto was almost , different types of businesses had sprung up; the first chinese restaurant seems to have been sing tom restaurant at  / queen st w in  a year later it was kong yee teas, one of several tea companies established during the early years of the century
the first known chinese area in toronto was along york st, south of wellington; redevelopment of this area from - forced a move to elizabeth st and the south side of queen st
the population was transient and the chinese were seen as """"sojourners"""" - temporary workers who never intended to stay it was a bachelor society, comprised almost entirely of men whose families had remained in china
few women emigrated; a wife was expected to stay at home, to care for the family and to look after her husband parents few families could afford the extra """"head-tax"""" and only the wealthy could afford the """"luxury"""" of a wife and family
ironically, the family is the focus of chinese life men and boys went overseas, sacrificing family life so that loved ones would not go hungry
men gathered to play mah-jong, fan-tan and cow poker (similar to dominoes) court cases reported in the toronto star also suggest there were problems due to gambling, prostitution and opium- smoking
for many, however, the church became the focal point of their lives sunday school was a major part of the week for the first generation of children to grow up canadian there were also the boy scouts and the canadian girls in training the event of the year was a community picnic in high park there were also church-arranged retreats at geneva park, bringing together chinese from ontario and the united states and jokingly referred to as """"marriage camps""""
chinatown restaurants were established on dundas, queen and yonge streets missionaries and some of the vaudeville actors who played at shea on bay st or at the casino on queen st used to eat at the jung wah at  / elizabeth st
restaurants outside the chinatown area served canadian-style dishes and a full-course meal cost only  cents
chinese canadians have always responded generously to appeals in , the ontario chinese patriotic association purchased two planes for china with money raised by subscription the star reported the planes would be used to train commercial pilots
when the sino-japanese war broke out in , rice-bowl festivals were held at convocation hall at the university of toronto to raise money for winter clothing and medical supplies for the soldiers bazaars and concerts were also organized
in world war ii, chinese canadians made their most dramatic contributions to both china and canada young men and women headed down to the recruiting centre at the cne grounds
""""it didn't occur to us that we couldn't vote,"""" recalled war veteran jim mah """"we just went down to enlist""""
chinese women sold war bonds and tags on the street, raising more than $ million and perhaps for the first time, the press began to give toronto chinese community a human face instead of being the anonymous subject of race legislation, stories focussed on chinese helping the war effort
when war ended in , toronto and other cities began to push for the repeal of the  """"exclusion"""" act chinese war veterans and activists spoke out, this time with considerable support from the non-chinese community
canada finally gave in, but not without international pressure china had been an ally during the war and now that canada was a member of the united nations, it had little choice but to reconsider the act
two years after war ended, the act was repealed and chinese and south asian canadians won the right to vote but it was too late to undo the harm the act had caused for decades more than , men had lived as married bachelors, travelling back and forth to china when they could and living apart from their familes for more than  years
it was a hard adjustment for elderly couples who had lived in different worlds for much of their adult lives mrs arthur lee, for example, had been separated from her husband when they were young when she finally arrived in toronto, it was to care for him in his old age
men who had remained single returned to china to find a bride but this created other problems, with young women married to men who were  or  years their senior
and although the act had been repealed, immigration restrictions still made it difficult for families to get together now recognized as canadians and confident in that role, the chinese community again lobbied ottawa for change
a delegation which included only one woman, jean lumb, pricked the conscience of the diefenbaker government """"it was just natural to have families together,"""" said lumb """"how dare they keep our families apart?""""
but despite their persistence, special regulations governing chinese and other asians remained in effect until the s
the community determination to carve out a distinctly canadian life manifested itself again when chinatown was threatened by bulldozers clearing the way for the new city hall chinatown was expected to disperse but metro chinese refused to move until homes and shops were relocated and a new community was established east of spadina
the new community flourished at first a collection of grocery stores and tourist shops, the new chinatown has been transformed into a commercial centre with increased educational opportunities, chinese canadians have moved into a variety of professions and businesses
language too has changed """"toi-san,"""" a county dialect of the early settlers, was replaced by cantonese because they did not understand the legacy of the chinese in canada, new immigrants referred to them as """"jook-sing"""" - a hollow piece of bamboo, with roots in neither canada nor asia
as the community grew and its needs became more complex, particular problems arose and many traditional organizations were unable to meet the needs of the new immigrants
among the new wave from hong kong was a younger, motivated and highly sophisticated group of professionals, many of them canadian- educated who were able to work on new community issues these new torontonians set out to deal with youth activities, english- language classes, training, legal aid, citizenship, human rights and labor issues and through organizations such as the mon sheong foundation, they are helping the elderly
community politics are also moving in step with the times during the s and s, the comunity fought for their rights as canadians the s emphasized multiculturalism pride in ethnic identity bolstered arguments for social programs and facilities
the s brought an urgency that has replaced the patient tolerance that characterized the older generations the turning- point was challenging the racist typecasting of chinese as foreigners on ctv w program a new era of advocacy was born and along with it, new community leaders in step with the social movements of the day, organizations such as the chinese canadian national council focused on promoting integration and equality of all canadians
ut canadian issues and concerns were pre-empted by the tiananmen square massacre of june ,  not since world war ii has china become such an obsession with toronto chinese community
without question, the struggle for human rights has been the bond that has galvanized metro chinese community since the start of the century it remains the undercurrent of change for a community that is now as diversified as it is stratified
equality is a key issue, whether it is the concern of the fifth- generation, canadian-born chinese who is barred from the boardroom or chinese immigrants from southeast asia who are readily exploited as cheap labor
because it is easier to believe that racism and discrimination are closed chapters, only a few are prepared to acknowledge that as chinese canadians, they still haven't quite """"made it""""
in reality, until the community is fully at home with the political system, economic and social gains mean little while canadian chinese have been elected to federal, provincial and local governments, history has shown that more political power is necessary to secure the community place in canadian society
today, the community is pouring its efforts into the yee hong villa, north america first comprehensive geriatric centre for chinese seniors, and the chinese cultural centre fundraising for these projects reaches beyond the community; at the same time they are helping to smooth out the friction that existed between the canadian-born and recent immigrants
in the span of a few generations, the community has made tremendous strides drawing on the determination and experiences of those who came before, metro chinese have shown they are ready and eager to make up for lost time and to excel
""""a decade ago, i wasn't as optimistic about the future of the community,"""" says dr joseph wong, a community leader """"but since then, many things have changed toronto has matured into a cosmopolitan centre it is a great city and i think the chinese community has played a vital role in making it this way our experience in toronto shows that ethnic groups can successfully maintain their cultural diversity and as canadians, we have learned to survive well""""

2201615107,U.S. eyes border deal with Canada:   Agreement could change the way asylum seekers make their claims,Aucun(e) disponible.,"canada and the united states are closer to renegotiating a border agreement that has governed the treatment of asylum claimants along the shared border for almost two decades
the us department of homeland security confirmed monday it has asked the state department for permission to negotiate amendments to the safe third country agreement, but did not say what changes it is seeking
under the agreement, asylum claimants must make their case to the first safe country they arrive in canada considers the us a safe country, which allows canadian border officials to turn back non-american asylum seekers who attempt to make claims at us border crossings into canada
there's a so-called """"loophole,"""" however: if prospective asylum claimants make it onto canadian soil outside a regular border checkpoint, they're entitled to have their claim assessed by the canadian government
approximately , """"irregular"""" migrants have crossed into canada that way since , coinciding with the trump administration's decision to crack down on illegal immigration and revoke deportation protections for a number of minority groups living in the us
bill blair, the minister of border security and organized crime, confirmed he has been speaking with us officials on how to address the loophole, but said there have been no formal negotiations between the two countries
""""i think there's a very important conversation now taking place between us and i think it's an opportunity for both countries to enhance, modernize and improve the agreement between us,"""" blair told the star on monday
""""i don't want to negotiate in the media, quite frankly, but there are good conversations taking place between us""""
irregular migration became a political flashpoint for the trudeau government, not just with opposition parties in ottawa but also with premier doug ford and toronto mayor john tory both ford and tory have called on the federal government to provide more resources to deal with the higher-than-usual number of refugee claimants who depend on provincial and municipal supports while their claims are assessed
in ottawa, the opposition conservatives have put pressure on the liberal government to close the loophole by making the principals of the safe third country agreement apply to the entire border the liberals have repeatedly said the government can't unilaterally amend an agreement with the united states
but within government, there's long been an acknowledgement that the  agreement has not been working as intended that was the message in a january  briefing note prepared for immigration minister ahmed hussen before a meeting with kristjen nielsen, the us secretary of homeland security, which was obtained by the canadian press
blair has been meeting with us lawmakers and security officials on the issue since he assumed the newly created role of minister of border security in , his office said
beyond the issue of irregular migration, it's not clear what other border issues are on the table if negotiations begin in earnest

after discussions with the ncc, the groups also agreed to add the phrase """"canada -- a land of refuge,"""" to recognize canada's role as a refuge for victims of oppressive regimes

The numbers do show, however, a void in programs and policies aimed at improving literacy skills of Canadians, said Jean Pignal, Statistics Canada's chief of culture, tourism and the centre for education statistics. More than 23,000 Canadians aged 16 and over participated in the survey, conducted in 2003. Participants were assessed on how well they performed in four areas: understanding text, documents such as graphs and charts, math concepts and problem-solving. The survey shows anglophones scored higher reading comprehension levels than francophones. Francophones outside Quebec who took the test in English also fared better than those who were assessed in French. Part of the difference is attributed to differences in education levels because in Quebec there were no significant differences between literacy skills of anglophones and francophones at each educational level.","western canadians have their eastern counterparts beaten when it comes to reading
british columbia, alberta, saskatchewan and the yukon have the country's highest literacy rates, according to a statistics canada survey released yesterday
but nearly half of all canadians aged  and over, or about  million people, lack the literacy skills to fully function in society, such as reading newspapers, instruction manuals or brochures
new brunswick, nunavut, and newfoundland and labrador have the highest percentage of residents who fail to meet basic reading comprehension requirements, the survey revealed
""""it's a phenomenally high number and most people won't even believe it,"""" said jim pollock, director of communications at abc canada literacy foundation
one of the survey's most surprising finds is that literacy levels in canada haven't improved since the last survey of its kind was done in  in both cases, two in five adults between  and  scored below the minimum literacy level needed to function in everyday life
experts had predicted that as older, less educated workers retired, post-secondary enrollment went up and the number of new immigrants with higher levels of education increased, so, too, would the country's average reading comprehension
but that wasn't the case, and experts are at a loss to explain exactly why the numbers do show, however, a void in programs and policies aimed at improving literacy skills of canadians, said jean pignal, statistics canada's chief of culture, tourism and the centre for education statistics

but outside quebec, francophones had lower reading comprehension levels than anglophones, regardless of education
while the survey doesn't paint a rosy picture of canada's literacy levels, it seems to confirm what experts believed: if people don't read and write on a regular basis, then they will begin to forget how
it's a grim reality that should serve as a wakeup call that more resources need to be focused on improving literacy, said mr pollock
""""the availability of literacy education for all canadians across the country, wherever they may be, is spotty at best,"""" he said

that's the first lie he'll have to tell many more as he slips into the shadows of the underground where illegals hide
no one knows how many there are
one report estimates , illegal immigrants make canada their home, but solid figures can't be established most gravitate towards large urban centres -- toronto, vancouver and montreal -- hoping to get lost in the crowd, out of view ofimmigration authorities
in edmonton, canada immigration has files on  suspected illegals -- some are underground, some have broken immigration laws in other ways
and those are just the ones they know about
living without a real identity, without papers, work permits or rights, people in the underground resort to forgery, fake names and bought or borrowed social insurance numbers to make a living or apply for social assistancejsome are so-called """"overstays"""" without exit visas, immigration can't confirm whether the thousands of tourists who come to alberta each year ever board a plane for home
a few are refugees like alberto when his visitor visa expired, he was simply too scared to take a chance on canada's bureaucratic system, fearful he could join the  per cent of claimants rejected by the immigration and refugee board so far thisyear
others are so-called economic migrants -- people looking for a better way of life, more money, improved health care coming to canada via the legal route could require a two-year wait in their home country
without close relatives in canada, many wouldn't qualify under a system that gives preference to those who speak english or french, display job skills canada wants, and have education and training
john didn't want to wait living with a relative and getting paid under the table was better than his middle-class life in trinidad

all illegals are on the wanted list it's an expensive business for immigration enforcement officers across the country who conduct , investigations each year
airlines flying into canadian airports are hit with $ million annually in fines, hotel fees and flights home that's the price the federal government demands when carriers fail to screen out travellers with bogus documents
if they aren't caught, illegals' time in the underground is often lonely and filled with fear

enforcement officers are the cops of immigration they don't carry guns; tools of the trade are handcuffs, maps, files and computers full of information on every foreigner who has applied to immigrate through the local office
there's no record of their latest suspect, john, so the two officers head to a shop where he is reported to be working and stake it out eventually, a lanky employee appears the enforcement officers rush inside the shop -- he's their man

john's eyes are big, scared he gulps, then swallows hard caught after three years in the underground, he's stunned; the words stall as they come out
""""basically yeah i work here for my (relatives) they pay me cash""""
jacobs puts the handcuffs on he's sympathetic, but tough he hears heart-breaking stories time and time again and some lies
""""people's lives literally come crashing down before your very eyes,"""" says galloway of her investigator's job """"yes, we have these objectives to protect the labor market  but you can't help but feel for them""""jsimilar to many illegals who are caught, john is here for economic reasons he only wants a chance at a better life, a chance to put some money away, maybe send a little to his family back home
that's all -year-old christina wants
until recently, the mother of four from trinidad worked hard in edmonton's underground as a janitor, paid her taxes and never collected social assistance
sobbing uncontrollably in immigration's detention cell, she clutches her heart, spilling out the story to two reporters the day after she's caught
""""i feel like i'm going to collapse,"""" she says """"i've never been in such trouble""""
her biggest crime was assuming a false name it was easy to take on another identity when a friend returned home to trinidad in  and, as a parting gift, handed christina her alberta health care card, social insurance number, and landed immigrantpapers
she winces now as she recalls why she came to edmonton in the first place -- to comfort her dying mother after the ailing woman died in late , christina saw no reason to return to her flagging business and needy, adult children on the poorcaribbean island
christina knew she couldn't get legal status in canada the point system for independents was too tough she could never qualify for a job on immigration's occupations list, which aims to bring in skilled workers and immigration would dock pointsfor her age, two for every year over 
for two years, babysitting was the only job she could get when her friend offered up her id, christina emerged from the shadows with a new persona, an apartment of her own and a proper job as a bee-clean janitor she emptied the money collecting inher purse into a newly-opened bank account and almost immediately, she began hoarding
""""i was buying stuff for when i go back home; you know clothing, tv, gold rings, chains i had every intention of going home, but the time wasn't right for me yet""""
christina dreamed of returning to trinidad, with $,, to open another business
after four years in edmonton, christina was still far from her financial goal: """"everything just came crashing down as i was about to make a step forward
""""i don't have the slightest idea (who reported me),"""" she says now """"i always keep things to myself, i don't go around talking i always keep a low profile""""
arrests like christina's are a matter of upholding the law and protecting canadian jobs but one edmonton settlement worker, stan nuttall, points out: """"most of the jobs refugees take, canadians wouldn't do anyway; working in restaurants washingdishes or cleaning buildings""""

alberto works hard, but saves little he says the boss often pays late and not the full amount promised
but he can't argue illegals have no rights
deep down, alberto knows it can't last canada immigration is out there, somewhere eventually someone will rat
immigration enforcement is every illegal's biggest dread and now immigration minister bernard valcourt is looking to grant officers more power to clamp down on the flow of illegals
proposals to refashion the immigration act have been tabled in the house of commons changes include everything from setting limits on some categories of immigrants to cracking down on smuggling operations
more legal muscle is needed to fingerprint and search people arriving in canada without proper documents, the government says now, officers have no authority to search refugee claimants even if a passport is sticking out of their coat pocketjit doesn't matter how people arrive here -- by car, boat or plane, with a false passport or smuggled in -- everyone is entitled to make a refugee claim
while advocates applaud such openness, others complain it makes canada a haven for criminals
sgt jim medley, head of the rcmp's immigration and passport unit, wishes it were easier to keep people with criminal backgrounds out of canada
he points to a file on his desk, one of many it's the case of a central american, claiming to be a political refugee on the run rcmp found out he's also a convicted cocaine trafficker
the man was picked up recently after he failed to show up at a refugee determination hearing; checks showed an american record for aggravated assault and armed robbery
""""there are many problems with this sort of file number one, this individual didn't come here and suddenly become a criminal  he was a criminal before he got here,"""" says medley
""""problem is, we can't go into central america and get records the authorities won't give it to you, and you can't trust the information anyway""""
that's why the federal government's new bill aims to take fingerprints of every person who arrives at canada's doorstep with hopes of gaining refugee status -- the government wants to confirm their identity and deter crime
immigration seeks to save canadians the hassle and expense of imported crime the department reports it """"removed"""" some  convicted criminals and known terrorists from canada in  -- out of the total , people sent packing
criminals are often deported, forever banned from canada unless they get special consent granted by the immigration minister himself and that's very rare
once deported, people who want back in must resort to sneaking
like chaun webb
early one morning in the city's downtown, immigration and rcmp members tracked down the -year-old american in his basement apartment he gave up without a fight
""""immigration's here yeah, i let them in i'm tired of running,"""" he tells his wife on the phone, cigarette dangling from his mouth
he is searched, spread-eagled against the wall behind him sits a child's rocking horse a framed photo of his smiling daughter adorns the top of the television set
webb has a record in the states and is """"criminally inadmissible"""" to canada he's already been deported once he sneaked back in  months ago to live with his canadian wife and their -month-old daughter
if webb had stayed out of trouble, who knows how long he could have lived here underground but then police caught him in possession of stolen property and his fingerprints ended up in the hands of immigration officers
""""i'll probably be deported again, split my family up,"""" he says later, speaking on a phone in a visitor's booth in the edmonton remand centre """"i don't need this type of hiding, playing hide and go seek with the police""""
he says he prefers canada to seattle, where he's from, because there's less crime
""""alberto! wake up!"""" carlos whispers urgently in spanish carlos, alberto's latest roommate, shakes him out of a sound sleep""""get up,"""" carlos says """"i have something important to tell you"""" rcmp and immigration officers are looking foralberto moments earlier, they had confronted carlos in the apartment hallway, asking about luis bernal
""""he's gone downtown,"""" carlos lied, slipping inside to warn alberto as soon as the officers left
but the police will be back they know where alberto lives, they know his false name, they know he works illegally
for years he'd thought about this moment, dreading it now it's arrived, but alberto still doesn't know what to do
""""on the one hand, i felt calm,"""" he says later """"on the other hand, i felt nervous about the thought of returning to argentina""""
he must decide what to do should he run? should he stay? he discusses the question with his friend while stuffing his only possessions into a hockey bag: a tape recorder, cassettes, books and clothingjtime ticks he can't eat then, a knock at the door rcmp he doesn't try to hide it's all over
some people -- legal or not -- migrate to canada because they know this country takes relatively good care of the downtrodden they hear health care benefits and welfare money are available
at edmonton's unemployment insurance office, manager frank sonier talks of people who make multiple claims, collecting unemployment benefits or welfare from several provinces at the same time
there are no hard numbers available on newcomers ripping off the system but sonier says the percentage of migrants guilty of such abuses is no greater than that of canadian citizens
immigration now has a warrant out for -year-old leonor lopez-valdivi -- after she lived underground and collected thousands of dollars in social assistance for more than two years
the cuban woman is a us work-permit holder who resided in miami, before entering canada with three children in tow
she had no relatives here, no real reason for coming to this country but lopez did take more than $, in welfare over an -month period
""""one of her primary reasons for coming to canada seemed to be to collect social assistance,"""" says one immigration investigator
it's been just two months since the arrest, but already alberto's life in the underground seems a thousand years ago everything has changed """"whoever (tipped off the rcmp) thought he was doing something bad to me but, in the end, he didsomething good,"""" alberto tells two reporters at the west-end apartment where he still lives with carlos
he has a work permit now, granted after he passed his first refugee hearing at immigration
he smiles sheepishly, showing crooked teeth, as he proudly hands reporters his id badge from the provincial museum still a janitor, but this time alberto's real name is on the badge now he gets weekends off, and a genuine pay cheque
the day of his final hearing before the immigration and refugee board, alberto slicks back his black hair, puts on a pressed navy suit and polished shoes he wants to make a good impression
he knows it will be months before they decide his case, but he's praying the two adjudicators assigned to hear his refugee claim will believe the story
thoughts of returning to argentina frighten him who will care if the military returns to get him, if he disappears?
""""i am just a little guy, a grain of sand,"""" he says
alberto walks into the hearing room, the door closes behind
his life is in their hands

The vast ambition of the president and sole shareholder of sock manufacturer Iris Hosiery Inc. was on display during a recent tour of his 250,000-square-foot plant in Riviere-des-Prairies, as he told how his next projects will be south of the border. ``I'll build a plant like this in Mexico, then one in Alabama,'' Badia said, gesturing to a row of new knitting machines just shipped in from Italy. It will employ 4,000 people by the time the second phase is finished in 1999, Badia insists. And production will jump from the current 165,000 dozen pairs a week to 250,000 dozen pairs by the end of next year.","montreal - andrew badia doesn't think small, never did the vast ambition of the president and sole shareholder of sock manufacturer iris hosiery inc was on display during a recent tour of his ,-square-foot plant in riviere-des-prairies, as he told how his next projects will be south of the border
``i'll build a plant like this in mexico, then one in alabama,'' badia said, gesturing to a row of new knitting machines just shipped in from italy
``globally, we'll control all socks''
the -year-old human dynamo raced through his ever-expanding plant, yelling out first- name greetings to dozens of his , employees over the racket of giant knitting machines going full bore and barking out instructions to his sister-in-law, one of many relatives on staff
sales for the year ended oct  topped $ million for the sock maker, a -fold jump from , when iris consisted of a small shop with  line workers
the next step in his conquest of the planet will be in may, when iris will break ground for its latest expansion, the first phase of a one million square foot plant, a size normally associated with car factories
it will employ , people by the time the second phase is finished in , badia insists and production will jump from the current , dozen pairs a week to , dozen pairs by the end of next year
iris may well need all that space, having just signed a contract to be nike's canadian sock supplier, among other contracts
badia radiates compulsive energy, and the running shoes he wears with a black suit and white silk shirt attest to his get- up-and-go
competitors acknowledge his significance as a player, but it's iris's phenomenal growth curve that has them scratching their heads
``it's an enigma,'' said one former supplier
``i just don't see how anyone can grow that fast''
badia's explanation is simple
``what we're doing is taking more and more business away from imports,'' he said, ``in an industry that people in canada basically think is dead''
in fact, said janice schroeder of ottawa's canadian apparel federation, canadian clothing exports more than tripled between  and 
in , she said, canada exported $ million worth of clothes, $ million of that to the united states
by , that figure had surged to $ billion, of which $ billion went to the united states
the low canadian dollar and the elimination of tariffs have helped, but schroeder also credited manufacturers who stayed ahead of the curve by re-investing a slice of profits in new equipment and technology
free trade helped by lowering or eliminating tariffs among the three countries apparel manufacturers can now ship garments duty free, as long as the yarn comes from one of the countries and is knitted or weaved in one of the three
and manufacturers in canada helped their own cause by focusing largely on the ``mid-atlantic'' products - good quality but not top-end like italian or french clothes - and on service
better than in america, where service is a way of life?
``well, yes,'' said schroeder, ``american service on the retail side is very good but their apparel manufacturers are so huge that if you place what they consider to be a small order, they don't treat you very well''
iris hosiery is not about to overtake industry leader sara lee, a $-billion (us)-a-year business which markets internationally known brand names like hanes, l'eggs, playtex, sheer energy and underalls, or fruit of the loom, a $-billion-a-year company
but aside from socks, sara lee and fruit of the loom both have divisions that produce things other than socks, including food, underwear, jeans and children's apparel badia's shop may as well be called socks r us, since it focuses on one product
``we're the largest manufacturer of socks in canada by a factor of two''
randy harris of retail consultant kormos harris & associates in toledo, ohio, and an expert on the canadian and mexican markets, said that iris is well positioned to increase its sales in the united states
about  million pairs of socks are sold in canada annually, worth about $ million at the retail level, and at least  times those amounts in the united states
``you may have lower labor costs in bangladesh, but you can't get just-in-time delivery from bangladesh, that makes no sense,'' said harris
``so americans now accept the fact that sourcing in canada is just like sourcing in california, and that's a great help to dependable companies like iris''
``but they are very quiet in the industry i don't think i've ever even seen their name in the trade papers''
iris sells to all the major department stores, including the bay, sears and eatons, as well as the discount chains like kmart, zellers, wal-mart and price costco the company also serves the low-end, including the rossy, croteau and giant tiger chains
iris is now zeroing in on higher-end manufacturers like toronto-based mcgregor socks, badia said, pointing to a silky- looking pair hanging in the design department
mcgregor socks president earl lipson said he found it ``a high compliment that he considers us his competition but he has a whole host of far more powerful competitors south of the border''
he said badia's background as a penniless, uneducated immigrant from italy first to australia and then to canada, and his rise from a machine operator to a big-time sock operator ``is a fascinating and unique story''
``it's interesting to me that our industry is generally regarded as a coal mine,'' said lipson, ``but he sees it more as a gold mine, not a coal mine''
fibres importer and supplier jeff frank of montreal-based domestic converters, who's known badia since the early s, said that ``someone in my family used to deliver a box of yarn to him cod - no credit, he didn't have any money''
``one thing is for sure, he's got the pedal to the metal, and he ain't gonna slow down his growth,'' said frank
one source who did not want to be named marveled at ``the deep pockets, the incredible financing of this company,'' and added that the sheer amount of machinery iris imports from italy - several dozen knitting machines this month, each one costing $, - ``simply boggles the mind''
``they buy equipment at a rate and a pace far ahead of even the most profitable of mills,'' said the source
badia wouldn't give figures, but said that he stays ahead by re-investing much of the cash the company generates in new machinery
``we make a good living, nothing spectacular, but comfortable,'' he said

the sculptures, titled postcards from the piazzas, spring from the city of ottawa's public art program that commissions area artists to create works of art in public spaces
wakefield artist cj fleury has fashioned images of sports, food, religion and manual labour in the sculptures that were shaped in her studio
the result is sort of la dolce vita on a busy boulevard in the heart of little italy that's still home to italian residents, restaurants, cafes, grocery stores and businesses and of course, the nearby st anthony's church
each sculpture is composed of a stylized bronze object on top of a granite-art column that measure about two metres in height
the sculptures are giving a historical context to an area of the city now being revitalized
""""every one of these sculptures are inspired by a piazza, or the architecture or an event that is taking place in the piazza,"""" said fleury who researched the history of the preston street-area by collecting stories from early residents, and looking at newspapers and photos from that era
""""the piazzas are like meeting places,"""" she said, adding they are where italians often congregate to socialize, shop or be entertained
the  sculptures are scattered along preston street, from pamilla street to primrose street they will be officially unveiled monday prior to la vendemmia, an annual fall event on preston street that will showcase the best of italian wine and food products
fleury will lead free walking tours of preston street beginning at  am sept  and  during la vendemmia celebrations
she said the sculptures are visual snapshots of italian life, emphasizing the links between the residents and the community and each one has an unique take on aspects of life about the residents who settled there from italy
on the sidewalk in front of preston hardware, a sculpture depicts the strong work ethic of italian immigrants to canada the column has engraved construction tools, scissors and woodworking tools, while the top has a stylized bronze hat and bronze envelopes, portraying letters an immigrant worker would have mailed to his family in italy
""""the column has writing on it in three different languages (english, french and italian) and it says, 'dear maria, i found work i will send for you soon love, berardino carrozzi,'"""" said fleury, adding the quote is from a real ottawa couple
""""the writing (on the column) acts like a postcard of someone being away on a trip, or someone else who might tuck the postcard in a dresser mirror or keep it as a bookmark,"""" she said
in front of the st anthony soccer club, a granite column sits with black and white imagery of a soccer ball and is topped with a roman wreath -- often depicted in trophies
""""it's about soccer and inspired by the history of soccer in italy and the history of soccer at st anthony soccer club,"""" said fleury
the top of the column has a wreath in honour of dante, the italian poet, and steno rossanese, co-founder of the soccer club who died in 
the artworks certainly got the attention of alan and maureen amey
""""they are beautiful a lot of thought went into them, especially the designs to make them appropriate for this area,"""" said maureen amey, who lives off preston street
""""they give you a taste of italy,"""" she added
now that the project is finished fleury is happy with the results
""""it was a privilege to work with a culture that has so much beauty in it because a lot of what we do as (contemporary) art is not necessary predicated on producing a beautiful object
""""to me, the bottom line in the pieces i made was to make them as beautiful as possible,"""" said fleury

Johanne Poirier, a constitutional law expert from Quebec who is a professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, said it is hard to imagine the Belgian model being used in Canada.","  tomorrow: the belgian 'blok'
brussels - despite stephen harper's admiration for its flexible federalism, belgium is more prone to splitting into smaller countries than ever before, says the country's deputy prime minister
in a freewheeling interview, johan vande lanotte said one country's system could not be used as a model by another even if it does have some of the same problems, such as the language tensions shared by canada and belgium
instead, the flemish socialist says both countries can learn from the other's """"successes and mistakes""""
the timing of mr harper's public infatuation seems even more unfortunate considering the heightened talk of separation growing in the northern half of flanders, home to most of the country's dutch- speakers
a cover story in one of the country's major french magazines, le vif, was headlined """"if the flemish were to throw us out,"""" and examining """"difficult scenarios for an expected separation""""
in a major speech given last week in quebec city, mr harper said he wants his party to consider how the belgium model of linguistic community governments can be adapted to canada his surprise suggestion has since been derided by the liberal cabinet and other critics
mr vande lanotte wasn't shy with advice of his own for canada however he took a swipe at our """"frozen"""" constitutional talks and the failure to recognize quebec's """"distinctiveness"""" in its constitution
""""you can't change by law the reality of the situation canada's constitution says there are  provinces, including quebec, but finally, everyone knows quebec is special,"""" said mr van lanotte
but, he says, a country's legal system must adapt to changing times
he says belgium's constantly evolving constitution """"has nothing structurally that leads us to co-exist"""" but instead of splitting, the country's leaders so far choose to continue """"their long talk""""
referring to the geographical disparity between the two countries, mr vande lanotte joked that his country's willingness to """"think outside the box"""" when it came to constitutional talks was because """"the box is so small""""
mr vande lanotte is familiar with canada's federal system, having spent three months in sherbrooke, que, in - while writing his doctoral thesis on constitutional law and the issue of decentralization
he said his fondness for canada flows from the memories of his father who, as a boy, lived in cranbrook, bc, from  and  the deputy prime minister said he later visited with his parents when they discovered distant relatives still living there
philippe engels, a journalist at le vif who has studied canadian federalism, said mr harper's choice of belgian federalism is surprising considering his opinion that it is """"out of control""""
he says that since the country adopted a federalist system in , there have been five major reforms to the complex structure
""""none of these reforms have had time to work we have this expression in belgium that 'the ink is not even dry on a new agreement and we're on the route to new reforms',"""" said mr engels
belgian federalism involves two different types of constituent units -- the communities and the regions the flemish, french and germans make up the three communities and flanders, wallonia and brussels make up the regions
the communities, created in , have power over language, culture, education and social services such as health care meanwhile, the federal government retains power over financial and monetary policy, justice, social security (employment insurance and pensions), health care insurance, some crown corporations, national defence and the direction of international relations
however, the regions and communities can conclude international treaties

one day, a young black man walked in, looking for work we weren't taking applications, but i chatted with him and we had a pleasant conversation he left smiling mr lipman called me in his office to congratulate me on how i had handled the situation i'll never forget his words: """"it's important to be kind, especially when you get a black, asian or immigrant applicant everything is so much tougher for them""""
the job-seeker was not an immigrant, but immigrants are indeed among those who have it tough
immigrating is one of the most difficult things one can do: leaving loved ones behind, settling in a place where people don't give a flying tutu about you, working hard for little money and gradually facing the fact that it will be a while before the locals count you as one of """"us""""
when people complain about immigrants not integrating, not speaking perfect french after six months, not getting a covid vaccine, i say, given them a break if the immigrants don't integrate fully, their children and grandchildren most likely will
in , i interviewed emanuel gracioppo, the patriarch of the family that owns standa, on fleury street east in montreal he arrived in canada in , worked on building sites and eventually opened a small store offering immigrants like him imported goods at low prices there are countless contraptions to make tomato sauce, italian bedding and of course, the classic """"bonbonnière"""" at the heart of every italian wedding like many immigrants, gracioppo wanted his own business this store is a showcase for a successful immigrant experience: today, standa occupies , square metres and emanuele and giovanna's children, all born in canada, run the business
too often, immigrants are treated like silly putty, a toy you can bend and shape to suit your needs, not theirs immigrants are real people, with real people's hopes and dreams not fuel to stoke the debate on language, laïcité or whatever the political battle of the day is
immigrants always have been pawns in political games that have nothing to do with them they are just trying to build a new life let's give them some recognition, not aggravation
i know long ago, i walked in their shoes i'll never forget what it was like lravary@yahoocom",The Kingston Whig-Standard,2021-07-07,2021,7,7

toronto -- a piano tinkles out a rueful melody in the distance a small boy emerges from the shadows and discovers one of those old-fashioned stereoscopes that captivated families with the wonders of three-dimensional images at the turn of the century
as the boy gazes through the twin apertures, a background tableau of people once frozen in time by the photographer's lens is liberated into movement they begin singing a sweet, insinuating melody about ``distant music simple and somehow sublime'' -- a melody that later becomes more insistent as it heralds ``an era exploding, a century spinning''
and so we have ragtime confidently asserting its credentials from the moment the house lights dim in metro toronto's ford centre for the performing arts it is a stunning opening to a magnificent new musical
as the seductive rhythms of composer stephen flaherty's opening ragtime music intensify, so does the sense of a surging human tapestry the genteel white new rochelle family we see at the beginning soon finds itself sharing this living picture frame with the bustle of blacks from harlem and later with a cultural transfusion of poor jewish immigrants from europe the groundwork is being laid: this remarkable musical version of el doctorow's  novel is both a celebration and a lamentation; its subject both the triumph and the tragedy of the american dream
the broadway-bound production, which had its world premiere sunday, honors the sensibility of the original with as impressive a fusion of creative brilliance as we have seen on the great white way in decades
massive bouquets are in order for a lot of people -- playwright terence mcnally, who brought off an obviously tricky stage adaptation with skill and sympathy; composer stephen flaherty and lyricist lynn ahrens, who have contributed songs of marvellous vitality and variety, both melodically and lyrically; director frank galati, whose gifts as a visual stylist are complemented by a social and political sensitivity that brings us to the heartbeat of this musical; and finally, toronto impresario garth drabinsky, whose vision made the whole thing possible
above all, there is the splendid ensemble cast that has seized on this wealth of opportunity to put the final seal on a show of unusual emotional and musical richness
the focus is on three families -- one white and privileged; one proud and black; one poor, jewish and immigrant -- and how their lives eventually interconnect
a problem prevalent with many musicals, particularly those adapted from books, is their failure to give flesh and blood and sinew to their characters
but ragtime's inhabitants are never just cardboard cutouts mcnally may be restricted to giving us at best a short-hand sketch of the novel, but he has been scrupulous in finding essential kernels of truth in every person
but flaherty and ahrens also merit warm congratulations for creating songs that genuinely define the characters the success of this approach is reflected most stunningly in the numbers created for coalhouse walker, the black musician transformed into an enraged revolutionary when he is victimized by prejudice
early on, brian stokes williams (who delivers a charismatic performance as coalhouse) joins ensemble members for an ingratiating shuffle number called gettin' ready rag; the song reflects his optimism over the future and his determination to abandon his feckless ways and win back the woman he loves
later, coalhouse and his lady sarah (the mellow-voiced audra mcdonald) sing wheels of a dream, a great love ballad and also an affirmation of belief in a good and just america but later, like an icicle through the heart, comes the emotionally destroyed coalhouse's soliloquy in which he sings of blood and pain each song advances the plot; each song deepens the resonance; each further delineates the character
williams doesn't deliver the only powerhouse performance marin mazzie is superb both musically and dramatically in the pivotal role of the upper-class mother who comes to embody the compassion and generosity of spirit that are at the core of the ragtime story
canada's steven sutcliffe brings sympathy and intensity to the role of her younger brother, caught between a world of tradition and conformity and a frightening new one of change and revolution
will we see a better new musical before the millennium? it seems highly doubtful

his latest book, un apres-midi de septembre (boreal, $) is no exception essentially an autobiographical fragment, this family chronicle could just as easily be a novel as archambault penetrates to the heart of one of the great maturing moments in a man's life, the death of his mother
the man, gilles, spends the last few months of his mother's life visiting her every day in the hospital each detail of the slow inexorable progress of the disease that will finally take her is noted
each event, each day brings back memories of his unloved, even hated father, long gone, and of time spent with him and his mother
his life gets new focus when he learns he was conceived before his parents were married and was almost aborted his very existence hung on the whim of the moment and the difficulties in that era in deciding for or against abortion
archambault explores the meaning of this evanescent moment and the fragility of life when his mother dies, he must confront again his own mortality
was he really loved or only endured? in fact what is the importance and the meaning of the moment of conception? so many accidents go to make up the individual that we are
here is a book to savor, not only for the importance of the theme and the exploration of the relationships with one's mother (and father), but also for the pleasure of the style, of the use of language

he attempts to make a comparison between canada and the middle east he states that, """"canada, like the middle east"""" is """"a place only good to make a living""""
both canada and the middle east are good places to make a living, but the comparison ends there countries of the middle east are not immigrant-accepting nations they take people from many nations and allow them to work for varying periods of time on employment visas with only very rare exceptions, foreign workers in the middle east are never granted citizenship and as such will always occupy the lower echelons of society
canada, on the other hand, grants full citizenship after three years of obtaining permanent residency citizens or permanent residents are free to take up any employment they wish and work where they wish rodrigues says that when whites migrate from the cities, their former neighbourhoods turn into """"ethnic ghettos""""
as one who claims to have researched the canadian society, he should have noted that immigrants tend to start their life in canada living in close proximity to those from their home countries there are neighbourhoods in toronto that are, or have been, """"ethnic"""" the jewish community got its start in the spadina rd, kensington market area the chinese have established communities on dundas west, broadview and, more recently, in scarborough the italians, and later the portuguese, established communities in west toronto
those communities are hardly ghettos they are thriving, busy communities the first generation of the respective communities settled in these areas of the city, but their children rarely stay second-generation canadians, canadian-born and often graduates of higher education, move on to live wherever they wish

second, blame me, not the chretien government no one in the government asked for that particular analysis my primary research interest is prejudice, so i chose to look at the data silly me, i thought citizenship and immigration should be told where in canada immigrants are facing the highest levels of discrimination

North York committee on race and ethnic relations was recently told that in Metropolitan Toronto, Jews are facing a """"phenomenal resurgence"""" of anti-Semitic attacks.","the debate about multiculturalism is growing in intensity as most ethnic minorities soon discover, the inside story on ethnicity in canada is that speaking one native language or adhering to the culture of """"the old country"""" will be of little tangible value in the marketplace, in the schools, or in the canadian political and financial establishments those ethnic minorities who succeed in this country do so not because of their foreign culture but despite it success comes from opportunities seized, degrees granted or just plain luck success also comes because many ethnics soon learn the real rules of the game
ethnic minorities, especially the second generation, know that by holding an octoberfest or speaking greek or eating perogies, one status or opportunities are thereby not significantly enhanced it may be quaint to bring ethnicity out of the closet, but this cultural excursion rarely leads to prosperity except for those who are in the restaurant business
most immigrants soon realize that in order to succeed, it is usually best to be assimilated their children are dispatched through the schools and quickly fit into the host culture the parents retain the italian or german accent thereby reinforcing their immigrant status children quickly speak english or french and thus escape the schoolyard stigma and the pejorative connotations associated with accented speech
those visible minorities who are not easily absorbed continue to encounter the indifference of governments, prejudice in the job and housing markets and the outright racism of the population at large
immigrants, whether the irish of the s or the chinese of the s, have not always been cordially received at times the host society has been extremely resentful today resentment against those who are different in our midst remains and often boils over into racist hatred

2774302284,Canada embraces its diversity,Aucun(e) disponible.,"there has been much public discussion in recent polls and
the media about """"canadian values and way of life"""" and the question
of """"reasonable accommodation"""" of immigrants' beliefs and practices
it seems that most canadians welcome diverse immigrants coming to
canada, but are unhappy that the new immigrants are not adapting to
""""canadian values"""" and are pushing the limits of accommodation
the questions then are: do we have agreement on a set of canadian
values? are these broad enough to accommodate all of us? is there
only one """"way of life""""? have these values changed over time and
what are they based on? have these values remained static or is
there room for change?
along with these questions is the thorny one of what is the
""""reasonable accommodation"""" canadians are willing to make to help
newer immigrants feel respected, gain a sense of belonging and
loyalty to their new country?
from an informal survey and some research, i have compiled a list
of """"canadian values"""" i think these are pretty wonderful
citizenship and immigration canada states we are a democracy and
our values are equality, respect for cultural differences, freedom,
peace and law and order
in my survey, people said that many of the values are based on
western philosophy, the ideals of enlightenment, true liberalism
and the development of democracy these are the primacy of the
individual, the institutions of a democratic state, equality of all,
equal justice and protection under the law
the  charter of rights and freedoms and international treaties,
such as the universal human rights agreement, articulate our
values
we are rightly proud of our policy of multiculturalism and, though
at times it seems that the ideal is under attack, most canadians
value the diversity and plurality of our nation
the charter has enhanced our rights and freedoms as it has allowed
for rights that were not considered possible  years ago, eg,
same-sex marriage, multiculturalism and the enshrinement of equal
rights for women
canadians see themselves as law-abiding and courteous, with a
sense of fairness and a strong social consciousness as a newer
immigrant pointed out, canada is seen as an active global power
whose actions are imbued with social justice and compassion for
others
the major gap for me is that we have not incorporated two key
values of the aboriginal people one is the place of the family; it
is very strong among aboriginal people and isn't limited to the
nuclear or the extended family, but instead to the community as a
whole
the other value is the respect for the environment and how
aboriginal people see nature and the world around them as intrinsic
parts of their lives it is interesting that a lot of newer
immigrants would agree about the prime focus on the family, the
interdependency of its members, and recently we have all become
more conscious of the impact of our actions on the environment
as we believe in the equality of all, civility among us, a sense
of fairness and a """"live-and-let-live"""" philosophy, then where are
the lines to be drawn about what becomes acceptable when we are
faced with differences? these values are obviously a two-way street,
allowing all canadians, newer immigrants and established ones, to
live as they wish, but there is a point of discomfort about the
limits of """"live and let live""""
a recent poll found that the majority of canadians accept
multiculturalism, but that this support evaporates when immigrants'
religious and cultural practices threaten gender equality this
raises another thorny question: what are the limits of reasonable
accommodation?
this is not a new question because canada's history is one of
waves of different immigrants with each influx of newcomers come
periods of uncertainty and discomfort about the changes that do
occur for example, the russian doukhobors and the ukrainians were
viewed with suspicion; the irish were seen as too different from
the english and the scots; the italians had a bad time in toronto
when they first came; and the japanese and chinese were looked upon
with even greater suspicion
but what happened is that, with each new wave, changes occurred in
the canadian way of life, as we absorbed new ideas and practices
and now take pride in what identifies us as canadians
no offence is meant, but one of the major changes i have noted
over the years, with the introduction of the charter, is that there
has been a move to more universal values of human rights rather
than values based on any one religion's teachings this means that
for those of us whose heritage is not judeo-christian, there is
greater room for inclusiveness
i know there is tension as many would like a return to what they
see as judeo-christian values, for they perceive an erosion of
their practices, while other groups want greater freedom to express
their religious rights
there is a feeling amongst many """"older"""" canadians that newer
immigrants do not acknowledge the legacy of the west, and are
critical of much of these traditions
on the other hand, non-western canadians state that their values
should also be part of the evolution of canadian values
although other countries such as britain and netherlands are
having similar discussions, i do hope that in canada we will
continue our tradition of inclusivity and acceptance rather than
narrowing down our identity of what it is to be canadian
our strength is our ability to compromise and, with give and take,
we must come to some resolution we must have shared common values,
no matter from where we originate the alternative is increased
feelings of threat, discrimination and racism we don't want that,
do we?

2774211853,Millhaven security detainees have lost legal protections,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the following is excerpted from the - annual report
of howard sapers, correctional investigator canada, issued monday
the coming year will be challenging as several factors may
influence the ability of the correctional service to respond to its
pressing issues new criminal justice policy may be implemented,
with the net effect of increasing prison populations from our
experience and the available research, the correctional service
will be unable to meet its legislative mandate if such an increase
is not paired with significant investments in reintegration
initiatives, programming and health care services
two additional broad policy issues are of concern to this office:
canada's endorsement of the optional protocol to the convention
against torture and the situation of national security detainees
first, the protocol was adopted by the united nations general
assembly in december  canada was a member of the group that
drafted it and voted in favour of its adoption the protocol
establishes a system of regular visits undertaken by independent
international and national bodies to places where people are
deprived of their liberty, in order to prevent torture and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
in my last annual report -, i encouraged the canadian
government to yet again demonstrate its leadership by signing and
ratifying this important human rights instrument moving quickly on
signature and ratification would add to canada's long historical
tradition of promoting and defending human rights at home and
abroad
the second policy issue that concerns my office is the situation
of individuals detained pursuant to national security certificates
a national security certificate is a removal order issued by the
government of canada against permanent residents and foreign
nationals who are inadmissible to canada on grounds of national
security a recent decision has been made by the federal government
to transfer security certificate detainees held under the
immigration and refugee protection act from ontario facilities to a
federal facility, pending their removal from canada
in ontario facilities, the detainees could legally file complaints
regarding conditions of confinement with the office of the ontario
ombudsman that office had the jurisdiction to investigate
complaints filed by the detainees pursuant to the ontario ombudsman
act
the immigration holding centre has been built in kingston within
the perimeter fence of millhaven penitentiary the canadian border
service agency entered into a service contract with the
correctional service to provide the border service agency with the
physical detention facility and with security staff the border
service agency has a contract in place with the red cross to
monitor the care and treatment of detainees in immigration holding
centres, including the new kingston holding centre the red cross,
a non-government organization, has no enabling legislation to carry
out a role as an oversight agency
the transfer of detainees from ontario facilities to the kingston
holding centre means that the detainees will lose the benefit of a
rigorous ombudsman's legislative framework to file complaints about
their care and humane treatment while in custody the office of the
correctional investigator is concerned that the detainees will no
longer have the benefits and legal protections afforded by
ombudsman legislation pursuant to the optional protocol to the
convention against torture, a non-profit organization with no
legislative framework, such as the red cross, is unlikely to meet
the protocol's requirement for domestic oversight
on a final note, i would like to report on my commitment in last
year's annual report to enhance this office's citizen engagement
and information activities, and to comment on emerging areas of
focus
this past year, my office has been involved in a record number of
outreach activities we have formally consulted with a number of
non-governmental organizations, mental health organizations and
experts, community groups, and organizations representing
aboriginal people and visible minorities i have also increased my
involvement with the media and my participation in public events to
enhance the understanding of my role and responsibilities as
canada's federal prison ombudsman
as for next year's focus, i am increasingly concerned about the
high number of deaths and self-inflicted injuries in custody over
the last decade my office is especially concerned with the growing
number of similar recommendations made year after year by the
correctional service's national investigations, provincial coroners
and medical examiners, and the ability of the correctional service
to consistently implement these recommendations across the country
a timely and systematic follow-up on corrective actions is required
to ensure that preventive measures are taken and result in a lower
incidence of self-inflicted injuries and deaths over the course of
the next year, my office will conduct a comprehensive review of
reports and recommendations dealing with deaths and major injuries
in custody, particularly suicides and self-inflicted injuries
there is much to be done to make corrections in canada more fair,
humane and effective but we are building from a solid foundation

348804095,A bilingual Sudbury is only a fantasy:   [Final Edition ],"I would like to thank K. Pasanen for inadvertently pointing out the merits of Mike Whitehouse's article on bilingualism (Sudbury Should Remain English First -- Aug. 18 and Cities Divided -- Aug. 10). Had it not been for Passanen's comments, injudicious as they were, I would have missed this insightful analysis on Sudbury's potential as a bilingual community. Whereas I enjoyed Whitehouse's article, it was, alas, too idealistic. There are many hurdles to the City of Greater Sudbury task in becoming bilingual. While Sudburians are every bit as deserving of bilingual services as Monctonians, the latter benefit from a provincial government that is both officially bilingual and a member of la Francophonie. These factors allow the French language to be held in higher esteem in New Brunswick society.","to the editor:
i would like to thank k pasanen for inadvertently pointing out the merits of mike whitehouse's article on bilingualism (sudbury should remain english first -- aug  and cities divided -- aug ) had it not been for passanen's comments, injudicious as they were, i would have missed this insightful analysis on sudbury's potential as a bilingual community
as a local francophone, i found it refreshing to see an anglophone recognizing the value of bilingualism for our community whitehouse's article was all the more striking given that it appeared in a newspaper that does not even bother to spell french- canadian names properly, that is, with accents and hyphens where necessary
whereas i enjoyed whitehouse's article, it was, alas, too idealistic there are many hurdles to the city of greater sudbury task in becoming bilingual
the first is that, while there is a substantial number of francophones in the area to warrant bilingualism, the french language is not held in high enough regard by the community in general
again, i feel that the sudbury star's laissez-faire attitude and tacit anglicization of our names both reflect and encourage a lack of respect for the french language and francophones
furthermore, while most area francophones are bilingual, many of them live a subtractive bilingualism, where competence in their mother tongue is not as well developed as it is in their second language this, too, contributes to a low status for the french language
additionally, there are political obstacles to overcome when the town of kapuskasing declared itself bilingual, the courts later declared that this was ultra vires
not surprisingly, when mike harris was asked to declare our national capital of ottawa bilingual, the premier replied, somewhat disingenuously, that such a decision was up to the people of ottawa, when in fact only the province has the power to make such a decision
moreover, it seems patently obvious that even if there were a demand for official bilingualism locally, the current conservative government has demonstrated no goodwill towards its francophone population except perhaps for the token recognition of our flag
while sudburians are every bit as deserving of bilingual services as monctonians, the latter benefit from a provincial government that is both officially bilingual and a member of la francophonie these factors allow the french language to be held in higher esteem in new brunswick society
in sharp contrast, ontario minister of francophone affairs john baird nonchalantly dismissed the montfort crisis as a health care issue and said that franco-ontarians were not interested in joining la francophonie
elsewhere, while it is good that pasanen admires our southern neighbours, it is saddening to see the writer eschews some of the basic tenets that we, as canadians, have formulated over the course of our history
canadians respect diversity we have tried to forge a tolerant society that encourages multiculturalism and bilingualism we realise that no one language is superior to another and we do not believe in forcing people to learn a language against their will
i realise that post-war canada may not have been overly kind to minorities whose countries of origin had sided with the axis powers
consequently, it is not surprising that some members of these groups, such as the local finnish population, may have felt a greater push or desire to assimilate into the dominant english- speaking society nevertheless, pasanen should not equate the post- war finnish-canadian experience with present-day mores
lastly, i would like to inform pasanen that the demand for french- language services in ontario does not come from quebec; many quebecois are ignorant of the existence of our french-speaking community and remain impervious to our plight
this legitimate demand comes from franco-ontarians as well as from conscientious anglophones who recognise the value and legitimacy of both our official languages
also, french in canada should not be misconstrued as an """"ethnic"""" language similarly, while pasanen may be artful in associating the """"brain-drain"""" with bilingualism, this problem is in fact a socio- economic issue, not a linguistic one

437794161,'A victory for all': Chretien:   [1 Edition ],"4. The legal framework in which democratic decisions are to be taken includes the rights and obligations of Canadians who live outside the province of Quebec as well as those who live within Quebec. In particular, the rights of other provinces and specifically the rights of minorities. 6. This means that the days of the 'astuces' (tricks) of Mr. Parizeau and the 'winning questions' of Mr. [Lucien Bouchard] are over. For a referendum to have any legitimacy, the question must be clear. And by clear, the Supreme Court does not refer to a question on some vague notion of partnership like the 'winning' question of 1995. The court refers specifically to the need for a question that provides, and I quote: 'the clear expression of a clear majority of Quebecers that they no longer wish to remain in Canada.' 8. The court also tells us that democracy requires a good-faith negotiation where a clear majority of Quebecers clearly express that they no longer want to be part of Canada. Not being part of Canada is not a sovereignty-partnership. It is not a sovereignty- association. It is secession. I quote, again, from the court: 'A clear majority on a clear question in favour of secession.' That is the position which was advocated by the lawyers for the federal government before the Supreme Court of Canada.","the following is the text of prime minister jean chretien's remarks yesterday concerning thursday's supreme court ruling on quebec independence:
the ruling yesterday by the supreme court of canada is of extraordinary importance it is not a victory for governments or politicians it is a victory for all canadians it protects the legal and democratic rights of citizens of our country for the future
it establishes the legal framework in which democratic decisions are to be taken it sets out clearly the principles under which canada has grown and flourished: federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect for minorities
there has been a lot of comment in the last  hours about (the) supreme court decision let me summarize briefly the most important elements of the decision:
 the unilateral declaration of independence which the current quebec government had in its back pocket before the last referendum is contrary to canadian law and to the fundamental principles of democracy
 such a unilateral declaration of independence is not supported by international law so much then for one of the principal myths the advocates of separation have tried to create over the years
 secession is as much a legal act as a political act
 the legal framework in which democratic decisions are to be taken includes the rights and obligations of canadians who live outside the province of quebec as well as those who live within quebec in particular, the rights of other provinces and specifically the rights of minorities
 this is very important and i quote: 'the referendum result, if it is to be taken as an expression of the democratic will, must be free of ambiguity, both in terms of the question asked and in terms of the support it generates'
 this means that the days of the 'astuces' (tricks) of mr parizeau and the 'winning questions' of mr bouchard are over for a referendum to have any legitimacy, the question must be clear and by clear, the supreme court does not refer to a question on some vague notion of partnership like the 'winning' question of  the court refers specifically to the need for a question that provides, and i quote: 'the clear expression of a clear majority of quebecers that they no longer wish to remain in canada'
 the supreme court of canada speaks of the need for an 'enhanced majority' in order to alter the fundamental balances of political power in other words, the secession of a province is so fundamental that it requires more than a simple majority for the results of a referendum question on secession to have any legitimacy according to the court, there must be no ambiguity in the result
 the court also tells us that democracy requires a good-faith negotiation where a clear majority of quebecers clearly express that they no longer want to be part of canada not being part of canada is not a sovereignty-partnership it is not a sovereignty- association it is secession i quote, again, from the court: 'a clear majority on a clear question in favour of secession' that is the position which was advocated by the lawyers for the federal government before the supreme court of canada
 in such a case, the court indicates the complexity and difficulty of the negotiations and suggests that everything would be on the table this includes the division of the national debt, boundaries, the protection of linguistic and cultural minorities, the rights of aboriginal people amongst others
 accordingly, the court says that: 'nobody seriously suggests that our national existence, seamless in so many aspects, could be effortlessly separated along the now provincial boundaries of quebec'
what the court has done is to confirm just how difficult it would be to break up one of the most successful countries in the world
we now know the legal and democratic framework we know that canada is not a prison, as lucien bouchard once suggested but we also know that quebecers will never lose their canadian citizenship, and all that goes with it, as a result of confusion and ambiguity
we believed that it was our obligation and our duty to the people of canada to seek the answer from the supreme court of canada at this time, not in the heat of a referendum campaign
but our objective is not to spend our time talking about how this country could break up
our objective is to continue to build a strong, united country, respectful of the rights and obligations, the hopes and dreams of all its citizens
a country that is economically prosperous and socially just
a country that respects minorities
a country of two official languages
a country with a thriving french culture, centred in quebec
a country which welcomes citizens from all over the world
twice in less than a generation, despite ambiguous questions, the people of quebec have chosen to be part of all of canada and (other) canadians    have expressed    their desire for the quebec society    to remain an essential part of canada
as we go forward, our task is to ensure that there be no more referendums on dismantling canada rather, we must devote all our energies to building canada in a way that quebecers can focus on the wonderful opportunities of being full participants in canada",Toronto Star,1998-08-22,1998,8,22

manitoba premier gary filmon, balanced perilously over a shaky coalition with his two opposition parties, finally fell through the divide on thursday and landed in a stalemate with quebec
filmon has been looking over his shoulder throughout the meech lake conference at manitoba liberal leader sharon carstairs and new democrat gary doer of the two, carstairs -- who has close political links with federal liberal jean chretien -- has been the most strident critic of the accord
the latest impasse came after manitoba had become frustrated in its search for charter protection and a """"canada clause"""" in the constitution
the """"canada clause"""" -- reaffirming the position in canadian society of various identifiable groups -- was a political priority for filmon the charter guarantees are a first item for carstairs, and for chretien
filmon, who leads a minority government and is most hampered by tight legislative rules at home, held a series of meetings with carstairs, doer, newfoundland premier clyde wells, and quebec premier robert bourassa
but the meetings, interspersed with advice from manitoba's legal and constitutional experts, were unable to bridge a fundamental disagreement between filmon and quebec's demands
federal officials maintained thursday that filmon upped his demands after his meetings with carstairs and doer, scuttling a near-agreement on the accord
but doer, reached at his hotel early this morning, denied he and carstairs were presented with any kind of tentative agreement
""""absolutely not, -per-cent no that's just not true,"""" he said
""""there was no filmon and wells saying to doer and carstairs 'this is what we're recommending'""""
carstairs also denied she killed the deal
unresolved demands
filmon has two unresolved key demands
first, he wants assurances that the charter of rights will not be weakened by quebec's special status in the constitution he also wants the canada clause, which would define canada's attributes as a nation
filmon said late thursday that quebec's refusal to discuss distinct society, """"directly or indirectly,"""" had created """"a critical situation""""
""""we want assurances the charter of rights is not impaired, and a vision of canada that is broader than distinct society; that first and foremost we are all canadians""""
a copy of manitoba's briefing paper to filmon, obtained by the citizen, revealed wide differences between the federal and manitoba positions on the canada clause at the eve of the conference
the proposed federal canada clause said the constitution """"reflects"""" attributes of the country, such as aboriginal peoples, multiculturalism, the distinct identity of quebec and the presence of linguistic minorities
but manitoba's strategy paper said the premier should push to have all those qualities described as a """"fundamental characteristic"""" of canada -- the same wording used to describe quebec's distinct society status
filmon's briefing document noted that this change was supplied to the federal government, but as the premier flew to ottawa on saturday, """"there has been no indication of the federal reaction""""
on wednesday, wells said the premiers had discussed placing charter guarantees in the canada clause, a possible compromise which would meet manitoba's concerns while leaving quebec's """"distinct society"""" clause untouched
but that proposal fell apart as negotiations began in earnest on thursday
by evening, wells was distancing himself from the manitoba position: """"it's no secret to anybody that mr filmon and i share many views,"""" he said, but added they did not have the same concerns, """"such as the canada clause, as such""""

``different embassies have different backlogs,'' waldman said
immigration canada has said that if the kats family applies for landed immigrant status through normal channels, they will be granted an interview by immigration staff, which not all applicants get, waldman said
during the time he has been in toronto, kats has earned the respect of many prominent canadians in the arts through performances he has given in churches, shelters, community centres and concert halls
last week, about  people came to hear him play at a farewell concert at st george the martyr anglican church in downtown toronto
both alexander and rimma kats have guaranteed paying jobs they have been doing voluntarily, as church pianists, once they have their papers
the congregation of st george the martyr has also guaranteed that the family will never become a burden to taxpayers
the kats family left russia in  and received refugee status in israel his father was jewish and his jewish surname led to discrimination and limited his career in russia, kats said
rimma kats, who is also an accomplished pianist, is a muslim
in israel, ``neither jewish, christian nor muslim communities wanted us,'' kats said in , the family came here and applied for refugee status

2530185146,Bill 96 is a much-needed defence of French,Aucun(e) disponible.,"premier françois legault's right-leaning coalition avenir québec government has just introduced the most sweeping language reform since rené lévesque startled the nation with the infamous bill  back in 
today's bill , formally entitled an act respecting french, the official and common language of québec, seeks to restore the french language unequivocally and unashamedly as one of the cornerstones of quebec society, and to mandate its use throughout la belle province
the usual suspects have sounded the alarm the bill will threaten minority rights, they say """"anglo-quebecers are being driven out of the province"""" is another trope that can be heard from all the familiar places
but contrary to the s, when french language protections were put forth by the separatist and nativist parti québécois and met with swift condemnation by federalists, today's bill  is unfolding in an altogether different political landscape all three major federal parties - the liberals, the conservatives, and the ndp - are supporting the bill or at least staying silent, as they curry support among mainstream quebec voters
bill  responds to a cascade of studies that indicate the use of french in quebec homes and workplaces has been declining steadily and is set for a precipitous fall in the coming decades the measures in the -page bill are varied and far-reaching: extending the reach of bill  to federal workplaces and businesses with  to  employees; requiring commercial signage to be predominantly in french; capping enrolment in english-speaking cegeps; providing additional french-language training opportunities; abandoning the bilingualism requirement for provincial judges; and requiring immigrants to communicate with public officials and entities in french upon arrival
we often hear about the rise of populism, and quebec is no exception if the election of the caq shows one thing, it is that there exists a cross-partisan desire to reinforce the cultural glue that holds quebec society together and a desire to integrate newcomers into a strong and unified french-speaking quebec identity
it would be foolish to view bill  as simply the modernday regurgitation of bill  quebec society has shifted considerably since the s this is not a reform destined to restore pure laine nostalgia, but one that seeks to build on the past while looking confidently toward the future
nothing better embodies this youthful, optimistic and newfound cultural confidence in quebec than the dashing young spokesperson for this reform a far cry from the wild-eyed, chain-smoking rené lévesque of yore asking his fellow citizens to reject change, bill 's lead proponent is simon jolin-barrette, a -year-old montreal lawyer turned minister of immigration, francization and integration, who personifies the newfound cultural and linguistic confidence of a proud and autonomous quebec within canada and the wider north american english-speaking continent
""""the protection and enhancement of the french language must become a matter for the state,"""" jolin-barrette recently declared, adding, """"french must be the language of administration, of course, but also of legislation and justice""""
this is a far cry from pierre trudeau's quebec and perhaps for the better an indigenous canadian, stewart kiff is the president of solstice public affairs in toronto he is a francophile and a leading advocate for many of ontario's french language organizations",The Kingston Whig-Standard,2021-05-21,2021,5,21

[...]it is resolved, this speculation and the allegations are a reputational issue for Brampton - it could be doing significant damage to our reputation.""""","  a $-million lawsuit still hangs over brampton city hall, council is wrestling over a future route for a lrt corridor, long-standing policing policies in one of canada's most diverse communities are being challenged by residents and plans for the city's first university need to be hammered out
these are some of the critical issues facing canada's ninth-largest city in 
some city hall watchers and councillors worry that the ongoing lawsuit launched by local builder inzola group against the city in , regarding the handling of a historic downtown redevelopment deal, is causing reputational harm and the possible loss of business as it drags through the courts
""""it's of the utmost importance that this matter be resolved in ,"""" said councillor john sprovieri, who has been critical of the city's handling of the six-year-old lawsuit, which mayor linda jeffrey said has """"paralyzed"""" city hall
""""a lot of people are following what's happening with this lawsuit,"""" sprovieri said
""""there is a lot of speculation and much of it is negative until it is resolved, this speculation and the allegations are a reputational issue for brampton - it could be doing significant damage to our reputation""""
after inzola was disqualified from bidding on the project, its lawsuit was filed, alleging bias against the local builder by senior city staff and former mayor susan fennell in the awarding of a $-million downtown redevelopment project
the city denies all the lawsuit's allegations
the city, responding to numerous questions from the star about the lawsuit throughout , did not address documents that had been filed with the court raising concerns about the conduct of senior staff involved in the selection process
the city stated that it had filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit """"in its entirety""""
in november, after more than , pages of documents supporting its case had been filed by inzola to fight the city's attempt at dismissing the lawsuit, the city abandoned its dismissal strategy, dropping its motion, and now the case is heading for trial
""""no one knows what really happened,"""" sprovieri said
""""we could be losing tens of millions of dollars in business because reputable firms might be concerned about getting involved with projects here we need to get this to trial as soon as possible now, to find out what happened and finally clear the air so the city can move on""""
early in , the ontario ombudsman is expected to release his findings after a broad investigation into brampton real estate and development dealings the probe could cause more controversy inside city hall and force changes to the way the city does business ombudsman paul dube stated in the spring, after his team's initial inquiry, that """"we determined that the issue of non-competitive procurements could potentially have systemic implications on the city, its staff and its citizens""""
the sweeping investigation, called after brampton council raised concerns about the procurement for the redevelopment deal and other possible systemic problems inside city hall, is being conducted by a team from the ombudsman's office that has had access to all documents and staff inside city hall for much of the year the investigation will not, however, deal with matters related to the downtown deal that are subject to the ongoing litigation
on the transit front, early in , city staff is expected to present council with more details for a future lrt corridor after it voted against the province's preferred route along main st in  staff is looking at council's chosen alternatives along either kennedy rd or mclaughlin rd concerns have been raised about how much work has been done on the file, particularly after more than  managers, including some top bureaucrats, were suddenly dismissed by the city recently
chris drew, co-founder of the group fight gridlock in brampton, who advocated for the scrapped main st route, says lessons were learned from that lrt debate, which bogged down council for the better part of a year and divided many in the city
""""i'm hopeful that the city can learn and grow,"""" he said, adding that he expects staff to report on the only two lrt routes now on the table early in the year asked if council and the city might again get mired in an exhaustive debate over which of the two routes to back, drew said the city can't afford to get into another acrimonious battle while traffic congestion gets worse every day
""""it's not healthy for brampton to make things personal""""
drew said council can make a decision on the future route early in , when staffers present findings on the two corridors being considered this, drew said, will allow the city to start advocating for funding from higher levels of government and get the project moving
along with better transit for the city, residents have also been clamouring for a university presence - it is the largest city in canada without one in october, the province saved brampton from having to fight with milton over the selection for just one new university - the liberal government announced it will award one campus to each municipality along with $ million in combined funding
now, residents are wondering what work has been done to select a campus location, who the university acting as brampton's required partner will be and where the money will come from, beyond the city's share of the $ million, to build the city's first university campus all of these issues will have to be tackled by staff missing many key personnel in the management ranks
mayor jeffrey said that while the province's decision is a welcome one, it means more work but also more potential opportunities because the scope of the proposal has been greatly widened
""""whereas before we were really limited to ontario partnerships, the province is really expanding that reach  we now can look beyond an ontario partner""""
jeffrey said that while the principal university partner has to be ontario-based, the city is now going to start working with the province to find other post-secondary partnerships, even possibly overseas, that tie in with the local economy and the desires of brampton residents who want specific types of educational opportunities in a rapidly transforming economy
she says the work about to be done to build the city's first university campus could """"transform the region
""""it's early days, but i'm very excited about it""""
another key issue facing brampton, where more than two-thirds of residents are visible minorities, is the future of policing, specifically policies surrounding racial profiling and diversity within the force after the force's own data was published by the star in , showing black individuals were three times more likely to be carded by peel police than white people, mayor jeffrey voiced strong opposition to the practice in her role as a police services board member overseeing the force
jeffrey has also supported a broad equity-diversity audit of peel police, which in  will probe whether or not its hiring and promotion practices are equitable and reflect the demographics in one of canada's most diverse regions
police chief jennifer evans, who refused the board's request to suspend carding (after the board voted in  to do so) and challenged the board on how it handled its decision to launch the equity-diversity audit, is in the last year of her contract jeffrey and the rest of the board will have to decide in  whether to keep evans on as chief after almost two years of tension between her and the board

that it took this long for the cbc - and rogers-owned sportsnet, which took over the """"hockey night in canada"""" broadcast in  - to come to their senses (over dollars) is a question that deserves better answers than monday's canning of -year-old cherry
i suppose this is where the tall tv foreheads decided to draw the line, but only after caterwauling from coast to coast and on social media
because this is no longer the canada of , when cherry was put on a seven-second delay after another rant about the country declining to join the coalition war in iraq, and, full disclosure, i agreed with him (where was that delay on saturday, though?)
it's not the canada that went bonkers - but only in parts, and ignored - when cherry slandered french-canadian players and european players and russian players
it's not the canada that chuckled when cherry mocked flamboyant players by putting on a lisping pansy accent
he was out of time, out of step, if not necessarily out of his element on hnic because a whole lot of fans are going to miss him a great deal, can't deny that
""""i could have kept my job if i had apologized and changed,"""" cherry told me in a phone call monday night """"i would rather go out on my shield, the way i am i can't change to be a simp on coach's corner because people wouldn't recognize if i had to do that stuff to keep my job, i'd rather get fired no, i don't regret a thing and if people want to interpret it, what i said, i guess that's my problem""""
cherry has a long history of tirades against targets du jour that divided a nation, because, frankly, there were as many who loved him as loathed him still are, judging by the steamy pile of cherry rah-rah trending on twitter with the hashtag """"don cherry is right""""
right about what, i'd ask the cherry collective right in being an unvarnished bigot? right in being the old guy jumping on his lawn and shaking a fist at the world? the unrepentant jacked-up patriot who slimed """"you people"""" - immigrants - as insufficiently respectful of vets on the slapdash measurement not enough people wearing remembrance day poppies?
""""you people love, that come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life you love our milk and honey at least you should pay a couple of bucks for a poppy or something like that,"""" cherry intoned on air in saturday's coach's corner then, stabbing a finger toward the camera: """"these guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in canada these guys paid the biggest price""""
you people not so tacitly, non-white canadians, immigrant canadians, refugees from war cherry specifically mentioned downtown toronto and mississauga, where he lives, as poppy-light toronto and mississauga, where half of the population self-identifies as a visible minority, according to the latest census data
perhaps this is what really unnerves the cherry he's an anachronism, pining for days when canadians were white and of anglo stock - except for that francophone rump in quebec when men were men and hockey enforcers roamed the rinks and multiculturalism was scarcely a gleam in prime minister pierre elliott trudeau's eye
the codger with the collars clearly had no compunction about trashing """"the other,"""" while straight man ron maclean sat by like the sock puppet he is, even offering a thumbs-up at the end of cherry's spiel certainly he doesn't sound contrite, if insisting his words were misinterpreted
""""i want everybody to wear a poppy i'm out among the soldiers, i walk the walk, i've been to our bases and visited the troops, at christmas i was over in afghanistan i have a feeling for the soldier and when i see people just walking by the guys selling poppies  well, i make no apologies""""
he adds: """"i was referring to everybody i should have used that instead of 'you people' as soon as you say 'you people,' everybody jumped aboard that but i said it, i meant every word of it and i stand by my word""""
the canadian broadcasting standards council was inundated with complaints about cherry's remarks
""""the cbsc has received a large number of very similar complaints concerning coach's corner broadcast on cbc (sportsnet) on nov , , exceeding the cbsc's technical processing capacities,"""" the organization posted on its website """"accordingly, while the cbsc will be dealing with this broadcast under its normal process, it is not able to accept any further complaints""""
sportsnet didn't wait for that, president bart yabsley issuing a statement monday, in the wake of a more mealy mouthed statement sunday
""""sports brings people together - it unites us, not divides us following further discussions with don cherry after saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down during the broadcast he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for""""
long past time, actually
some  years removed from his nhl coaching career and a hnic fixture for nearly as long, cherry has used his platform to relentlessly promote his own view of humanity around the edges of hockey expertise somewhere along the line, probably because his bosses were never firm that cherry was hired to talk hockey - not current events, not ideology, not regressive intolerance - he became an icon to the apparently humbled masses yearning to break free of encroaching political correctness
he wore his intransigence on the sleeve of his crazy suit jackets
and, yes, many who serve in canada's military revere cherry and clamored to have their photo taken with him on the many occasions he flew over to mingle with the troops in afghanistan i don't criticize them for that cherry was a star in their midst he championed them tirelessly but, especially on saturday, he also implicated soldiers - the living and the dead - by making them party to his screed
a man who has never served, but fancies himself an amateur military historian, conveniently neglected the countless immigrants, the sons and daughters of immigrants, indigenous, generations-old minority clans who fought for canada in two world wars and serve under arms today, up to and including defence minister sajjan, born in punjab, son of sikh police constable sajjan was generous enough to cast cherry's comments as a """"teachable moment""""
on sunday, sajjan tweeted: """"last night, don cherry made comments that are wrong in describing canadians' remembrance of our veterans his remarks don't recognize the contribution of canada's diverse communities i hope we can turn this into a moment where we can learn about all who have served""""
this wasn't, as many have tried to frame cherry's stream of invective, a matter of free speech, yoking charter rights to mean-spirited commentary, clumping in his remarks with the recent controversy over the toronto public library's laudable insistence on allowing a widely disparaged speaker to appear at one of their branches, or even the """"wexit"""" movement arising from western canada's alienation following the national election
cherry is perfectly free to spew as he wishes but he can't do it from the hnic pulpit, on the public airwaves, as an outsized broadcasting personality with a huge audience i'm no fan of """"cancel culture"""" and pious big-footing, but enough is enough
he's never apologized in his life, made a virtue of that obstinacy i'm not surprised he won't offer a """"sorry"""" now, in the moment of his ignominious fall
so we go forward, hopefully taking with us all that's good about canada in , leaving behind all that's not coach's corner will surely survive (brian burke, come on down!)
""""it's tough, but that's the way it is,"""" said cherry, who had no suggestion for who might assume his seat on coach's corner
""""nobody can succeed me,"""" he chortles down the line """"somebody's going to try, but nobody will and that's the way i feel""""

The Constitution currently recognizes that any program designed to bring about employment equity may be considered valid and constitutional even though on the face of it, such a program may be seen to be violating the equality provisions in the Constitution.","new constitution must reflect canada's multicultural diversity
following are excerpts from a brief presented in toronto tuesday to the parliamentary committee on the constitution by former liberal mpp murad velshi of the canada for all committee, a group of canadians of south asian origins concerned about the impact of a new constitution on visible minorities
the federal government has proposed that the charter of rights shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and promotion of quebec as a distinct society
although we recognize and accept official bilingualism and quebec's unique position within canada, such distinctness should not derogate from the rights of individuals
the distinct society clause should not empower the courts to take away rights of linguistic, racial and religious minorities, along with women's rights, to equal treatment
as well, distinct society should not be interpreted in a way that enables quebec to have increasing power and control over areas of fundamental importance to minority groups, such as immigration and citizenship
visible minorities have the right to work freely and live equally and to move freely in any part of our country and if the inclusion of a distinct society clause would in any way compromise those rights, then we would have great difficulty in supporting such a clause
we do not agree with a two-nation concept of canada and propose the constitutional recognition of the aboriginal peoples as distinct societies that constitute a fundamental characteristic of canada
the constitution must promote a view that does not ignore the first founding peoples of canada
we agree in principle that the aboriginal peoples have an inherent right to be self-governing based on their historical presence on the land the aboriginal peoples are in the best position to define the concept of """"self-government""""    
there is only one reference to multiculturalism in the constitution and it is in section  of the charter of rights: """"this charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of canadians""""
in its latest proposal, the federal government suggests a """"canada clause,"""" which only recognizes multiculturalism in reference to """"the building of a strong canada of peoples from many cultures and lands""""
this recommendation fails to recognize the multicultural, multilingual and multiracial diversity of canadian society
it also fails to specifically recognize the equality of all races it simply recognizes the equality of women and men since the government of canada proposes that the canada clause acknowledges who we are as a people and who we aspire to be, it is crucial that the clause also recognize racial equality as a fundamental value of canadian society
therefore, we recommend language similar to that found in the preamble to the federal multiculturalism act: """"the government of canada recognizes the diversity of canadians as regards race, national or ethnic origin, color, creed and religion as a fundamental characteristic of canadian society and is committed to the enhancement of the multicultural heritage of canadians in working to achieve the equality of all canadians in the economic, social, cultural and political life of canada""""   
the constitution currently recognizes that any program designed to bring about employment equity may be considered valid and constitutional even though on the face of it, such a program may be seen to be violating the equality provisions in the constitution
there is, however, no pro-active provision either encouraging employment equity or requiring employers or even the governments in canada to follow the principles of employment equity
we believe that the constitution should promote employment equity through a constitutional provision that is pro-active in nature    
(on senate reform), the federal document proposes setting aside some seats for aboriginal peoples but there is no reference to seats for other minorities who may never have the opportunity to sit in the senate without reserved seats
it is, therefore, our position that the idea of reserved seats has merit but it must extend to all disadvantaged groups and not only aboriginal groups",Toronto Star,1991-11-01,1991,11,1
2270007635,"Rich school, poor school: Private money affects Ottawa's public education system",Aucun(e) disponible.,"at charles h hulse ps, the school council's budget was $, last year, collected from provincial government grants that helped pay for a multicultural potluck supper, a family night so parents could see how their children learned math, and a hot-dog day many of the children at the school on alta vista drive are newcomers - council meetings are translated into arabic, somali and nepali - whose parents cannot afford to contribute money to the council
across town at broadview public school in mckellar park, the school council raised $, in -, the latest year data is available a dance-a-thon, silent auction, book sale and other fundraising events ensured the council could purchase everything from chromebooks to yoga lessons for kindergarteners
parents have always peddled pizza lunches and staged bake sales to raise a few dollars for their children's school but the amount of cash collected by elementary school councils at ottawa's largest public school board is substantial councils at elementary schools reported revenue totalling $ million in -
the privately-raised money is poured into """"extras"""" like field trips and art workshops but it also pays for what some might consider basics, from library books to science equipment and play structures
in neighbourhoods where parents can contribute and have the skills and contacts to more easily raise money, students reap the benefits the fundraising slows to a trickle at schools in low-income neighbourhoods
the discrepancy between schools is huge, an analysis by the citizen shows
the lowest revenue reported was at arch street public school in southeast ottawa, which took in $
eight school councils reported $, or less a year in revenue half of those schools, including arch street, don't even have councils, but the schools received government grants that would normally be given to councils to foster parent participation and small projects
on the other end of the spectrum, five school councils in ottawa raised more than $,
(see how individual schools ranked here( https://docsgooglecom/spreadsheets/d/dnqsqikvsxshalqarjuotiqrrnmdkal/edit?usp=sharing ))
akhile takes a look at many of the comic books available for sale at the rd annual rockcliffe park book fair the popular event raised $, for the school council last year
a citizen analysis of four years of statistics going back to - shows similar trends, with annual revenue from school councils ranging from as little as $ to as high as $,
in order to examine how private money affects the public education landscape in ottawa, the citizen spent months collecting data on  elementary schools for the - academic year, using statistics supplied by the school board, supplemented by interviews with school council members and minutes of council meetings because schools with higher enrollment can be expected to raise more, we also calculated the amount raised by each council per student broadview, for example, may have raised the most money, but it's also the largest school in the board with just over , students rockcliffe park public school raised the most per student, at $, while the lowest was again arch street, which reported revenue of $ per student
it's a snapshot of one year, and there are some anomalies in the data some councils reported unusually high revenue that year, for instance, because they received grants for a major project such as a new play structure or because of lunch programs that bring in a lot of revenue but have a much lower net profit
but the data give a broad indication of the disparity in fundraising - and reveal what critics describe as a tiered public education system, one which further reinforces the disparity that exists between children whose parents have varying levels of income and education
and the gap in fundraising, critics say, also lets the province off the hook for funding education and forces principals and teachers at schools in less affluent neighbourhoods to spend time applying for government and private grants so their students can have a playground or take field trips
""""there's an inequity that happens when schools in more affluent communities are able to fundraise, while schools in less affluent areas never could,"""" says erica braunovan, a trustee at the ottawa-carleton district school board who co-hosted a  meeting on the topic with former-trustee-turned-capital-ward-coun shawn menard
""""it creates an inequity in the educational experience of students,"""" she says """"the educational experience should be the same across the province we shouldn't have some schools that have one chromebook for every four students and one school that has chromebooks for every second student""""
principal irene cameron at the kindergarten playground at carson grove
the situation in ottawa reflects a wider trend at schools across the province
the  report by the public-education advocacy group people for education found that the top  per cent of fundraising elementary schools raised  times the amount raised by the bottom  per cent; the previous year it was  times as much the group has been tracking fundraising at schools through an annual survey for two decades, and the amounts continue to climb at elementary schools (the survey includes all types of fundraising, but in elementary schools most of the money is raised by school councils)
the issue is key at a time when the provincial conservative government is making spending cuts, including reducing the grants allotted to educate each pupil
however, exactly how deep funding cuts will be in future budgets is unknown - and educators can only guess at how funding gaps created by private fundraising will grow in the coming years
and this leads to a variety of pertinent questions around an issue that is both complicated and controversial
what is the value of school council fundraising? can or should it fill any gaps in government funding? and what can be done about the fundraising disparity between schools in rich and poor neighbourhoods?
parents can't be faulted for helping their children by volunteering for the school council, says annie kidder, the executive director for people for education
""""it's a great, amazing job that parents do on school councils, to make the school the best it can be and a big part of that appears to be fundraising,"""" she says
""""the thing about fundraising is that it is a very easy to understand way to be involved in your child's school it can be fun things like the spring fair, or whatever, are great community events""""
however, kidder says it becomes problematic when there is such a variance between schools that can raise virtually nothing and those that can raise $, or in some cases as much as $, a year
""""that is when we start to worry about the basic principle of public education, which is that every child is supposed to have a fairly equitable chance to succeed, and equitable access to a similar quality of education""""
at the ottawa-carleton district school board, the top  per cent of fundraising school councils raised  times as much as the bottom ten per cent in -, our analysis found
at rockcliffe park public school, in ottawa's toniest neighbourhood, the school council reported $, in revenue in - that is $ for each student
the money ensured all students at rockcliffe park enjoyed a trip to the ottawa children's festival; paid for $, worth of books and reading resources for the library and classrooms; and provided a subsidy of nearly $, for the graduation ceremony and trip to montreal for grade  students, among other things
rockcliffe park's council also spends money to help needier schools, including six $, grants to schools for literacy programs
the council's largest fundraiser is a book fair that attracts people from across the city the fair raised $, that year
queen elizabeth public school is only four kilometres away on st laurent boulevard, but it's in another universe when it comes to fundraising
queen elizabeth's council reported $, in revenue in - that is $ per student the council revenue included $, in provincial government grants, according to minutes of council meetings that give a glimpse into activities that year parents sold baked goods at a movie night and raised $ council spent $ to buy pizza for meet the teacher night and lunch snacks for students a charitable foundation subsidized a """"scientists in the school"""" event one evening
at one meeting, the queen elizabeth council decided to spend $ a month for three months to buy fruit for the school's breakfast club, then """"evaluate the success of this approach""""
some parents from schools in wealthier areas who attended the  meeting trustee braunovan co-sponsored to discuss disparity in school council fundraising were surprised at the wide gap between schools, she says the goal was to raise awareness of the issue among members of the public and candidates for school board trustee, braunovan says
participant larry shamash says it worked
""""it opened my eyes to the inequities,"""" says shamash, the current co-chair of the council at elmdale public school in the hampton park neighbourhood
elmdale council, which reported $, in revenue in -, has a strong tradition of parental involvement, he says """"we have a lot of great parents who put so much time into the school""""
some of the fundraising disparity is due to momentum, with some schools having a strong history of fundraising, shamash says
however, the """"unfortunate truth"""" is that in richer neighbourhoods parents have more money and time to devote to school council, he says
at the meeting he met council members from schools where """"parents were struggling just to make the budget for paper, for photocopying  they were working two jobs, some of them had a day shift, they had a night shift, they were just unable to put the time in""""
the fundraising disparity is not healthy or fair, says shamash it raises wider issues
""""surely the question is: why should school councils really be needed to raise money? councils are there to help direct some of the education and the issues around the school, but suddenly they raise a little bit of cash and for whatever reason, funding from the ministry is not there, and all of a sudden it becomes a necessary part of the school and i wonder whether that is really something that should be happening""""
melissa jennings, the current chair of the school council at york street public school, says the meeting made her realize """"how far behind we were""""
""""we are just trying to get a few people to a meeting and they have these big organizations with very engaged parents they were planning a lot of extras, when we are just trying to get the minimum""""
at york street, that means ensuring that students have food and warm clothes and """"stay at some level near their peers in math,"""" she says
it's difficult to raise money because many of the parents at the school have so little, she says in - the council reported $, in revenue, most from a fundraiser hosted by a boston pizza franchise in barrhaven that wanted to help the money subsidized a trip to montreal for graduating students
""""this year we didn't want to do fundraisers,"""" says jennings """"we weren't in the position to do it, and we didn't have a treasurer""""
the council decided instead to work on convincing parents it was important to have """"a voice at the table"""" on education issues, such as the board's plan to collect identity-data about students and funding cuts by the provincial government, she says
at vincent massey public school on smyth road fundraising is difficult, says kate connolly, co-chair of the council it's a mixed income community, and many parents can't afford to contribute much cash, she says
a council movie night might bring in $, says connolly the biggest earner is the """"do nothing fundraiser"""" """"basically we tell parents we will not make them sell cookies, or ice cream, if they just give us money we usually raise around $, a year on that""""
vincent massey council raised $, in - connolly gasps when told some school councils take in more than $,
""""i have a real problem with it  i mean, what do they need that money for? it seems an unfair distribution of wealth in a public school system, for sure""""
her council's priority is to improve the school library, says connolly """"there is no technology in it, there are no computers it's an old school with a s library and the books in it are also from the s
""""oh my, it's so funny, my son, who is in grade , what he brings home to read he brings home original nancy drew books! he said they are the most interesting things to him that's crazy!""""
not that she has anything against nancy drew, connolly laughs """"i mean, there is just not a huge stock of new books""""
council would also like to install a maker space that might include robotics, electrical circuits and other things for the students to create it would """"help fill in the gaps for kids who don't have that stuff at home,"""" she says but a maker space might cost as much as $,, a lot of money to fundraise for a """"not super affluent"""" school
""""we have a thousand plans if we raise a lot of money we are going to put in a maker space, cool things like that if we don't raise very much money at all we are going to buy a bunch of books and comfortable chairs to sit on""""
the school councils that raise the least tend to be in the poorest areas of town, the citizen found
vincent massey is one of  elementary schools designated by the board to receive extra funding and support to compensate for the disadvantages faced by their students the raise (resource allocation index based on socio-economics) index considers such factors as poverty, the number of single parents, students learning english as a second language, absenteeism and """"readiness to learn"""" among students
our analysis found that school councils that raised the least money were predominantly raise schools ten of the  schools that raised the lowest amount, in both total revenue and revenue per students, have raise designations
at carson grove elementary school in gloucester, where half of the students are syrian refugees, it's not realistic to raise money from parents, says principal irene cameron
""""it's through no fault of their own new canadians come, they are adjusting to the new country new families here are struggling sometimes they are working at jobs at night, and they are looking after their families and they don't have cars, so it's hard to get to the school""""
there is no school council, but cameron and her staff fundraise, applying for grants and soliciting funds from the province, charities, businesses and local mosques to pay for playgrounds, field trips and musical instruments in - the school reported income of $,, made up of $, in government grants and a $, donation
cameron proudly shows off a $, kindergarten playground built a few years ago with grants from the school board, city and charities
field trips are another priority
many parents at the school can't take their kids to museums, the nac or experimental farm, she says """"they have four or five kids, so even if they had a car they couldn't do that
""""we try to give these kids the kind of experiences every kid should have, but they can't afford it""""
she likes to take graduating grade  children on a day of downhill skiing, a middle-class canadian activity they would not otherwise experience
""""it's kind of sad, because they say, 'oh miss, can we come one more time? one more time? go down the big hill?'
""""but at least they have the experience once""""
at charles h hulse, council chair david monch says most parents are new immigrants (according to data from eqao, the provincial testing agency,  per cent of the grade  students at the school in - were learning english as a second language) parents may not be able to contribute financially, but they are keenly interested in the school, monch says
as many as  parents have shown up at meetings, which are translated into three languages parents have lots of questions, from the school routines to how to prepare their children for provincial testing, he says
kate connolly, a parent on the vincent massey public school council, with her son, ethan wigston, who just finished grade 
school staff and other officials also provide advice about life in canada, from the requirement to wear a bicycle helmet to the importance of warm clothing in winter, he says
the charles h hulse council does no fundraising however, a $, upgrade to the school library this year, including a maker space with a lego wall and robotics equipment, was paid for with private funds principal laurie kavanagh, with help from a retired couple, applied for grants from private and charitable organizations
kavanagh is proud the school offers field trips, sports teams, clubs and other experiences """"our students are learning and smiling while they do it""""
what can school councils raise money for?
provincial guidelines say school fundraising should complement, not replace, public funding for schools
school councils are not supposed to fundraise for items already provided through provincial grants, """"such as classroom learning materials, textbooks and repairs or for capital projects that significantly increase operating costs,"""" say the guidelines
critics say the guidance is vague
school councils in ottawa raise money for technology such as chromebooks and ipads, as well as for library and classroom books and online learning tools
not to mention a wide variety of science-related equipment, from grow towers that teach kids about hydroponic gardening to pulleys, sports equipment of all types and classroom supplies
what, exactly, are """"learning materials?"""" wonders kate wigston, co-chair of the school council at viscount alexander
chromebooks, for instance, a popular item for council fundraising, are an important tool for children with learning disabilities, she says some of the other things the viscount alexander council has purchased over the last couple of years: stationary bikes, volleyballs, a hockey net, basketballs, baseball gloves, hula hoops, skipping ropes, pylons, bean bags, bocce balls, gymnastic dance ribbons, recorders, a set of drums, a glockenspiel and gears and pulleys for science classes
""""i would argue that all of this is learning material,"""" says wigston """"gears and pulleys are learning material and how am i going to learn volleyball without a volleyball?""""
whatever is essential, she suggests, should be provided by the school that view is echoed by trustee braunovan, who says the solution to inequitable fundraising is for the province to provide more money
""""if we fully funded schools we wouldn't have any need for fundraising""""
braunovan says field trips should be part of the educational experience for everyone, for example
currently, in less affluent communities students may have fewer and less expensive trips, and are forced to rely on funding from grants and """"fairy godparents,"""" she says
""""it's kind of at the whim of the goodwill of others, and that is not right""""
children play on the new play structure at viscount alexander public school school council raised money and got grants to have it built after the last one was torn down after being deemed unsafe
of course, that opens up the question of what is essential in the province's schools are field trips an essential part of learning? how about play structures?
kidder's organization has recommended that, for starters, the provincial government update its guidelines to """"clearly and concretely articulate what should be present in all schools, at no cost to parents""""
arts enrichment, extracurricular activities like field trips and sports and technology all help students """"develop the competencies they need for long-term success,"""" says people for education in a public school system, that means all children - not just those whose parents can afford it - should have access to such """"foundational learning opportunities and supports,"""" the group recommends
the debate also raises questions about the role of school councils
while parent-teacher organizations have existed for decades, the provincial government decreed back in  that all schools should have councils that would include not only parents but members of the community as well as a student (for high schools), the principal, a teacher and another staff member
it was a response to recommendations in a royal commission on learning report that said councils would help increase accountability and link schools with the community
councils, for instance, advise principals and school boards on issues such as curriculum, school budget priorities, assessment, selection of principals, school codes of behaviour and the school calendar; help develop a sense of community with parents; and report back to the community about what is going on at school
but events that also raise money can also help build a sense of community, too
greg rallo, chair of the council at vimy ridge public school, says he's met many parents at school council-sponsored events like barbecues and movie nights, which bring people together
the vimy ridge council also hosted a day-long """"spring fling"""" in may where parents and neighbours could buy plants, enjoy muffins and coffee and chat """"it goes well beyond enriching the lives of students we are enriching the lives of the community here""""
the vimy ridge council reported $, in revenue in - the council has spent money on dance lessons, an online reading platform and a maker space with a lego wall and marble run, among other things, as well as putting money aside for a play structure
but rallo says he's most proud of a council-funded speaker series that brought first nations, inuit and metis speakers into every classroom to talk about their culture, traditions, and for older students, the legacy of residential schools
his youngest daughter, in kindergarten, came home excitedly telling him about """"grandma irene's"""" stories of hunting and gathering and setting rabbit snares, he says
""""it's something i feel is a gaping hole in our curriculum it's a gap in our nation's history that isn't spoken about enough""""
rallo says the issue of disparity in fundraising hasn't been raised yet at his council, but he would strongly support any initiative that would encourage more affluent councils to contribute to needier schools
that already happens at many of the top-fundraising schools, including broadview, rockcliffe park, a lorne cassidy and elmdale, which all contribute money or goods to needier schools
perhaps school councils could contribute to a central fund managed by the school board that could redistribute the money to needy schools, suggests rallo
""""that would be spectacular""""
cathy abraham, the president of the ontario public school boards' association, says her home board of kawartha-pine ridge based in peterborough has just such a fund
disparity in fundraising is """"huge issue,"""" says abraham however, she says revised provincial guidelines are not needed
""""i believe that school boards should be allowed to make the decisions that are necessary for their local needs local school boards are in the best place to understand the needs of the local community""""
and she maintains that fundraising disparities do not erode the quality of public education """"absolutely not""""
""""because we have a very, very good public education system in ontario school council fundraising does not have an impact on whether a school board can deliver quality education every student in ontario is still receiving a quality education, whether or not they are receiving pizza days every saturday, it doesn't mean they aren't getting a good education""""
kidder says there is another dynamic at work that fuels the school fundraising machine, especially in more affluent neighbourhoods
it's emotion, and perhaps social pressure on parents """"if i'm a good parent i will fundraise for my child's school""""
there is also an assumption that fundraising is required, she says
""""it's hard to know if there is a reality here funding for education over the last several years has increased overall is it a reality that schools need to fundraise? they definitely rely on it
""""there are a lot of grey areas in this which comes first - a kind of drive among parents of a certain socio-economic status to say 'i want to have the best of everything for my child?' or the pressure on schools to try to provide things that are outside of the core? it may be a mix of all those things""""

Since the 1950s, television and an improved national education system have infused formal Italian into the rural villages of Ciociaria. [...]the dialect changes slightly from town to town, depending on the level of exposure to formal Italian, according to Gianni Blasi, a retired Italian linguistics professor from Ciociaria. Towns in the valleys, where the main roads run through, have seen much more outside influence than the towns secluded on hilltops, he said. [...]of the 2,400 immigrants who came to Sarnia in that period, 1,000 are from the Ciociaria region, according to one estimate from the 1990s. Because the majority of the people who came from Ciociaria had little education, they didn't have the opportunity to """"lose their dialect,"""" Iannozzi said. To test the theory, Iannozzi is planning to travel to Italy to interview Ciociaro speakers there, and compare that version of the dialect to the one in Sarnia. Constant exposure to Canadian English has produced its own set of changes. Since most came from rural Italy in the 1950s, the dialect has adopted some English words for modern things that weren't around at the time. Michael, a linguist at Western University, is trying to preserve his grandmother's Italian dialect from the region of Ciociaria, a cluster of towns in the hills of southern Lazio, between Naples and Rome, before it fully disappears.","in the afternoons, the round tables at the dante club are used for scopa it is a vexing card game, played so intensely by the older gentlemen at this volunteer-run bocce hall here, that management has put up signs: """"no foul language""""

so michael iannozzi, a sarnia-born linguistics student whose grandparents came from ciociaria, is devoting his phd work at western university to recording his hometown's specific brand of the dialect before the ones who speak it are gone
ciociaro is so distinct that someone who speaks only formal italian can barely understand it, save for a few common words here and there iannozzi's sister, he said, spent months overseas learning italian, hoping she could communicate with her grandmother, who speaks the dialect
""""grandma had no idea what she was talking about,"""" he said
""""my grandma was like, where did you send her?"""" the dialect is likely headed for extinction in italy, too since the s, television and an improved national education system have infused formal italian into the rural villages of ciociaria the young people there rarely speak the dialect anymore
the dialect is still spoken in windsor, not just among the older people born in ciociaria, but also their nowadult children, said ciociaro club of windsor vice-president anna vozza
""""when all of my friends get together, we still speak dialect, especially if you're around the older people it's out of respect for them, right?"""" she also credits the club with maintaining the ciociaro traditions today, the club has more than , members whose families came from one of the ciociaria area's  regions
""""it came together because of the vision the people had, they wanted to put a dream together for their children, to hold onto their roots,"""" vozza said, citing the many programs run at the club, from language instruction to cooking classes to teach traditional plates, such as the italian-style bagel called the ciambelle
vozza said as a kid growing up in windsor, she felt unlike other kids who went to florida to see mickey mouse instead, she and other ciociaro kids went to italy to visit their grandparents """"now i get it, because all that culture, all that history was priceless,"""" she said
the encroachment of formal italian has led to a splintering of the dialect - so there's not a single version of ciociaro instead, the dialect changes slightly from town to town, depending on the level of exposure to formal italian, according to gianni blasi, a retired italian linguistics professor from ciociaria towns in the valleys, where the main roads run through, have seen much more outside influence than the towns secluded on hilltops, he said
""""when you move from town to town,"""" blasi said, """"you realize something's changing, something's going on
""""it's a heritage, which is slowly, slowly, slowly being watered down and in a few years it will start evaporating
it's a slow but irreversible process""""
for iannozzi, it all means that the version of the dialect he's studying in sarnia could be better preserved than it is in italy, since it hasn't been constantly bombarded by formal italian it's as if the dialect is frozen, he said
after the devastation of the second world war, italians looked outside of the country for work when one immigrant landed in sarnia, they were allowed to sponsor a friend or relative to join them through that chain migration, sarnia ended up with an italian immigrant population almost exclusively from ciociaria in fact, of the , immigrants who came to sarnia in that period, , are from the ciociaria region, according to one estimate from the s
because the majority of the people who came from ciociaria had little education, they didn't have the opportunity to """"lose their dialect,"""" iannozzi said
to test the theory, iannozzi is planning to travel to italy to interview ciociaro speakers there, and compare that version of the dialect to the one in sarnia
it's not likely that the language in sarnia is completely unadulterated, however constant exposure to canadian english has produced its own set of changes since most came from rural italy in the s, the dialect has adopted some english words for modern things that weren't around at the time
""""they have no one bringing in those words that they didn't pick up,"""" iannozzi said """"so there's just gaps and those gaps get filled with english, or what they call italiese - these english words that you make sound italian-ish""""
so, the word """"garage"""" becomes """"garagio""""
there are pockets of immigrants from ciociaria elsewhere in canada, including in windsor and toronto but sarnia's tight-knit community of ciociaro speakers means it's less likely that other italian dialects, from other immigrants, have infiltrated
iannozzi has a more practical reason for focusing on sarnia: his grandparents were among the wave of italians who settled here in the late s
""""they hear my last name and they say, 'well, ok, we'll see what this person's about,'"""" he said """"it's allowed me to have lot of access that i wouldn't have had to a community that generally just doesn't really talk to english people""""
he hopes to interview  people in sarnia, and catalogue their photos, letters, recorded interviews and stories in western university's archive of dialects and languages so far, he's interviewed 
each interviewee, including iannozzi's grandmother, reads from a long list of words designed to highlight the differences between ciociaro and formal italian
(one of the most noticeable differences is that the sound for v in ciociaro sounds like a w, so the word for wine - vino - sounds like wino other words, however, are completely different from formal italian)
""""it gets pretty personal,"""" iannozzi said
most of the people he has interviewed knew his late grandfather
one man sends produce from his garden with iannozzi to give to his grandmother several of the people he has interviewed have since died
""""as a kid, it was always hard to talk to my grandparents, because of the language barrier and because they came from such a different experience from anything i understood,"""" he said
""""to be honest, until i was about  i didn't really appreciate it
""""part of the work that i do is kind of absolving myself of not respecting it as much as i should have""""
""""it's like he's holding onto his heritage,"""" said caroline di cocco, a former ontario liberal mpp from sarnia, who has helped iannozzi make connections in the first-generation immigrant community
she was born in ciociaria, immigrated to canada when she was six and has written at length about the italian diaspora in her region
she said iannozzi's fascination with his roots is part of a larger trend in the third generation
the italian-canadian community in sarnia has swayed between two cultures for three generations
the first seemed to have held onto their dialect and to centres like the dante club as a bulwark against a sometimes hostile english-canadian mainstream culture but the second generation dealt with those pressures differently, trying to fit in with their schoolmates
""""my mom made homemade bread because we couldn't afford to buy it,"""" di cocco said
""""and she'd make cutlets or something and put them in i didn't have peanut butter and jam you're embarrassed, you wanted to fit in
""""it took a long time to accept the fact that i'm both (canadian and italian)""""
most of the second generation only used the dialect to talk to their parents, if they learned it at all
few in the third generation can speak it but they're trying to reembrace that culture, though it isn't something they grew up with
the dialect, however, will die with the first generation
""""it's quite sad, for me,"""" di cocco said """"it was how thousands and thousands of people expressed themselves for hundreds of years and now it's irrelevant, unimportant
""""but we are important""""

representatives from statistics canada were in sudbury a while back to speak to the greater sudbury chamber of commerce on the results of the latest census figures
the session was particularly interesting for those of us in the investment community who discovered just how these figures provided insight into sudbury past and present economic realities
sudbury has the largest number of residents of any major community in canada employed in the mining industry
it is no secret that the health of this industry is reflected in the local economy sudbury also serves as somewhat of a barometer for the entire canadian resource-based economy with commodity prices low, and value-based industries generally out of favour with investors, the canadian stock market has underperformed relative to the american marketplace over the past several years
statistics canada figures revealed that sudbury has the third- largest bilingual population of any canadian city montreal and hull- ottawa are the only two centres with marginally greater percentages this is undoubtedly one of the factors contributing to the attractiveness of this community for the new information based technologies
a well-educated bilingual work force, supported by an advanced infrastructure, can be a magnet for future development and subsequent job opportunities
investment markets are currently favouring the high-technology sector, and will likely continue to do so as we move into the millennium
unemployment still high
what can be learned from stats-can figures? from an historical perspective, we can see that our unemployment rate has traditionally been high for the past  years, relative to ontario as a whole
this has been a period marked by increased technological change and downsizing in the primary commodity industries of mining and forestry
however, the public service and trade sectors expanded during this same period, maintaining relative employment stability it is expected that increased employment in the service sector -- including the new information based jobs -- will offset further primary industry downsizing
hopefully, the success of the new technology based ventures will encourage others to take advantage of our competitive workforce and create additional employment
population movement figures from the latest census revealed that there has been very little migration into the region from elsewhere in canada, or from immigrants from foreign lands
the population of the city of sudbury has declined relative to the region as a whole we are the ninth largest city in ontario, and th largest in canada our population is aging, although not as quickly as other canadian cities twelve percent of our residents are over  years of age those over  and older outnumber those between  and 
this is a reversal of , when there were a far greater number of young people
the need for health care services for our aging population is obvious, and employment will increase in this sector
while we have fewer children in elementary and secondary school, it is expected that our post-secondary resources will be used to capacity with a greater percentage of young people acquiring higher education, and older workers upgrading their skills
as we move into the st century, we can predict, based on examining figures from the last  years, that regardless of past and future fundamental changes in our economic environment, we shall survive and perhaps prosper
all the ingredients are here -- and we can offer many advantages when compared to many communities, sudbury is a good place to invest
together, as citizens supporting and promoting our community, we can make it happen

92002 8745,Struggle to adapt,Aucun(e) disponible.,"re: 'a good day for canadian justice,' jan 
the shafia case is about more than violence and family violence
it is about more than religion or culture it is also about immigration and adaptation
i am an immigrant i came to canada with my parents i saw the struggle to adapt the cocooning that can take place the attempt to hold on to old ways
i saw the fear in my parents the fear of this foreign land and the near suffocating method they raised us with i saw the struggle of the -hour work day and the frustration that would be vented later on
we have an open immigration policy that results in older immigrants who may be less able to adapt in ethnic ghettos where nonwestern cultural norms are retained in cocooning with little social interaction, thus little embracing of western standards and western ways in many instances, the immigrants come from small villages these villages can be fantastically different than large western cities like montreal, ottawa, toronto, etc often, village life in the third world can lag the west by a significant amount
and so the immigrant does not simply travel a physical distance to come to canada, he travels through time as well this can lead to abuse, near suffocation and developmental lagging of immigrant children
in some instances, the child rebels within a relatively brief period, the child can move away from the parent who is struggling to adapt
the child can quickly embrace western cultures and norms, while the parent lives in fear once that happens, issues will arise
the shafia case was the extreme deal with immigration address issues of integration, adaptation and education

1889686297,Guaranteed income won't help women,Aucun(e) disponible.,"the basic income guarantee (big) as being framed in ontario today may well be a conversation-changer but in reality, it will change the conversation away from meeting the biggest demonstrated labour market and income equality challenge in canada right now - ensuring that canada's increasingly well-educated female, indigenous, racialized, refugee and immigrant populations have equal access to equal pay and affordable, flexible and accessible care resources
the original basic income experiment in manitoba demonstrated that the basic income payments encouraged more women with young children to take more time off paid work to provide unpaid care work it is well known that it is precisely women's long-term absence from paid work during lengthy parental leaves that exacerbates gendered pay and income gaps the only other labour market disincentive effect that manitoba's experiment had was to encourage young men to stay in their education programs longer thus, the manitoba experiment showed it actually increased gender-based economic inequalities at that time
why would ontario, with one of the highest levels of highly educated and motivated women in paid work, want to set up a program to undercut those women's chances of achieving economic gender equality in their lives?
especially because canada provides less child-care support than any of the other richest countries in the world (the oecd countries), it is urgent that large budgetary allotments, such as the $ billion the big experiment would apparently cost ontario, be devoted to meeting care needs in ontario, and to ensuring that all paid work in ontario is gender equal in all dimensions
if women are offered between  per cent and  per cent of a poverty-line income, no strings attached, it will make it all the more financially difficult for them to opt instead for paid work that involves high costs for care, high gender income gaps, and harsh levels of income and social security taxation
at  per cent to  per cent of poverty level incomes, the big would also place pressure on recipients to join the shadow economy to avoid large clawbacks of the big allowance it would reward all the wrong choices for a country that holds gender equality as a fundamental and core value canada as a nation already spends at least $ billion per year to subsidize the unpaid work of single and potential second-earner parents, a vast sum that could, if redirected, easily provide the funding for universal care programs in canada
comparative research makes it clear that countries that want to, and need to, take advantage of all the talents of all adults in their labour forces actively prioritize child-care funding to make sure paid work can pay for all adults, not just for those who can rely on women to provide the bulk of unpaid care work
an oecd study demonstrated that a second-earner parent earning two-thirds of the average ontario wage could expect to spend  per cent of their gross earnings on taxes plus child care (toronto, ), leaving just  per cent of their gross pay as """"take home"""" income net of all taxes, subsidies, and child care costs
the same study showed that single parents would only take home  per cent of their gross earnings after all taxes and care costs are taken into consideration the entire canadian and ontario tax/transfer systems are heavily weighted against enabling women to make paid work pay
if ontario wants to optimize the talents of its highly educated and motivated labour force, it will build out its social security system, provide meaningful paid work incentives for those who can move off of social security into decent paid work that can finance lifelong economic security, and establish better income safety nets for those facing unemployment, disability and unexpected economic crises
and it will also increase its contributions to post-secondary education so it does not continue to disincentivize those who have to mortgage their futures to student loans in order to someday earn an economically secure wage
given the importance of increasing the productivity of all members of canadian society, the big will clearly make it even harder for paid work to pay for any adult who is singled out by tradition, finances, family resources or workplace discrimination to be the family caregiver

""""we have a charter today because the people of canada wanted one canadians were ready for a charter they were ready to be bold it is as simple as that the genius of mr trudeau was in sensing this desire among our people and seizing the moment""""
chrtien, who declined interviews in advance of the anniversary, told the students debates leading to its adoption were """"fantastic,"""" full of drama and deep divisions
those divisions linger still
during a raucous question period, bloc qubcois mps and leader gilles duceppe denounced the """"sad anniversary"""" of the unilateral federal action in  that """"patriated"""" constitutional decision- making powers from britain, and put them in the hands of canada parliament and courts over the objections of quebec
chrtien replied that, as a francophone quebecer, he was """"very proud that we are no longer a judicial colony of great britain""""
yesterday, too, in quebec, the separatist parti qubcois government published a full-page advertisement in a leading newspaper to highlight quebec refusal to sign the  pact
the ad said seven quebec premiers of all parties refused to sign an accord """"that weakens the powers and rights of the only french- language parliament in the americas""""
so the quebec national assembly voted - in favour of a motion, restating the province position, that the constitution with its charter remains unacceptable
polls consistently show ordinary quebecers took the charter to heart and support its values
chrtien ignored protests, saying, """"the charter has become a settled part of our national life  canadians, in all provinces and territories, define their citizenship in terms much grander than their passport, their language or their region they define it in terms of the fundamental qualities and rights they possess as human beings rights that trump those of any government

standing next to a copy of the original rain-stained document, chrtien reminisced with reporters about how his own signature came to adorn the proclamation- even though protocol said it was to be signed only by the queen, the registrar-general (then andr ouellet) and the prime minister
""""as i was the minister of justice and i have done the work, mr trudeau asked me to sign there it was nice of him""""
chrtien signature is scrawled beneath the elegant handwriting of """"elizabeth r"""" at the top, with ouellet and trudeau at the bottom
asked what it means to him now, chrtien replied: """"you know, a lot of countries are copying this charter of rights and it was made by parliament  debating all the elements  a big fight and so on but we had a hell of a good document in the end""""
with many mps, senators and four supreme court of canada justices present, including chief justice beverley mclachlin and justice claire l'heureux-dub, chrtien joked about telling a foreign dignitary canada has so embraced equality rights that """"sometimes we have perhaps gone a bit far 
""""we have in the charter the equality of sex the governor- general she is an immigrant, you know a refugee, and now she the governor-general the chief justice, she a woman i said the country is run only by women: between the chief justice, the governor-general and my wife""""
off the cuff, chrtien recalled how """"i had to define what is the freedom of conscience  freedom of speech is easy, (as is) freedom of association but freedom of conscience, it was very difficult to define""""
critics say the charter is so broadly worded that freedoms and liberties are too open to judicial interpretation
canadian alliance leader stephen harper yesterday described an """"important and sad omission"""": it does not contain the """"right to property""""
tory leader joe clark called for inclusion of """"right to privacy and a right to property""""

1806995948,Challenges of capitalism should not fuel a Trump presidency; America's political meltdown is not the fault of neo-liberal policy,"[...]I think the economic, social and political effects are generally bad when, in whatever market, we privilege Canadian producers: consumers pay more, while capitalists and workers earn what economists call """"rents,"""" which means unearned incomes, and can climb the status and income ladders for reasons having more to do with political influence than ability.","  for decades now we've been familiar with the concept of liberal guilt successful people of generous temperament feel guilty about their place in the world they have succeeded, they think, because other people have failed they are rich because other people are poor ultimately, they don't believe they deserve their success it's in many ways a noble set of sentiments it rests on the truth that none of us knows what determines the exact path we take in life or where we end up luck influences all our outcomes, good and bad whether you make it all the way home depends on whether you started on first, second or third base liberal guilt also motivates a """"there but for the grace of god"""" inclination toward charity, even if in recent years many of us don't actually act out our charitable instincts, but instead hire bureaucrats to do it for us
but liberal guilt also flies in the face of the fact that many people who don't do well in life at least partly bring it on themselves it also, unhelpfully, tends to absolve people who aren't doing well of the responsibility to look to their own betterment, even if the odds they're up against aren't all their own fault others can always help, but buy-in from the person who wants to be improved is a necessary, if seldom sufficient, ingredient in self-improvement these days we're seeing a new version of liberal guilt: neo-liberal guilt neo-liberals - people who favour economic competition, more open borders and less intrusive domestic regulation - are being invited, and some even seem to be volunteering, to take responsibility for a global political meltdown whose most glaring manifestation is the success so far of donald trump's presidential candidacy
i certainly qualify as a neoliberal - though my world view, like most people's, is more complicated than a single adjective can encompass i supported the canada-us free trade agreement and nafta and i think the world trade organization, which works to open borders and then keep them open, is a good thing i favour competition in virtually all markets - columnwriting and university education, the two markets i compete in, certainly included and i think the economic, social and political effects are generally bad when, in whatever market, we privilege
canadian producers: consumers pay more, while capitalists and workers earn what economists call """"rents,"""" which means unearned incomes, and can climb the status and income ladders for reasons having more to do with political influence than ability
you want crony capitalism? go protectionist
on the other hand, i don't favour perfectly free immigration but who does? we could be less ruthless in offering landed immigrant status mainly to the best and the brightest citizens from poor countries, as determined by our cherry-picking point system (which, granted, was originally introduced to avoid racial discrimination, not enable talent plundering) but completely open borders? nobody of any consequence wants that
but despite holding these generally neo-liberal views, i decline to take responsibility for trump and his ilk yes, when enacted consistently (which is hardly anywhere, in fact) competition and openness can cause economic disruption, at least during a transition but all rich countries that have become more open in recent decades have generous social programs - yes, even the us fundamentally, the liberal internationalism the west has pursued since the second world war has been a very good thing do we really want to give the illiberal nationalism that preceded it another try?
in a capitalist economy, the only kind of economy capable of sustained innovation, economic disruption occurs daily we can and do cushion its blows but we should not let it excuse an ill-tempered, ill-spirited, ill-informed and ill-prepared candidate for president who consistently breaks civilized norms of decency and manners people have to be responsible for their vote
if you decide to blow the place up, that's on you, not me

our board follows the philosophy of ``inclusion'' this means our children with special needs attend regular classes with their peers, in their own neighborhood schools in order for this program to be successful, certain supports, such as resource teachers, pupil assistants, speech therapists and occupational therapists, must be in place

alberta's situation could work well here
i just watched the cbc evening news this was regarding premier ralph klein and his provincial budget, now announcing that they have actually come up with a healthy money surplus now, the surplus phase would be allocating the money back to programs that were cut at budget time and deciding who would be the people to set the priorities
this could be very interesting i know that it's wishful thinking and maybe dumb, premature dreaming on my part, but the same thing could happen here in the ontario budget in a couple of years but given all the negative publicity on mike harris and his crew, i have very shaky faith and lack trusting about what they would do, given the same outcome
this could produce an even greater problem with the pc majority government, showing their really true colors the already rich get richer and the poorer and middle class become history

newfoundland rich in customs and history
regarding the dec  column, the rock got me, hook, line and sinker, by the star's paul mckeague
the rock is more than a blob of land surrounded by whales and sundry fish, albeit not many cod newfoundland is very historic, the cradle, of white civilization in north america
the vikings landed in  ad it is the first of britain's overseas colonies john cabot discovered the island in  and took possession in the name of his sovereign, king henry vii in , sir humphrey gilbert reaffirmed this right of british ownership when he claimed the island in the name of queen elizabeth i and set up the first colonial government of britain overseas
in , the great eastern, wonder ship of her day, landed at hearts content the first successful atlantic cable at cabot tower on signal hill in st john's, marconi received the first wireless signals from across the atlantic on dec ,  the intrepid airmen alcock and brown left st john's for the first non-stop flight from north america to europe, june , 
the language spoken is the english speech, as it was pronounced in devonshire in the time of shakespeare you can also hear the rolling accent of cork or the rich burr of a kerry brogue from irish immigrants
st john's is the capital it had been captured by the french in  and  but eventually returned to the british the city has fine gothic architecture, the anglican cathedral and the roman catholic basilica there are good schools, hospitals, an excellent university and a government house students from all over the world attend the university
to a tourist, it is an interesting place to visit and one can be assured of great hospitality

industrial hemp editorial pro vided food for thought
i am writing to applaud the star on its editorial position regarding industrial hemp
it is surprising to read of the touted versatility of the hemp plant, which causes me to wonder why business and government have not taken steps to encourage the growing and processing of such a high-yield, low-maintenance plant according to the article, there are over , uses for the hemp plant and no opportunity for abuse what more could we ask for?
while browsing through the hemp story, i noticed that the quality of hemp products is quite high and in reading some of their information, it appears obvious that this could be the ingredient for canada to make its mark in the textile industry
just think of it, farmers who have been struggling can now plant a crop that does not require any herbicide, fungicide or pesticides, which are responsible for much of our water-born pollution concerns you can eat this stuff, cook with it, lubricate your engine, clothe the family, build your home, produce high-quality paper and much, much more
if our paper producers are wise enough to embrace this product, it can have a beneficial effect on the environment by saving our pollution-cleaning, oxygen-giving trees and substantially reduce the need for chlorine (which has a devastating effect on the ozone layer), as well as avoiding the discharge from the process into our water system
it appears to me that we will see some resistance, as the paper industry will have to make changes in their process, the chemical industry would sell fewer chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, along with a number of others who would have to adapt also, there will be a reduction of jobs in these areas but if industry and government work with farmers, this will be offset by the many more jobs created, and as an added bonus, our environment will be much cleaner
i agree with the star what are we waiting for?

coroner's jury was just an act of futility
i am writing in response to the comments in the paper regarding the statement that a coroner's jury made  recommendations to reduce the chance of deadly police chases four months before the horrific deaths of anthony and ruth anne simone
i served on a coroner's jury a few years ago and was shocked to discover that after all of the hard work that went into deliberating and making suggestions to avert a similar fatal tragedy, it all amounted to just that -- suggestions
no one was legally bound to follow up on any of the well-presented points at which we arrived to me, it was an exercise in futility all of those on the jury truly cared about the matter at hand
is this still the case? i pray that the system has taken a step forward and will act immediately on safer practices for the public and the police my heart goes out to the simone family

those wanting to separate can emigrate from canada
let me start by saying that i bear no malice could our federal government pass a law making the act of instigating separation an act of treason?
we have laws against hate literature, and if someone ``hates'' canada badly enough to want to separate, and talks of it in a crowd or prints literature to this effect, they could be punished
our members of parliament could agree on a referendum on any part or province wishing to separate, then hold a referendum for all of canada, requiring a two-thirds majority to win
what was sad in the last referendum was that approximately  per cent of the people who voted lost their vote but if they had won, then sadly, maybe  per cent of the people who want to stay in quebec as part of canada would have had separation rammed down their throat
i feel that the part of canada's land which is called quebec is canadian soil and if the people that are living on this land are not happy living in the best country in the world, then we would not prevent them from emigrating to another country
i am so proud to have been born in canada; so proud to be a canadian, knowing it is not perfect, but also knowing that we can help to make it even better

parents, not taxpapers, should provide breakfast
i totally disagree with mpp sandra pupatello's suggestion for a breakfast program for the schools it is just another way we, the taxpayers, would be made to take on a responsibility that should be met by individuals
people have to be taught to be responsible for themselves and any children they bring into this world by encouraging another handout, we are condoning the current thinking of so many of these people that ``the government will take care of me'' instead, we should be educating people to the fact that handouts are a way of the past, but as long as some politicians keep promising more and more giveaways, they will not learn
these children are going to school hungry because of two reasons -- the mother or father (if he is in the picture) is too lazy to make something for them, or the children don't want to have breakfast and the parents can't be bothered to discipline them properly, and it is another case of letting them do as they please it is easier and hassle-free
people have to learn that in this day and age, when it is so easy to prevent getting pregnant, that if they choose to do so, it is a great responsibility in many, many ways and they will be forced to accept these responsibilities
people like ms pupatello suggesting another handout not only will feed the children but continue to feed the thought that people don't have to take care of themselves, big brother will
i am tired of politicians, teachers or special-interest groups using the threat that ``the children will suffer'' if they don't get their way
this is just a form of blackmail or fear-mongering

parents must teach kids traffic safety
i would like to comment on a letter entitled, small price to payfor the safety of children, jan 
there have been many suggestions made about how to ensure the safety of children who need to cross roads to board their buses lots of suggestions
whatever happened to the most obvious solutions? aren't kids taught to look both ways before crossing any street? the life you save could be your own
even as a driver of a car, just because the light turns green, should you just go? better not, if you're on huron line how long does it take to look?
the young people today come out of the house at the last minute they have their walkman radio plugged into their ears
they couldn't hear a horn, no matter how loud they are oblivious to what's going on around them
they know that when the bus is stopped, cars in both directions have to stop that's the law but with all the traffic fatalities happening today, due to sheer neglect, isn't it worth stopping to look both ways before crossing?
light poles at driveways where kids are being picked up is not the answer more police on the road is not the answer, either
let's teach the children what we learned as children stop, look and listen, before crossing any street
teach them early that we all have to be responsible, whether walking or driving a car later on in life

re: (forum pushes for local think tank -- april )
the concept of a think tank, as proposed by the new way initiative, is an over-used idea with little merit the only things a think tank can facilitate are pockets of wealth and success, which benefit only a minority of people with the right social connections
i am especially disturbed at the repeated comments debunking the political process by dick destefano and by the media citizens of sudbury deserve more than stone throwing by a small group of libertarians who seek to denigrate the legitimate political process this country was built on
social democracy and the labour movement heavily influenced the canadian political experience universal health care and affordable education, as well as decent wages and working conditions are the result of political action, not think tanks
in early , i participated in the working together: building community wellness conference, sponsored by the sudbury immigrant integration group topics of this conference included healthy child development, recreating neighbourhoods; lifelong learning, community economic development, workplace wellness, housing, healthy aging, safe communities and food security
you see, the new way initiative is faulted because it assumes the only way to success relies on a strictly micro-managed, economic and apolitical model

the cause of an under-populated canada is not abortion the causes are more like a near -million-square-kilometre country that is cold for much of the year, women's lack of need to have more offspring and too little immigration
outlawing women's fundamental right to abort unwanted pregnancies is not a better solution than immigration to increase our population reproductive rights are the basis of every woman's autonomy

in a report released thursday the cmhc said canada needed  million more residences to be built by  in addition to the already  million homes projected to be constructed by that date to return affordability to the market
""""even if we had all the zoned land and services to allow everyone in this area to double their output next year, we don't have the trades and the people to do so,"""" said klundert, who is also vice-president of bk cornerstone design/build ltd
""""we're in such a shortfall position, i don't know if that deficit can be made up unless something changes on the labour end of things""""
klundert said last year in windsor and essex county there were starts on about , residential builds, which also includes condos and apartments that represented an increase of about one-third over 
""""that was our (industry's) best year locally,"""" klundert said """"right now, everyone is running fairly close to capacity
""""we're pulling trades from london, which is also booming, and people are moving back to the area because it's so busy""""
western university economist and senior director at the smart prosperity institute mike moffatt said it was also a near record-year for home construction in ontario however, it was nowhere near the pace of construction required to meet the cmhc's goals
""""in  about , homes were built in ontario,"""" moffatt said """"that's much higher than we have built in the past
""""between  and  we built about , per year we'd have to build , homes per year (to meet the cmhc target)
""""that's not going to happen
that shows how far off we are to returning to the affordability levels of  years ago""""
ontario is forecasting construction of , homes over the next nine or  years to reach the  targets in the study, another  million residences would need to be built
moffatt said ontario had been doing a reasonable job of balancing home supply with population growth until  when several factors began to distort the picture
the oil crash in alberta caused many people to return to the province, the federal government boosted immigration numbers, the number of those immigrants choosing ontario as home increased and there's been a significant growth in the number of international students attending the province's post-secondary institutions
rising housing costs in large urban centres led to families moving farther away and the covid- pandemic accelerated that exodus driving up prices across the province
""""we had a massive boom of  and -somethings coming to ontario, but we didn't change our planning processes or increase the number of homes we were building,"""" moffat said
klundert said the solution to increasing housing begins with reducing regulatory red tape, having the municipal staff to handle the planning process and addressing the trades shortage
he added covid- has also created supply chain issues, but that is expected to be a short-term problem
""""the red tape has filtered through all aspects of the building cycle,"""" klundert said """"it's resulted in a low inventory of residentially zoned land across ontario""""
he added one of his firm's parcels of residentially zoned land has taken over  years to get developed while his father ben, who founded bk cornerstone, is involved in a project approval process that has surpassed the -year mark
""""that's really how we got into this mess,"""" klundert said """"we've focused too much on quelling demand and not enough on the supply side""""
moffatt said the scale of the problem will force governments to make other significant policy changes
changes such as encouraging more dense development in urban areas, tying development to transit systems, innovation to speed up building processes and reduce the need for more labour
""""it can't be business as usual,"""" moffatt said
""""there's a role for governments to play, particularly in social housing, assisted living and the regulatory process it's also important to address affordable housing needs not provided by for-profit builders""""
moffatt added there are significant societal consequences for failing to improve housing supply and affordability
ontario is already seeing evidence of that with more people leaving the province, a higher rate of homelessness, longer social housing waitlists and children living longer with their parents
for the first time in  years ontario had a negative net migration with quebec with home prices a lure the average price of a home in quebec in may was $, while in ontario it was $,
""""because they're remaining in their parents'home, people are waiting longer to get married and putting off having children,"""" moffatt said
""""the fertility rate in ontario has fallen below alberta families and that was never the case when they do buy a home, they're often house poor and can't save, invest and spend on other things

239753352,Monarch magic: Exhibit to explore spell of butterfly:   [Final Edition ],"High in the mountains of central Mexico, the magic struck Morag Hutcheson and Barry Peers. Suddenly a forest full of monarch butterflies -- tens of millions that turned the trees orange -- were shivering, shaking their wings to warm up. In Canada, they need plenty of milkweed plants to live -- both to lay their eggs and to eat as caterpillars. But the plant with the bitter white sap is officially a noxious weed in Ontario, something that the law says you must destroy anywhere on your property. The law appears to come from the fact that milkweed tastes terrible to grazing animals, and its presence can ruin a hay crop. Color Photo; Chris Mikula, Citizen; Winging it: Organizer Morag Hutcheson offers a perch to one of the stars of Museum of Natur Monarca exhibit","  high in the mountains of central mexico, the magic struck morag hutcheson and barry peers suddenly a forest full of monarch butterflies -- tens of millions that turned the trees orange -- were shivering, shaking their wings to warm up
""""it sounds like wind in the aspens, says hutcheson
""""like dry leaves in the fall, says peers """"it sends shivers up your spine
this magic is what they hope to show visitors to the $-million exhibit monarca , which opens june  at the museum of nature, which is sponsoring the exhibit like the popular creepy critters bug show, it blends photos and video with displays of live creatures
the show will have a small but constant supply of live butterflies, with many more plastic ones -- life-sized and made from computer scans of male and female monarchs (they had to be plastic; you can't have hundreds of dead butterflies pinned up in a show about conservation, can you?)
mystery in monarch story
the show will use videos, photographs and tapes in english, french and spanish to tell the story of the insects' growth from eggs to adults; it will describe their lives here, and trace their annual migrations
after a year in ottawa, the butterfly show will travel to other museums across north america for five years
there is a mystery at the heart of the monarch story the big question for monarch-lovers is still unanswered: how do these tiny creatures find their way from canada to mexico and back each year without a guide?
after all, the monarchs you will see this summer have no sane reason to be here at all their flight to and from mexico is an epic on a tiny scale -- a flutter of orange wings that covers , kilometres and crosses the gulf of mexico no other insect travels as far
this wonderful creature is torn between the need to sleep through the winter in mexico and the need to hunt out its food, the milkweed, far to the north
once in canada it has only a few weeks to live the whole life-cycle -- egg to caterpillar to chrysalis (cocoon) to butterfly -- takes five weeks in august the great-grandchildren of today butterfly will begin three months of migration to the same few hillsides that their ancestors left in the spring
none of the migrants will be old enough to have seen the mexican homes their families left four or five generations ago yet they will find  sites in the transvolcanic mountains of central mexico
""""their memory is completely genetic, says morag hutcheson
in mexico they will hang from tree branches in long, drooping clusters, living off their body fat until the warmth of march wakes them up and sends them north mating literally on the fly, they will lay eggs in the southern united states and die, leaving a new generation to reach canada
(that, at least, is the dominant theory, though some say the same butterfly comes all the way back to canada)
why have an exhibit? monarchs sum up nearly every conservation issue in a neat package, says peers
in canada, they need plenty of milkweed plants to live -- both to lay their eggs and to eat as caterpillars but the plant with the bitter white sap is officially a noxious weed in ontario, something that the law says you must destroy anywhere on your property the law appears to come from the fact that milkweed tastes terrible to grazing animals, and its presence can ruin a hay crop
in mexico, monarchs can live only in forests of a particular kind of fir tree, the oyamel fir, at an altitude of , metres
encroaching farms and logging threaten these forests, though rural people are now planting firs in the mountains under a plan funded jointly by mexico and canada

353363723,RESOLUTION ON HOMOSEXUALITY:   [Final Edition ],"The most contentious statement in the document affirms that all persons -- regardless of their sexual orientation -- are welcome to become full members of the church if they profess faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to him. All members are also eligible to be considered for ordered ministry. A confessional statement -- a key part of the document -- declares that church members have participated in a history of injustice and persecution against gay and lesbian persons and admits that they are still struggling to understand homosexuality. The document also states that it is inappropriate to ask a candidate for ordination about his or her sexual orientation. Even the United Church delegates who were dead-set against the ordination of homosexuals strove to address the issue in a civil, compassionate manner and on the rare occasion when they didn't, the court reacted negatively. When Rev. Morley Clarke, a London commissioner who was defeated in his bid for moderator, suggested that the homosexual community is solely to blame for the AIDS crisis, his comments drew loud groans of disapproval from many commissioners, a scene that never would have happened if Victoria was merely a case of [Morden] revisited. One of [Svend Robinson] staff -- Bill Siksay -- has been a crusader in the ordination issue. Siksay once applied for ordination in the Bay of Quinte conference but the conference passed a motion saying no openly gay or lesbian person could become a full candidate for ordination until the church had a national policy on the issue.","report from the nd general council
of the united church of canada
rev gale glover likes to think of the united church of canada as a small child learning to walk
""""when a baby first starts to walk, she hangs on to the furniture she unsure so she takes a couple steps and then grabs onto something for support finally she lets go and she walking on her own,"""" glover explains """"the church has taken those first few steps just like a baby learning to walk, eventually we will run but it will be a long time until we finally let go of the furniture""""
glover, a kingston resident, was one of  united church commissioners who met in victoria, british columbia, from aug  to august  to debate and set policy for the largest protestant denomination in canada the ordination of homosexuals dominated discussion during the nine-day meeting and those first few steps were taken only after many hours of tense, soul-searching debate
when all the tears had dried and all the votes were counted the united church of canada had approved a document that commissioners hoped everyone could live with it is a statement that seeks to please all factions in the church by recognizing traditional christian values, such as fidelity within marriage and chaste singleness, but also attempting to enfranchise gays and lesbians
the most contentious statement in the document affirms that all persons -- regardless of their sexual orientation -- are welcome to become full members of the church if they profess faith in jesus christ and obedience to him all members are also eligible to be considered for ordered ministry a confessional statement -- a key part of the document -- declares that church members have participated in a history of injustice and persecution against gay and lesbian persons and admits that they are still struggling to understand homosexuality the document also states that it is inappropriate to ask a candidate for ordination about his or her sexual orientation
four years ago, delegates who attended the th general council meeting in morden, manitoba defeated a motion that recommended """"that in and of itself sexual orientation should not be a factor determining membership in the order of ministry"""" the conservative wing of the church hoped for a similar victory this year at the very least, they wanted to force the church to define sexual orientation so that it did not include sexual activity
but several attempts to insist on celibacy for homosexuals in the ministry failed and the conservatives had to settle for a clause that declares that all christian people are called to a lifestyle which is patterned on obedience to jesus christ they successfully convinced commissioners to pass a section that says the controversial report -- toward a christian understanding of sexual orientation, lifestyles and ministry -- on which the final statement is based, does not reflect the present position of the church and ought to be considered only as a historic document
in the end, however, the document which was passed by a large majority reflected an openness and a startling mood shift many commissioners talked of justice and the need to be an inclusive, rather than an exclusive church for some delegates the change of heart happened right on campus at the university of victoria as they talked with gays and lesbians and realized this debate was about real people, men and women who sit next to them in the pews, whether they know it or not
glover was sitting in the campus cafeteria on the last day of the conference as she discussed the church decision it was yet another early morning and she was feeling emotionally drained all around her there were fellow commissioners, people on both sides of the issue who would soon head home to explain what happened in victoria
""""i feel really mixed in that we have made some progress towards helping people to deal with the issue in the churches and in the congregations, but at the same time there are people who are here who are refusing to accept the decision we came to they are going to be working, and are already working, to try and get that decision wiped out,"""" she said
commissioner john sparling from the hamilton conference has asked the church judicial committee to rule on the section concerning membership because he believes it violates the fundamental laws on which the church was founded
glover has fought for an inclusive church for many years and she is in full agreement with the victoria decision """"my hesitation is that i am sorry we couldn't have gone further, and yet, at the same time, we have come a long way
""""there was a massive shift that occurred during this council there were people who came in absolutely, diametrically opposed to the report and any implications it might bring but during the course of this meeting, those people came to a point where they could vote in favor of the report we came up with,"""" she says
the shift in attitude was certainly evident to anyone who attended the general council meeting in morden four years ago
when commissioners addressed the issue in  they spoke of homosexuals as if they didn't really exist in the same room there were hurtful words and sometimes a tangible vehemence the few members of the gay and lesbian community who attended that meeting were shocked and pained by the lack of compassion
this year, however, the hateful statements, spawned from ignorance or fear, came from outside the church in one instance, members of the free presbyterians blitzed the conference handing out pamphlets entitled sodomy -- a gift from god or a perversion of man? they were asked to leave but continued to preach their message on the floor of council, commissioners agreed to allow two members of affirm -- gays and lesbians within the united church -- to address the meeting in , delegates refused to let members of affirm speak on the issue
even the united church delegates who were dead-set against the ordination of homosexuals strove to address the issue in a civil, compassionate manner and on the rare occasion when they didn't, the court reacted negatively when rev morley clarke, a london commissioner who was defeated in his bid for moderator, suggested that the homosexual community is solely to blame for the aids crisis, his comments drew loud groans of disapproval from many commissioners, a scene that never would have happened if victoria was merely a case of morden revisited
so what happened in the last four years that led to such a dramatic change in attitude?
rev james beal, a member of the church committee that drafted the statement in response to the report, feels that morden """"was more a head debate and this was a heart debate"""" beal, a resident of kingston, says that the most significant word in the statement is """"welcome""""
""""the willingness of the gay and lesbian church members to hang in, their ability to express themselves and also the alienation they were feeling, we had to move to bridge that gap,"""" he said """"there a spirit moving to be inclusive of gay and lesbian persons it was time we said welcome""""
the committee studied close to , petitions before reporting back to commissioners it worked on a consensus model rather than a majority vote system and members represented every conceivable position on the issue beal said it was difficult to discuss the report without a lot of tears and when the final position was reached he felt a sense of """"quiet confidence"""" more than exuberance
""""i think we are going in the right direction the church needs to be open to people and faith can be expressed in a number of ways i think people outside the church often see it as a guardian of public morality from inside the church, i would resist that interpretation i think we just feel that there are a lot of issues and concerns that come up that need to have a faith statement made about them,"""" beal said
moderator rev sang chul lee feels that people, like himself, who never talked about the issue before morden, finally met face to face with homosexual persons and realized that they are deeply committed christians who want to be a part of the church
lee election was a reflection of the growing maturity of the church born in siberia as the son of korean immigrants, the new moderator says he didn't think the membership was ready for him but he let friends persuade him to seek election
""""let be honest i had doubt whether they were ready to have an ethnic person as their moderator the traditional church has been very strongly waspish church,"""" he said lee feels the church is continuing to mature, especially on the homosexual issue four years ago, in morden, lee admits that he was """"a stranger"""" with the issue """"even now, i am not really expert on this issue because in my culture this kind of thing never comes up it is always suppressed, totally suppressed""""
lee strongly believes that the victoria statement is an honest, sincere attempt to address the issue """"i really don't expect anybody will say i am  per cent happy, no way, because the issue itself is not that kind of issue so we have to struggle together i love to struggle that the way we can grow
""""we are looking at human problems in the name of god organization is important, but, if that organization has no sensitivity for human pains and sufferings, what so good about that organization? we should just destroy that kind of organization,"""" lee told a whig-standard reporter on the final day of the conference
throughout the debate in victoria, lee and commissioners heard first-hand the stories of pain and suffering experienced by homosexuals as they fight for human rights in one section of the statement, the church calls upon all levels of canadian government to guarantee that the human rights of gays and lesbians are fully protected by law the church also calls upon its members to become active in the fight to protect those human rights
burnaby mp svend robinson says that the united church has added """"a welcome voice"""" to those people who have been calling on the federal government to live up to a promise made in march of  when minister of justice john crosbie said the tories would take all steps necessary to prohibit discrimination against homosexuals """"that was two and a half years ago and we are still waiting for action on that promise,"""" robinson said
robinson, who declared his homosexual orientation last spring, is not a member of the united church, although he once sang in an united church choir but he has followed the issue closely, attending the british columbia conference meeting and also visiting the general council meeting on the night that former moderator anne squire delivered her farewell address
one of robinson staff -- bill siksay -- has been a crusader in the ordination issue siksay once applied for ordination in the bay of quinte conference but the conference passed a motion saying no openly gay or lesbian person could become a full candidate for ordination until the church had a national policy on the issue
robinson said that siksay has suffered through frustration and pain but also joy during the many years of debate within the church the deciding factor in victoria, robinson said, may have been the opportunity delegates had to come face to face with homosexual persons
although the new democrat is not overly optimistic that the government will react to the united church statement he said that the church has greater credibility in its call for government action because it has tried to eliminate discrimination within its own structure
""""the church has shown real leadership in this area to the extent that the church is shining a bit of a beacon for other groups,"""" he said
""""they weren't dealing in some abstract sense with gays and lesbians they were dealing with their brothers and sisters right there amongst them it much more difficult to say no to someone face than an abstract idea,"""" robinson said
marion best, the woman who many people praised for her ability to guide the committee through a stormy issue, says that she wanted to see something on human rights and she hoped commissioners would accept the clause dealing with inclusion of homosexuals as members of the church
having worked as an emergency room nurse in an intensive care unit, best drew on that experience to help her chair the committee """"the thing i learned in the emergency room is that there has to be a non-anxious compassionate presence""""
when the document was debated by the whole council, best was saddened by the many procedural pitfalls """"if there is one thing i feel deeply sad about here it was the number of men running around with those yellow cards, at procedural microphones what we needed was to do the theology, not get bogged down in procedure""""
although tim stevenson -- a self-declared homosexual commissioner from british columbia -- made a tearful plea for delegates to pass the statement unanimously, best says she felt relieved that it was not an unanimous decision """"there no way that that would have been a true representation of what in the court let alone what in the whole church,"""" she said """"i think that there is hope for us as a church and that doesn't mean everybody is going to stay and everybody is going to think this is a wonderful document, but i believe we are going to be committed, most of us, to staying together and to continue to travel""""
the toughest journey for many commissioners was still before them as they returned to their homes across canada last week people who had come to the conference adamantly opposed to any resolution that supported homosexual ordination and had undergone a change of heart now had to return home and explain that awakening
the position adopted by the church will come as a shock and a surprise to thousands of united church members they will wonder why the commissioners appeared to ignore the hundreds of petitions calling for rejection of the key clause and why they are returning home with such an ambiguous document
commissioners who had the advantage of studying the issue in a compact community will have a hard time explaining the decision to the , church members across the land the people in their congregations won't have the advantage of meeting with homosexuals or hearing them speak to the issue as usual, the people directly affected by the decision will remain silent for the most part because it is still too traumatic for many of them to declare their sexual orientation
kevin guthrie, a kingston commissioner who supported the final document, says that it will be a test of faith to see how people react to his vote
""""the way i have voted i am going to alienate myself from a lot of people that i love their interpretation of scripture says something differently from a lot of us, from me, and i'm going to have to deal with it when i get back and it going to have to be on an individual basis""""
guthrie, director of music at queen street united church, says he feels proud of the document that was hammered out on the floor of the conference, although it has been criticized for its ambiguity
""""it needs to be ambiguous so that we can work with it we said all persons are eligible to be considered for ordination and the key word is eligible that not saying that anyone who comes is going to be ordained we went on to say that congregations, presbyteries and conferences are the deciding bodies they decide if a lifestyle is acceptable""""
rev gordon merkley, of princess street united church, found the nine-day ordeal disturbing and troublesome
before he left kingston, merkley stated that he could not support the ordination of homosexuals when he knew his congregation was solidly against it
""""i declared my position before i came and i think i was honest i do feel there are some who have talked about being open who really had their minds made up the only thing i can say to the people back home is that as far as i am concerned i tried and i was one of the ones who wasn't with the majority a few people talked in that way but i didn't really see them as being very numerous or really that set it may be that they felt it wouldn't really happen""""
merkley plans to talk with the board at his church and possibly arrange to have a special meeting of the congregation
""""this is a radical change in theology there are many people who feel uncomfortable because the church they grew up with is changing around them,"""" merkley said """"the hurt is deep so some people are going to have trouble how can you effect a reconciliation when you are still hurting yourself?""""
the bay of quinte conference is now faced with a review of its own policy on ordination the conference has had a motion on the books for some time that it will not ordain a self-declared homosexual until a national policy is established
rev peter mckellar, executive-secretary of the conference, says they will have to review that motion and see if the statement passed by the general council has fulfilled the mandate of a national policy
the hamilton conference is also faced with a dilemma because it has a written policy that no self-declared practising homosexual will be ordained in that conference rev john shearman, president of the conference, says the resolution will be reviewed in light of the general council decision
mckellar feels that commissioners made a clear statement that the controversial report released in march is now """"a dead issue"""" that report had suggested that the church acknowledge that heterosexuals and homosexuals """"can engage in sexual behaviour within a committed relationship with the intention of permanence that is morally responsible""""
mckellar said he is pleased that the position approved by the church still leaves the ultimate power to offer membership or ordination at the local level
many commissioners who arrived in sunny victoria speaking of """"the report"""" left the idyllic city with a document they now called """"our report""""
""""i think the statement we have got is one that everyone can live with what we have here is a sense of direction,"""" mckellar said
rev howie mills, executive secretary of the general council, agrees he says that the local congregations -- , across canada - - have a great role to play now they are the ones who must take the council decision and live it out
general council has made it clear that homosexual persons are welcome in the united church of canada now it will be up to local congregations to extend that welcome

canadian citizens appear to take much pride in statements such as the two above, but they suggest two very important questions that should be answered one, what is canadian? two, if canada is the only multicultural country in the world, then what is multiculturalism?
when a canadian travels abroad, if asked about canada's culture, what does the canadian reply? should the reply be that canada does not have any particular culture, we are multicultural? does it mean that individual canadians could lay claim to a variety of cultures? it is quite possible that if it were canada that suffered the barbaric terrorist attacks, canadians would not be able to unite behind their government
quebec might say it has nothing to do with us, and the provinces, even the one that suffered the wrath of the terrorists, would be blaming ottawa we could also expect division along religious lines, and between the poor and the wealthy this would be partly the product of canada's brand of multiculturalism canadians, regardless of our ethnic backgrounds, must realize that there is a more important, though intangible, aspect of citizenship
it must mean more than, """"i pay my taxes, have rights and freedoms and deserve equal respect"""" it requires responsibility that transcends ethnicity and religion it should demand the embracing of the history, heritage and customs of the nation as a unifying force for strong national ties and a national culture it should mean being canadian canada's immigration policy is fine it is the nation's failure to promote a national purpose after immigration that is the problem

the challenges are different and so are the attitudes of those who
live in these different communities there is the issue of winning
over the local troops, as one of their own was not selected to
govern from the top rank
and the demographics are significantly different in greater sudbury
than they are in york region, where half the residents speak a first
language that is neither english nor french pederson recognized
that when he said """"there are programs i feel very proud of being
part of down there, but whatever we do here has to be built in

that's good to hear, because his emphasis on community policing
-which each police force seems to interpret in their own way -will

240010047,QUEBEC DECIDES: A history of failure:   [FINAL Edition ],"At best, all efforts to tinker with the Constitution have been seriously flawed. Intended to be a symbol of unity, the Constitution has instead exacerbated the divisive tendencies of the Canadian political order. Rather than bringing the country together, some say, it has pushed Quebec even farther down the road to secession. The ``doubtful victory'' was the agreement between Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the provincial premiers -- except Quebec's [Rene] Levesque -- on a formula to patriate Canada's Constitution and entrench in it a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Quebec refused to sign the constitutional agreement. And therein lay the seeds for another decade of constitutional struggle that led to the Meech Lake accord fiasco, the rejection of the Charlottetown agreement and, ultimately, a second referendum on Quebec separation.","at best, all efforts to tinker with the constitution have been seriously flawed intended to be a symbol of unity, the constitution has instead exacerbated the divisive tendencies of the canadian political order rather than bringing the country together, some say, it has pushed quebec even farther down the road to secession
``a constitution is not something manufactured;
it is the work of centuries''
-- gwf hegel, th-century german philosopher
rene levesque would never forget that morning
``it was the stab in the dark    the day of anger and shame we had been
betrayed, in secret, by men who hadn't hesitated to tear up their own signatures    all around the big conference table, except at our place, it was congratulations and hearty laughter, some even going so far as to toast this doubtful victory''
it was thursday, nov , , at the ottawa conference centre another day of yet another constitutional conference
the ``doubtful victory'' was the agreement between prime minister pierre trudeau and the provincial premiers -- except quebec's levesque -- on a formula to patriate canada's constitution and entrench in it a charter of rights and freedoms
quebec refused to sign the constitutional agreement and therein lay the seeds for another decade of constitutional struggle that led to the meech lake accord fiasco, the rejection of the charlottetown agreement and, ultimately, a second referendum on quebec separation
it wasn't supposed to be that way trudeau wanted the charter and the constitution to be artifacts of canadian unity, symbols to promote a pan-canadian identity
instead, as some scholars observe, the constitution act of  has exacerbated the divisive tendencies of the canadian political order, pushing quebec even farther down the road to secession
constitutions aren't supposed to do that, of course constitutions are as permanent an artifact as humans can make they are supposed to provide the principles on which citizens establish their political institutions
at the most fundamental level, constitutions are about power formal or informal, written or unwritten, they define the basic power relationships between the state and the citizens
countries occasionally tinker with their constitutions, altering them to reflect changing conditions but once constitutional traditions are established, few engage in the risky business of wholesale alteration
the reason is simple: to substantially rework a constitution is, in a sense, to reinvent the state to reinvent the state, says political scientist peter russell in constitutional odyssey, ``raises the fundamental question of whether citizens of a nation-state share enough in common, in terms of their sense of political justice and collective identity, to go on sharing citizenship under a common constitution''
in the past three decades, canada has frequently wandered where other nations fear to tread in the early s, john diefenbaker's government tried and failed to win provincial agreement to bring the constitution home to canada
again, in , lester pearson's government got all  provincial premiers to agree on a formula for patriation but the deal collapsed when quebec later withdrew its assent seven years later, in , came the victoria charter most provincial legislatures ratified it, but again the deal died when quebec's premier, robert bourassa, who had initially accepted it, caved in to political pressure at home
then, in , after the parti quebecois came to power, constitutional issues claimed top billing on the canadian political stage
to date, all efforts to rework the original constitution, the british north america act of , have failed or, at best, been seriously flawed
``an examination of the major constitutional initiatives of the past few decades reveals a striking pattern of negotiation followed by agreement followed by failure,'' says political scientist brooke jeffrey in strange bedfellows, trying times
some blame francophone quebecers: if only they'd accept their ``place'' in confederation; others suggest english canada's lack of maturity is to blame for canada's constitutional quagmire
political scientist russell, on the other hand, says canada's seemingly endless constitutional debate is rooted in canadians' historic inability to shape a collective identity they may have stuck together as a political state, but decades of dividing the country along a french-english faultline has militated against forming a canadian ``nation'' -- that is, a national identity shared by all citizens
this issue of a ``canadian'' national identity was not even considered by the fathers of confederation for them, the legitimacy of canada's constitution was founded on the sovereign parliament of the british empire
russell notes that this idea was reflected in a letter written in  by three of the fathers of confederation -- george-etienne cartier, alexander galt and john ross -- to the british colonial secretary, proposing a federal union of the british north american colonies
in their proposal they explicitly rejected the idea that canada's constitution should follow the us model and derive its authority from the people the basis of confederation, they wrote, ``does not profess to be derived from the people but would be the constitution provided by the imperial parliament   ''
for these mid-victorians, then, as russell comments, sovereignty, or political authority, ultimately rests with parliament political power flows down from the state and its institutions to the citizens
by the time of the meech lake accord in  the understanding of the relationship of power between the state and its citizens had changed considerably
this change is captured in a letter newfoundland premier clyde wells, an opponent of meech lake, wrote to two of the accord's supporters shortly before its collapse ``the constitution,'' wells wrote, ``belongs to the people of canada -- the ultimate source o
between these two statements, russell says, lies a different understanding of what legitimizes a constitution and the political -- or power -- relationships it establishes
the confederation-era constitution-makers saw canada as a political community, not a national community canada was hammered together from the fragments of britain's north american empire
this state, with its dominant french- and english-speaking nationalities, lacked a shared culture, a common history and even a mutual interest instead, the two language groups bound themselves together with a political system that tried to combine the centralizing tendencies of the british westminster system, with its allegiance to the idea of parliamentary supremacy and majority rule, and the decentralizing leanings of us federalism, with its system of checks and balances between different levels of government and institutions
the result has been a country that has stayed together politically not because canadians as a whole share some deep-seated national identity, but because various institutional arrangements and elite deal-making were able to cover over the religious, ethnic, linguistic or regional differences that occasionally threatened the state's political survival
in recent decades, though, there has been a shift away from traditional state-centred sovereignty to a society-centred view more akin to the us tradition
the key turning point in this transition was trudeau's insertion of the charter of rights and freedoms in the constitution act of 
``the constitution is no longer an affair of governments,'' says political scientist alan cairns in competing constitutional visions ``in addition to the governments' constitution, which tends to focus on federalism, there is a citizens' constitution, which the charter symbolizes''
in the post-charter era, then, the old system in which constitutional issues were matters of federal-provincial negotiations and elite accommodation -- or executive federalism, as it became known -- has lost status as the means for determining the relationships between the state and the citizens
whether this shift in power relations has helped to bind the country together is questionable, but this was certainly trudeau's hope
he thought the charter would counterbalance the decentralizing leanings of the provincial governments, particularly quebec's, by giving all citizens a symbolic and a practical expression of national identity independent of their regional loyalties
a key aspect to this nation-building effort was trudeau's insistence on the entrenchment of official bilingualism in the charter, along with minority language education rights these rights, in contrast to others in the charter, could not be subject to legislative override of either the federal or provincial governments
trudeau's insistence on including bilingualism in the charter reflected his notion of a bilingual canada as a counterweight to quebec nationalism bilingualism, according to trudeau, would mollify the tensions between the french and the english by establishing individual rights that were national in scope
in trudeau's view, the nationalism of quebec separatists would create two language ghettos in canada and, eventually, lead to canada's collapse
the charter was intended to resolve the two perennial issues of canadian politics: french-english relations, or the question of national unity; and the power struggles between the federal and provincial governments, between the forces of centralization and the forces of decentralization
to some degree the charter accomplishes its purpose it establishes a base of citizen rights and freedoms that cannot be undermined by provincial or federal legislation moreover, it encourages canadians to participate in constitutional matters by challenging government legislation in the courts
alan cairns believes this public participation helps unify the country because citizens will identify more closely with national institutions, thus weakening their regional loyalties as he states: ``if the charter takes root over time, the psyche of the citizenry will be progressively canadianized''
not all scholars are so sure
political scientist donald smiley, writing before the constitution's patriation, warned that a charter of rights was ``inherently a fragmenting rather than unifying measure'' the charter, he said, would set the idea of people defending their rights above the idea of people learning how to co-operate
relying on the courts to settle differing rights claims works against national unity because canadians will no longer seek to work out their differences through political action, which, for all its flaws, does require some political maturity
smiley suggests the implicit message of those who promote the charter's rights-based society is that legislatures, politicians and even the voters themselves -- indeed, the whole of the democratic process -- cannot be trusted to act wisely
many english-speaking canadians thought the forging of the november agreement that led to the constitution act of  reflected a ``historic compromise'' in the best canadian tradition, a deal that ended years of bitter constitutional debate and allowed canada to cut one of the last vestiges of its colonial past
for many quebecers, though, the lack of quebec's signature on the constitution meant the province was kept out of the constitutional family by the english-speaking majority and, many, including levesque at the time, claimed quebec was betrayed
the betrayers, in levesque's view, were easily identified first, there was trudeau on the evening of wednesday, nov , , the quebec premier had returned to his hotel in hull thinking he and the prime minister had an agreement in principle to hold a national referendum on repatriating the constitution
second, there were the premiers of seven of the provinces levesque assumed he and the other premiers remained united in their opposition to trudeau's plans to proceed unilaterally with patriation and other constitutional changes, including the entrenchment of the charter
the gang of eight, as the dissenting premiers were known, had agreed in april  to their own patriation formula: the constitution would be returned to canada with an all-canadian amendment procedure, but there would be no other constitutional changes, including a charter of rights, until after it was back in canada
under pressure to form a front against trudeau, levesque accepted this formula even though it lacked explicit recognition of quebec's historic claim to a constitutional veto
but six months later, at the november conference, seven premiers agreed to a deal with trudeau the agreement, later to be known as the ``kitchen accord,'' had been forged in a small, secluded room of the conference centre during a nighttime meeting between jean chretien, the federal justice minister, roy romanow and roy mcmurty, the attorneys general of saskatchewan and ontario
levesque claimed he'd been betrayed ``tricked by trudeau, dropped by the others,'' he wrote in his memoirs when he arrived at the chateau laurier for a breakfast meeting that thursday, he found a sheet of paper beside his plate informing him of the new deal he would refer to the deal as ``the night of the long knives''
quebec, he concluded, had been humiliated, left alone against the majority anglais and their federal system
levesque's judgment of the deal between trudeau and the premiers has been questioned some scholars point out that the day before trudeau and the premiers struck their arrangement, levesque himself split from the other premiers without their knowledge to endorse trudeau's offer, serious or not, to delay the imposition of the charter for two years and hold a national referendum on it
others suggest that following the defeat of the separatist side in the  quebec referendum, levesque was only a half-hearted participant in the constitutional process anyway
perhaps the quebec premier wanted some excuse to keep quebec outside the constitution, wanted, in other words, to reinforce quebec's historic grievances as peter russell observes: ``even though the parti quebecois had temporarily put independence on the back burner, it was hardly a credible partner in any project to reform the canadian constitution''
regardless of whose version of events is accepted, there is no doubt the charter exacerbated the differences between quebec and the rest of canada
after the november conference levesque returned to quebec city, where he denounced what had happened as ``the most despicable betrayal'' he warned that quebec's isolation would have ``incalculable consequences''
at the time, the warning seemed little more than the anger of an embittered man fighting a losing cause after all, by , when the parti quebecois was defeated in a provincial election by robert bourassa's resurgent liberals, separatism was judged dead and all but buried
but resuscitation of separatist sentiment wasn't long in coming
on dec , , the supreme court, newly empowered by the charter to rule on matters that had by and large been the preserve of parliament, declared that quebec's french-only sign law violated the charter, and, as russell remarks, ``all hell broke loose''
actually, it can be argued that the embers of separatism were fanned earlier in  when the supreme court ruled that another section of quebec's charter of the french language, bill , was unconstitutional
the quebec legislature had adopted bill  in , two years after the parti quebecois came to power the bill, the centrepiece of the parti quebecois's nationalist policy to preserve french language and culture, effectively made french the language in all areas of quebec life and work
in , however, the supreme court ruled that a section of bill  restricted english-language education in quebec this, according to the court, violated section  of the charter, which protects the language education rights of quebec's anglophone minority
despite its anger at the court decision and even though it wasn't a signatory to the constitution, the quebec government had to accept the court's decision since the language-education section of bill  fell outside the domain of the charter's ``notwithstanding clause'' -- section 
under section , which the provincial premiers insisted trudeau place in the charter as a condition to their agreeing to his patriation demands, parliament and the provincial legislatures can declare a law valid even if it offends other sections of the charter that deal with fundamental legal and equality rights
but section  of the charter, which deals with minority language rights, was, at trudeau's insistence, placed outside the purview of this override clause
thus, quebec could not use the ``notwithstanding clause'' to override the court's ruling against bill 's language-education section
however, the court really fanned the separatist embers when, three years later, it struck down the section of bill  that required that all signs, including commercial signs, be in french the court concluded the french-only sign law violated the charter's guarantee of freedom of expression
this time, though, the bourassa government, under intense pressure from francophone nationalists, responded with legislation invoking the ``notwithstanding clause'' of the charter, allowing the french-only sign law to remain in force the government could do this because the french-sign legislation was outside the scope of section  of the charter
while many in english canada had strenuously objected to bill , they were infuriated when quebec made use of the charter's override provisions to reinforce its language policies how dare quebec be so discriminating, so anti-democratic, so anti-english; never mind that english-speaking provinces had done much the same thing ever since the manitoba government banned french in schools in the late s
quebec's use of the ``notwithstanding clause'' has been blamed for contributing to english canada's rejection of the meech lake accord
``it is entirely possible that it (meech lake) would have been adopted had the quebec unilingual signs issue not suddenly flared up at the end of ,'' says russell, noting that by mid- the accord had been ratified by eight provincial legislatures and the house of commons
after bourassa invoked the ``notwithstanding clause,'' manitoba premier gary filmon withdrew the accord from his province's legislature, effectively ensuring its failure
amidst all the anti-quebec shouting, it was conveniently forgotten that quebec had only done what it was legally entitled to do; it had used section , the override provision of the charter that the other provinces had insisted on placing in the charter quebec's critics also seemed to forget that the ``notwithstanding clause'' had been added to the charter for the very reason quebec used it -- to retain the tradition of parliamentary sovereignty for those times when the courts interpret the constitution in a way that denies the will of those elected to represent the people's wishes
still, in the uproar, english-canadian anger was translated into a general hostility against efforts to obtain a constitutional reconciliation with quebec this hostility certainly contributed to the death of meech lake in , and, in all likelihood, the defeat of the charlottetown agreement in 
both english canada's fury over quebec's override action and the later constitutional debacles of meech and charlottetown betray the ironic consequences of the charter's having undermined the traditions of parliamentary sovereignty as russell remarks: ``that charter, trudeau's charter, designed to unify canada, had become a profound source of disunity''
this divisiveness was certainly a contributing factor in english canada's opposition to recognizing quebec as a distinct society in the meech lake accord
for many english-speaking canadians, the charter's emphasis on the equal rights of individual citizens had replaced the traditional constitutional concern with provincial rights
in their view, the distinct society clause would undermine the charter's guarantees of equal rights for all canadians
pointing to the french-only sign law, they argued that non-francophones in quebec would be deprived of their rights if quebec obtained constitutional recognition as a predominantly french-speaking society such an argument ignored quebec's own charter of rights, one of the most progressive in the country
for french-canadians, though, the idea of quebec as a distinct society is a historical reality today's francophones are the inheritors of a three-century-old culture, with its own language, traditions and institutions; a culture that refuses to be assimilated into the anglophone world
trudeau's charter may have won the loyalty of english-speaking canada, but a majority of francophones, if forced to choose between giving primacy to the charter and their collective survival as a francophone nation, would chose the latter as their fundamental constitutional value
for quebec, then, the constitution and charter were objectionable for several reasons
the amending formula removed quebec's traditional constitutional veto; the charter undermined the efforts of francophones to protect the french language and culture by implying that the idea of quebec as a distinct society promoted inequality and, thus, was incompatible with the charter's principle of the equality of all canadians; and, finally, the recognition of multiculturalism, with its essential notion of the equality of all cultures and cultural origins in canada, was a rejection of the francophone vision of canada as the creation of ``two founding peoples''
trudeau's pan-canadian ideology may have become the country's fundamental law in , but for many quebecers that vision betrayed their understanding of canada's founding spirit

i just saw the the italian catholic bishops' warning against catholics marrying muslims on grounds that there are vast cultural differences and that children of the marriages would shun christianity
religious directives such as these intensify inter-faith conflict between christians and muslims in mixed-race, interfaith and intercultural marriages, there is a clear need for accommodation and mutual acceptance of each other in a complete sense, which includes the respective religious bonds
as one who comes from a mixed-race and interfaith marriage (that is, east indian hindu and slovak christian), i have been privileged to be exposed to both faiths and to evolve as a hindu-christian in the hindu tradition, i was fully accepted for the mixed faith only recently, in my retirement years, progressive thinking by the catholic leadership allowed my mixed faith to be formally recognized by the catholic church
whether the mixed marriage is catholic or muslim, hindu or christian and others, sound spiritual recognition lies in mutual acceptance of each other's faiths there is not just one path in today's diverse canada, one must be prepared to face this mixed- faith marriage reality in the full spiritual sense this means that there must be no directives by religious institutions towards exclusion

It's not that Quebecers are afraid of strangers. It's just that they don't want anybody (yes, that includes English-speaking Canadians outside Quebec), to mess with their modele de societe. Which Quebecers are doing in being so upset here, as they also were when there was talk of instituting shariah law in Ontario. They really don't like anything that screams """"official special privileges for minorities"""" at them.

What you do in the privacy of your home or your church (or mosque or synagogue) is your business. But if you think you can force Quebecers to accept weapons, no matter how often they are described as symbolic, with a sheepish smile in public schools, you are grossly mistaken. In addition to all that, some Quebecers, especially the nationalist and separatist ones, worry about allowing the Rest of Canada to use federal institutions to dilute the """"French fact"""" in Quebec. In this case it's not so clear since the decision was unanimous and written by a francophone Quebec judge. But the sentiment is still there.","  it's always nice when people are consistent it's even better when they happen to be right so it is with great pleasure that, for once, i present to you the quebec reaction to the kirpan case and invite you to cheer it won't hurt, i promise and yes, you'll still be allowed to criticize the province for something else later in the meantime, here are my two thumbs up
much has been made of the immediate, overwhelming, and almost viscerally negative reaction from francophone quebecers to the supreme court ruling allowing orthodox sikhs to carry kirpans to public school on the same day the ruling was handed down, la presse and its sister papers across the province received some  e- mails, the vast majority of them negative
the reaction has been called unreasonable, xenophobic, even bordering on racist by some -- not all of whom express themselves in english, but let's just say the english-speaking press is where i've noticed the most strongly worded condemnations the few francophones who support the decision and criticize the reaction, such as le devoir's josee boileau, tend to do so gently, calling the reaction immature or badly thought through
i don't see anything xenophobic, never mind racist, in quebecers' overwhelmingly negative reaction it's not that quebecers are afraid of strangers it's just that they don't want anybody (yes, that includes english-speaking canadians outside quebec), to mess with their modele de societe
i have many a quarrel with the quebec model, but i do agree with the theoretically egalitarian and secular way it treats everybody, whoever they are and whatever they look like and i believe that if you're going to base some of your actions and attitudes on this model you should be consistent and base others on it too
which quebecers are doing in being so upset here, as they also were when there was talk of instituting shariah law in ontario they really don't like anything that screams """"official special privileges for minorities"""" at them quebecers are on the whole a fairly welcoming bunch, but only if by agreeing to settle in quebec you also agree to live by quebec's rules, which include speaking french in public and checking your dagger at the schoolhouse door what you do in the privacy of your home or your church (or mosque or synagogue) is your business but if you think you can force quebecers to accept weapons, no matter how often they are described as symbolic, with a sheepish smile in public schools, you are grossly mistaken

sure, some of the reactions were over the top others showed a crass misunderstanding of the case -- it's not true, for instance, that there is no restriction on how to wear a kirpan but hey, it's always like that in society: not everybody gets it right it doesn't mean the general reaction is not valid even if some who express it aren't as sophisticated as a globe and mail editorial and while it would be foolish to deny the presence of racist individuals in quebec or anywhere else, they are a pathetic minority usually best ignored who are not an important aspect of this reaction
unlike la presse's long-time columnist lysiane gagnon on saturday she wrote that the court's """"respect for religions is in the process of confining it to the absurd"""" she also wondered """"what's preventing doukhobors from demanding the right to go naked in public, or islamists the right to slaughter lambs on the street on eid, or hassidim that no cars be allowed in outremont's streets on friday after all, why not?""""
why not indeed?
it's not xenophobia, let alone racism it's a clear, widespread rejection of multiculturalism in favour of a quebecois version of the american melting pot as premier jean charest explained last spring when the national assembly passed a unanimous, bipartisan resolution opposing shariah in quebec and in canada, """"we are very much an inclusive society, but a society that will govern itself by one set of rules"""" those who don't like it are free to run for office and try changing the rules, or go live someplace else
there are things i dislike about the quebec model but i agree with quebecers' belief in one law for all, and admire their willingness to stand up for it without embarrassment

feminism is pamela milne religion
the university of windsor religious studies professor is a staunc h advocate of women rights - a member of the canadian abortion rights action league (caral), co-author of the university sexual harassment policy and a vocal thorn in the side of university officials slow to implement employment equity
her active quest to stomp out sexism earned her a nomination for woman of the year by caral and the women incentive centre
she won the award for her promotion of feminism ask her what feminism means and you're liable to get an answer so broad it obvious she has given it lots of thought
""""there is no one definition this is something i teach my students in the first lecture   it everything from a philosophy to a political movement""""
milne wants women to achieve """"full equality in every sphere""""
she not naive she realizes it is easier said than done
""""it means a recreation of society, a revisioning of society""""
the place to start is education
""""when they go out into society and do these very imporant jobs that structure society, they depend on the base they've had through their university education"""" the gender-imbalance in the university environment """"perpetuates the imbalance in the real world""""
sexism stems from this imbalance and """"allowing"""" women to take positions of leadership and authority is the only remedy, says milne
""""for me, everything revolves around employment equity   if we get equitable representation these other things will not be problems""""
milne efforts to support the new female faculty members include last year helping set up """"a buddy system"""" for other women to turn to when times get tough
milne is a staunch advocate of affirmative action charges of reverse discrimination don't hold water, says milne
""""i have no sympathy for the reverse discrimination standpoint   where were these people when there was discrimination in favor of men?""""
the university sexual harassment policy, she says, is """"a non-effectively functioning policy"""" and while there are women on the faculty, there are not enough
change is slow - """"one step forward, three steps back,"""" she ys
but she is not without hope
""""i'm happy to have done my part   and i hope that i do make it easier for the women who come after me""""
she hopes to spur on inevitable
susan zanin has a vision
""""i'm sure one day it will happen in our schools - an equal partnership of men and women""""
it the vice-principal of shawnee secondary school goal that education be the means of fostering equality and feminist ideals
she sums up those ideals this way: """"i think it pride in being a woman, being capable and confident, being an equal and competent colleague of men""""
zanin has tried in her  years as an educator to make those ideals rep lace the """"negative connotation"""" given to the word """"feminism""""
she helped establish the provincial and local status of women committees under the ontario secondary school teachers' federation before taking the post as vice-principal at shawnee, she worked as the affirmative action resource teacher for the windsor board of education
she has helped develop a sexual harassment policy for the board, set up student programs on family violence and has run workshops for teachers on how not to perpetuate sexism in the classroom
apart from teaching students about non-traditional occupations, teachers can change their language - not use """"he"""" for """"her or she,"""" or """"mankind"""" for """"humanity"""" - and not subconsiously treat male students diffently than female students
teachers tend to expend their energy disciplining boys, she says, giving them the """"very subtle advantage of learning how to interact with authority at an earlier age"""" the attention girls receive is praise for neatness or having things done for them when a problem occurs
zanin knows the research, the theory behind it she has used it to set up a curriculum for teachers and students - one step in the """"growing awareness of how to develop an equal society""""
her work on women issues aside, zanin was nominated for the woman of the year award by the teachers' federation status of women committee for being a role model for teachers and women in general a former federation president and union negotiator, zanin has broken the barriers to traditional male roles
she says she is happy to see she is not alone, but frustrated by the fact that there aren't more women around her
women penetrating the upper echelons of school administration is an inevitable change, she says with as much determination in her voice as hope

in the most eagerly awaited speech next to that of nominee bob dole acceptance address thursday, the only black to rise to the pinnacle of the us military establishment broke from the tightly scripted nature of the convention by tackling the abortion issue, which still has the capacity to divide the party
but powell said that is why he became a republican, because the party is big enough to have invited him to give the keynote speech at the opening of the convention even though he believed in """"a woman right to choose"""" and affirmative action in hiring for minorities
""""let us never step back from compassion,"""" he said """"the message we must convey to the american people is that we fight for welfare reform, we fight for health-care reform and other reforms not just to save money, but because we believe there are better ways to help americans in need""""
at times, powell appeared to be lecturing the delegates, telling them that they must accept the """"hispanic immigrant who became a citizen yesterday"""" and the descendants of slaves the same way they accept the """"mayflower descendent"""" he received several standing ovations
earlier in the day, republicans adopted a party platform of principles that should provide president bill clinton plenty of ammunition to continue tarring them with the """"extremist"""" label he has used effectively the past two years
the official blueprint under which nominee dole ostensibly must shape his fall campaign included strong language against immigration, abortion and a protectionist pledge to """"carefully monitor the north america free-trade agreement"""" to ensure the us does not lose ground to canada and mexico on the trade front
""""with canada, [clinton] tolerates discrimination against the united states beverage industry and focused on our lumber crisis too late to help closed logging mills,"""" the platform reads, referring to two long-standing trade complaints under a dole administration, the platform said, the us will deploy its super  legislation - that allows unilateral imposition of tariffs - against countries like canada, mexico, china and japan
the platform also calls for a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion even if carrying a fetus to term endangers a mother life, curtail immigration, make flag-burning illegal, end affirmative action programs and eliminate the departments of energy, education and housing
dole was quick to dismiss the importance of the party platform, saying he had not read all the items on the platform and did not agree with all the provisions he agrees, however, with the party platform calling for aggressive measures against so-called """"unfair"""" trading nations

2725526429,A crisis in the ranks,Aucun(e) disponible.,"there's trouble in the ranks of canada's military, as in much depleted ranks there are too few personnel to safeguard the country for the dangerous times ahead, according to gen wayne eyre, the chief of defence staff
it's gotten so bad that earlier this month, the top general ordered that recruitment and retention be made a top priority to fill a shortage of , personnel he's now calling for a """"whole-of-society effort"""" to help rebuild the forces
""""and we've got to do it with a sense of urgency and priority because it is affecting our ability to respond around the world,"""" eyre told the canadian press in a recent interview
a short-staffed military impedes its ability to deploy abroad and respond here at home, to natural disasters as personnel recently did to assist in the aftermath of hurricane fiona that has serious implications for the security of the country and its ability to join allies to exert influence, especially given the ongoing tensions with russia
yet if commanders are wondering why recruiting efforts are falling short, they need only look in the mirror in many ways, this is a crisis of the military's own making it has not done enough to transform its ranks and culture to make itself an attractive employer of choice
largely white and male, the armed forces itself concedes that a lack of inclusion hinders retention and recruitment its efforts to stamp out sexual harassment, misconduct and abuse have also fallen short
let's recall the words of former supreme court justice louise arbour in a report released just last may, she painted a picture of an insular institution stuck in the past, out of step with """"values and expectations of a pluralistic canadian society""""
she cited an """"archaic and deeply damaging organizational culture"""" that has its roots in an abuse of power, antiquated practices and """"the glorification of masculinity as the only acceptable operational standard""""

further west toward toronto, more than , whimbrels were counted as they migrated west along the lake front
over the next week, more migrant shorebirds will pass over our region and most will not stop unless inclement weather grounds them
on may , a purple sandpiper was found at the end of britannia pier by louis sobol this arctic shorebird is a very rare spring migrant there are only a few late-may, early-june records of this bird for the ottawa-gatineau district
brant continue to be reported from the area, with flocks of  at constance bay and  over rockcliffe parkway on may , while  over lake deschenes,  over carleton place and  resting on the ottawa river were observed on may

the service teaches children language and culture outside school hours, with the ministry of education picking up the tab as soon as there are at least  students for a language class
any language other than french and english is considered a heritage language
before the unveiling of the  budget, $, from secretary of state gerry weiner that helped provide heritage language training for , students throughout ottawa-carleton had been criticized as a mere drop in the bucket toward preserving canada cultural diversity

for example, leira molavi, director of the persian heritage language school, says her high school class may have to be scrapped unless she can find enough students to meet the province -to-one pupil-to-teacher ratio the federal money, $, for her school in , gave her the freedom to hire an extra teacher

game says heritage language school directors, with whom she meets once a month, are confident weiner will reconsider the cutbacks
""""they say they will write letters and circulate petitions until they win""""
but a spokesman for the department of the secretary of state doesn't hold out much hope
""""i'm not aware of any move toward reinstating that funding,"""" said marion brown, the department director general of communications
ottawa west mp marlene catterall says her office has started its own letter-writing and petition on behalf of the cause
""""we feel that heritage language schools are helping to neutralize language and racial problems in the country and we want to see them protected""""
catterall especially objects to a government plan to establish a national heritage language institute in the wake of the schools' cutbacks
""""the government is cutting off the roots of the plant and putting a plastic flower in its place,"""" she said
before the house of commons is proposed legislation that would see the establishment of the canadian heritage languages institute its mandate would be """"to ensure the preservation and use of heritage language in canada,"""" said brown
she said that while the institute would not offer classes to students, it would train heritage language teachers, develop language programs and develop learning materials for heritage language schools
the institute would receive $, a year for five years and another $, for five years to be placed in an endowment fund, said brown

2774227812,Let us have only one class of citizens,Aucun(e) disponible.,"re: christian leuprecht's column """"the dilemma of dual
citizenship"""" (july )
the death of an israeli helicopter pilot, a canadian dual citizen,
shows the dilemma leuprecht points out: should we discriminate
between canadian citizens born to the citizenship and those who
acquire it?
for a long time, australia didn't allow dual citizenship like
canada, australia has had considerable immigration in the last half-
century
how can a country enforce this? with some countries, if you were
born a citizen you are always a citizen australia, i believe,
realized this and allowed immigrants to retain their original
citizenship what australia could easily control were those born-in-
australia citizens who lived in another country and took
citizenship there in recent years, this was accepted as
discrimination, and now australians can carry dual citizenship
i am a dual citizen, having been born and educated in the united
states although the us tries to keep its citizens thinking they
can't have dual citizenship, citizens who went to israel were
allowed to keep american citizenship as i understand it, even the
prohibition against serving in the government or military of
another country was ignored
eventually this was challenged the courts said that only the
courts could remove us citizenship for someone taking the
citizenship of another country, and then for only two reasons: the
person has asked for citizenship to be removed; or for treason
let's forget about about having various classes of citizens it's
unfair, unworkable and probably against charter rights

1918786844,"Transparency needed on media funding; Falun Gong-linked outlet gets large sum of money, says Stewart Kiff",Aucun(e) disponible.,"while most of canada's conventional media have endured shrinking audiences and revenues in recent years, segments of the ethnic media have seen significant growth thanks to a constant influx of immigrants from all over the world
in the greater toronto area alone, there are about  ethnic media channels targeting various audiences the number of chinese daily newspapers has grown from about five in the s to more than  in 
according to statistics canada, in ,  ethnic communities had populations of more than one million, and others had sizable and growing populations demographic projections indicate that by , nearly half ( per cent) of canadians aged  and older could be foreign-born, or could have at least one foreignborn parent, up from  per cent in 
with those numbers, the ethnic media sector in canada is bound to keep on expanding
the canada media fund (cmf) helps to support this growth it was created by the department of canadian heritage back in  with a mandate to foster, promote and finance the production of canadian content and relevant applications for all audio-visual media platforms various cmf programs support productions reflecting canadian diversity
a closer look at the projects backed by the canada media fund reveals some surprising funding patterns going back to  several production companies affiliated with new tang dynasty tv (ntdtv) have received close to $ million in funding over six years compared to the combined total of about $ million for other ethnic media outlets
studios with ties to ntdtv have received  per cent of the funding allocated through the diverse languages program and have produced the near totality of funded projects in the mandarin and cantonese languages
according to wikipedia, ntdtv is a television broadcaster based in new york city with correspondents in more than  cities worldwide the station was founded in  as a chinese-language broadcaster by practitioners of falun gong, a spiritual practice banned by the chinese communist party
ntdtv's canadian operation, with offices in north york, officially launched on march , , on shaw cable it is also available on novus entertainment in vancouver and on bell fibe tv and rogers cable in eastern canada it is unclear how many viewers ntdtv reaches in canada
so why does this relatively unknown broadcaster outside of the chinese community, and its affiliated production companies, get what seems to be a disproportionate amount of funding compared to other ethnic broadcasters? why are almost all funded chineselanguage projects produced for this broadcaster? and what is known about the content of the material produced for a broadcaster with clear ties to a religious sect? why, for example, are at least three funded projects linked to shen yun, the huge performing arts arm of falun gong that tours extensively throughout the world? many critics have noted that this production's overtly political content and proselytizing supersede its artistic merit
when i spoke to the canada media fund to confirm these figures, they pointed out that cmf is an independent, non-partisan body and that cmf does not intervene in the subjectmatter of funded projects, recognizing each production's creative value and freedom of speech
that is fine, as far as it goes
but in this case an unexpected result is occurring
canada takes pride in its pluralistic and nonsectarian society in spite of the cmf's explanations, it seems odd and most un-canadian that so much public funding is being allocated to a fringe religious group
it is time for a bit more sunshine on what is occurring here stewart kiff is a former reporter and has more than  years' experience in public affairs he is the president of solstice public affairs

436358078,Canada's heartland struggles to be heard:   [SA2 Edition ],"There is much talk in the land of impeaching politicians, including Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (who set up the commission), because they won't do what the people want, and of a need to solve the problems of native Canadians, although so far too few natives have taken part in the forums. The threat of Quebec separation is, of course, also high on the list of problems on the minds of the people. And the reaction to this in the rest of Canada, [Keith Spicer] says, is essentially sadness combined with a belief that if Quebec really wants to go, it should be allowed to go, but only on terms that are fair to both sides. 11:45 a.m: Lunch at the VanDeVelde farm: Beautiful, profitable (but dropped $100,000 in profit last year) family farm three kilometres from little village of Mariapolis. Lasagna, many salads, Nanaimo bars, Mateus wine. Served on Depression china, which used to come in Quaker Oats packages, now valuable antiques. The six children sing grace and serve meal. Spicer, former official languages commissioner who dabbles in many languages, tries to thank farmer Emmanuel VanDeVelde, originally from Belgium, in Flemish. VanDeVelde looks surprised. There is a fairly big crowd, mostly elderly people, to greet Spicer in a neat and clean shopping mall. It's the day before St. Patrick's Day and a piano and banjo duet is pounding out Irish songs. Mayor Coke Hartwell puts a green Irish hat on Spicer's head and Spicer dances with the mayor's wife, Moya, to """"My Irish Rose."""" There is shy, polite applause.","wawanesa, man- wawanesa is nowhere, a little town of a few hundred people on the flat prairie somewhere between winnipeg and brandon in southern manitoba, dying, like many other towns in this vast nowhere because the farms are dying
the farms are dying because wheat prices have dropped from $ a bushel to about $ the wheat prices have dropped because the united states and europe are heavily subsidizing their farmers and canada can't compete
so the big tractor dealership has closed in wawanesa stores along the little main street are shuttered the wawanesa insurance co, one of canada's biggest, which started in , still maintains a """"home office"""" with a staff of about  here, but the """"head office"""" has long gone to a glass tower in winnipeg you can buy a nice house for about $, now in wawanesa
but, oddly, the town has a first-class restaurant, the schnitzel house, as stylish as any in toronto, with gourmet meals elegantly and ceremoniously served it was started by a german soldier sent for training in leopard tanks at the nearby shilo army base who liked the area and came back from germany to settle in wawanesa
on this night, a small travelling group from the citizens' forum on canada's future, headed by chairman keith spicer himself, ends up at the schnitzel house for dinner with some local dignitaries
the restaurant is packed with people who have come from farms and towns far away it is the eve of st patrick's day and a big table of people in green hats is singing irish songs loudly spicer is speaking in french to his press secretary nicole bourget, a franco- ontarian from sudbury
the local dignitaries are talking (in english) about ukrainian prairie settlers to welcome the forum, the waitresses in german costumes hang a cowbell around spicer's neck and plant a big german hat on his head and yodel a german song the wine is good and the huge silver platters of many types of schnitzel overflowing and excellent through the window you can see the shutters on the storefronts down the deserted, snow-covered street
it is all incongruous, a little unreal, a bedlam and a scene that is happy and content and sad and divisive, opulent and suffering at the same time martin o'malley, the journalist and author who will be writing the spicer commission's final report, due july , contemplates it with a writer's relish
""""you know,"""" he says after a while """"you know, i think we might have finally discovered canada""""
whether or not this was so, the search by the spicer commission for the real canada as seen by its people, rather than its politicians and elites, continues
it has been an arduous search, intense, emotional, interesting and, some say, unnecessarily expensive at a cost of about $ million but at least on this leg around southern manitoba it is successful, touching the minds and souls of a lot of often u struggling but thoughtful, knowledgeable and surprisingly patriotic people in what o'malley calls """"an exercise in open-soul surgery"""" and which spicer says is """"like a giant tupperware party""""
it is a search that is uncovering both kindness and toughness in ordinary canadian people, with the toughness stressed by a frightening, fairly common question: should there be a civil war if a separate quebec refuses to give up territory, such as a corridor between ontario and new brunswick? the answer by the groups who consider it are invariably negative, but the question is common
here is a report of two days in the life of spicer and his small team as they crossed the flat and economically afflicted prairies in a borrowed blue diesel minivan in an unusually mild mid-march
saturday, : am: spicer has breakfast with toronto star reporter, westin hotel, winnipeg fruit plate and one egg on toast renews old acquaintance talks of mutual friends he remains optimistic about canada's future, a bit disillusioned but not discouraged (he says) by criticism of the commission tough job, had to be organized quickly, but now, after original blips, it's working there have been more than , moderated or spontaneous discussion groups involving more than , participants to date, more than , recorded phone calls to the  number in ottawa a lot short, so far, he admits, of his flamboyant prediction that the forum would reach a million canadians but now teachers' federations are involved and hope to involve millions of school children
the main theme he and the other  commissioners are hearing, as they crisscross the country encouraging people to talk to each other in small groups, is an almost extreme alienation of the ordinary people of canada from canada's elites, including its politicians of all stripes, but also big businessmen, academics, the big city media
there is much talk in the land of impeaching politicians, including prime minister brian mulroney (who set up the commission), because they won't do what the people want, and of a need to solve the problems of native canadians, although so far too few natives have taken part in the forums the threat of quebec separation is, of course, also high on the list of problems on the minds of the people and the reaction to this in the rest of canada, spicer says, is essentially sadness combined with a belief that if quebec really wants to go, it should be allowed to go, but only on terms that are fair to both sides
a constant theme so far in the forums has been a need for a powerful new form of constituent assembly to decide constitutional questions and the country's future, possibly even consisting of an upper assembly of appointed leading and learned citizens, including professionals, writers, artists and businessmen, and a lower assembly chosen by picking every ,th name in the phone book spicer doesn't dismiss this idea; thinks it should be considered
: am: pack into minivan owned by susan vandevelde, the only manitoba commissioner vandevelde looks to be in her mid-s even though she is the mother of five teenage daughters and a son she's also a farmer's wife and agricultural expert in her own right, an activist in local affairs, and a full-time worker for the farm debt review board, a difficult job that takes her all over the province negotiating between bankrupt farmers and the banks she's charging the commission only mileage for the use of her van
vandevelde was at a local meeting near the family farm when the prime minister's office asked her by phone to become a commissioner, a request that surprised her because she regards herself as an ordinary person and has no ottawa connections
then, after she accepted the post, the phone at the meeting hall rang again and a man who answered said the call was from joe and he wanted to talk to susan
""""joe who?"""" vandevelde asked
""""that's right,"""" the man said
""""and my god,"""" says vandevelde, """"it was joe who""""
spicer sits in the front seat, wearing his trademark, wide- brimmed, black fedora he's wearing old black jeans, which press secretary bourget, in the back seat, constantly nags him to change, but he won't the others in the van are o'malley, spicer's chief-of- staff barbara ursell, the star reporter and the volunteer driver, doug cram, a farmer from morden and also an employee of the farm debt review board
: am, miami: population under  two white grain elevators, some neat white houses, a main street, two or three stores and a meeting hall there are  people in the hall, seated under a canadian flag, seemingly shy at first, then vocal, intense and lucid first the still constant complaint about the federal government's transfer of the cf- repair and maintenance base from manitoba to quebec and complaints about the state of the farm economy
then, briefly, from the reporter's notebook:
why aren't there any paved roads here? they've got paved roads in quebec when it comes to the separation of quebec, if you have a hired man working for you and he wants to quit, don't try to make him stay because he'll be no good for you it's no sense fooling around any longer if they want to go, let them go we need people from all walks of life to settle this crisis, not politicians looking over their shoulders to the next election we have to let quebec know that this time has got to be it
spicer offers the idea of a constituent assembly to solve the quebec and other problems, including the possibility of picking names from the telephone book nobody laughs
: am: lunch at the vandevelde farm: beautiful, profitable (but dropped $, in profit last year) family farm three kilometres from little village of mariapolis lasagna, many salads, nanaimo bars, mateus wine served on depression china, which used to come in quaker oats packages, now valuable antiques the six children sing grace and serve meal spicer, former official languages commissioner who dabbles in many languages, tries to thank farmer emmanuel vandevelde, originally from belgium, in flemish vandevelde looks surprised
""""i tried to say,"""" says spicer, """"thank you for your hospitality""""
""""well, what i thought you said,"""" says vandevelde, """"was 'thank you for the gopher poison' """"
spicer plays the piano for a while and walks in the fields examining the big, gray charolais bulls
the older girls are on their way to university - agriculture, medicine, domestic science rochelle, , says canada, by far, is the best country in the world julie, , agrees
spicer questions the vandeveldes about bulls a top bull can sell for $, their stereotype is outdated bulls are now bred to be docile, content and harmless they have no horns they almost purr like cats when you pat them there are some gay bulls they are shipped to market
emannuel vandevelde works seven days a week, but takes sunday afternoon off, sometimes to fly his plane or ride his motorbike he says canada is a great place
you can buy a nice house for $, in mariapolis a room at the motel is $ there is a store, a credit union, a gas station and a neat, stone catholic church which used to have a nice steeple but it fell off during a tornado
: pm, killarney: another dying town, on a beautiful lake, its economy ailing not only because of the wheat, but also because it's only a few kilometres from the us border and the people do a lot of cross-border shopping
there is a fairly big crowd, mostly elderly people, to greet spicer in a neat and clean shopping mall it's the day before st patrick's day and a piano and banjo duet is pounding out irish songs mayor coke hartwell puts a green irish hat on spicer's head and spicer dances with the mayor's wife, moya, to """"my irish rose"""" there is shy, polite applause
the ladies of the killarney united church, also mostly elderly, put on an irish tea for the forum group in a packed church hall homemade cakes three trumpeters from the school band were to play """"o canada"""" but they've forgotten their music so spicer speaks of people's desire for major changes in the political system and of the people's love of the land when the trumpeters finally play """"o canada"""" they do it very well and the hall resounds with strong, old voices
there are about  people at the killarney collegiate library, seated at tables of six or eight for the forum discussion and the people at the table the reporter joins (three middle-aged men and three young women) are at first skeptical about giving up their saturday afternoon to talk about canada because, they say, what the hell can spicer do about what they think anyway?
but after a while their discussion becomes animated mulroney doesn't do what the people want; he does exactly what he wants to do how can ottawa bargain for english canada with quebec when it's stacked with quebecers? that's like bargaining with yourself how can quebec dictate to the rest of the country when quebec isn't even in the constitution? everybody in canada should be on an equal footing it's by far the best country in the world it just goes to show you, the more you've got the more you want
in the end they said they felt good about being asked what they thought that's the way democracy should be and maybe, just maybe, someone apart from spicer, might listen to them
sunday, : am, brandon:city of , people, still prospering because of economic diversity and because when the small towns die the business moves to the city
spicer addresses the journalism school:  students he's a nice and decent man doing his best in difficult circumstances and his speech this morning is quietly eloquent we're trying to allow the guy in the back row to have his say about canada, spicer explains we're hearing, he says, that the people want to repatriate their own democracy and we're trying to be strategists of hope
he asks the students: """"is there any other place you'd rather live? is there any other passport you'd rather carry?"""" and they shake their heads, no
 pm: the young mayor of brandon, rick borotsik, of ukrainian descent, has declared this sunday """"citizens' forum day"""" and there's a crowd of over  at the keystone arena young women from the canadian tire store, in colorful uniforms, are acting as ushers red- coated mounties form a small guard of honor at the door coffee is free and makes up most of the $ cost of organizing the forum
in the adjacent arena in this huge place the bar  ranch is holding a major sale of big brown simmental bulls that has attracted buyers from south america, texas, and other parts of the united states when the bulls are paraded the auctioneer announces their parentage, weight, and circumference of their testicles spicer, who can't resist any experience, drops in to the bull sale
in the other arena, groups of eight or nine at many tables talk and argue animatedly about canada, its future, quebec, native peoples, multiculturalism, mulroney, politicians, the economy at first just a hubbub, then a babble, then a roar of intense talk so that everyone has to shout to be heard
scraps from the table where the reporter sat:
i'm a german but i'm a canadian first, i love canada if the government didn't fund multicultural groups there'd be no racism multiculturalism has become divisive my mother was french and my father was english so i speak both french and english and love them both, but i'm a canadian we have to do something for the native people but we've taught them to do nothing, we pay them to do nothing, so they drink let's settle the treaties and make them canadians, but we have to tell them once we've lived up to the treaties, don't come back and ask for any more
we have to tell quebec these are the rules we hope you don't leave, but if you do, good luck
no, this is not just another bargaining ploy by quebec, it's not a bluff this time, but we can work it out we can start from the basics and put canada number one if they separate, the biggest loser will be quebec itself if ordinary people from quebec could sit down with us here we could work it all out it's just the elites arguing in both ottawa and quebec, not the people
we'd contribute something to bring quebecers here to learn about manitoba we'd open our homes to them and we'd sit down and respect one another they're nice people but what about the half of quebec that wasn't included in confederation? what about a corridor to the maritimes? what about the buildings in hull? what about the share of the national debt? we have to get down to the nitty-gritty now if a family member wants to leave, it's unfortunate, but he can't take the silverware with him
outside the forum, organizers of the bull sale were chasing after spicer's staff, asking hopefully if the man in the black fedora really was a big bull buyer from brazil
""""just tell them,"""" spicer instructed, """"i'm just a big bullshooter from ottawa""""

the address in calgary is the first of three major speeches manley plans in the next few weeks coupled with the federal budget he delivers in late february, they are meant to build momentum and public interest in manley in advance of the formal kickoff of his leadership candidacy in march, sources say
it's part of a wider campaign strategy that will focus on his budget performance and challenge the liberal party establishment his strategists also plan systematically in the months ahead to expose what they see as inconsistencies in positions held by paul martin, manley's predecessor as finance minister
martin, a backbench mp since june, is the acknowledged favourite in the contest to replace prime minister jean chretien at a november leadership convention in toronto
manley's three planned speeches and the budget- his first since becoming finance minister in june- are to set out policies and a vision for canada that clearly distinguishes him from martin
today's speech emphasizes a theme said to be close to manley's heart- ensuring that immigrants are not left behind as canada evolves toward a modern, knowledge-based economy
""""the first step is to build a truly inclusive society,"""" he says in the text of an address to the alberta wing of the federal liberal party
""""canada needs to develop effective strategies that open doors for canadians of all ages and from all backgrounds we can do more, so immigrants can put what they know and what they have learned to work for them, for their families and the economy""""
sources have said the budget could contain a multi-million- dollar plan to build high-tech training centres for immigrants in communities across the country
today manley will stress another of his main themes- that canadians can win in a global economy
""""i know many people feel threatened by the changes they associate with globalization,"""" he says """"i understand those fears but i do not share them""""
the nation has proven for a decade that free trade can lead to prosperity, a more modern economy and many thousands of new jobs
""""canada has been the world's greatest success story over the past  years""""
manley says the government must spend wisely and not slide back into a deficit but he also hints at new tax cuts
the liberals will make good on the five-year, $-billion tax- reduction scheme promised in  and """"we can do even more,"""" he says
""""i believe we can identify ways to make our tax system foster jobs and growth better than it does now""""
in keeping with earlier government promises, manley suggests the budget will contain new federal spending on health care, children in low-income families, post-secondary education, cities and the environment
his advisers hope to jump-start manley's campaign with an imaginative, farsighted budget that wins wide approval his camp also plans to exploit what it sees as the national executive's failure to force martin-controlled provincial party groups to make the leadership race as fair as possible
manley contends pro-martin officials have not fully opened access to party membership forms candidates need to generate votes at the convention

239549700,Five letters for a thoughful Saturday morning: Never a white country:   [Final Edition ],"The letter stated that ''you cannot educate people to be more tolerant and accepting of changes; adaptation takes time, and time is necessary to prepare Canadians to accept visitors to their house.'' How long is that suppose to take? Native Indians were here long before anybody else, and we all know how well white Canadians are ''accepting'' of them. Furthermore, no one gave them the option to wait when we ''visited'' their house. The fact that the author says white Canadians need to be prepared shows that it's all about color. The only way that white Canadians are going to accept new Canadians is if they totally assimilate into Canadian culture, and that will never happen because skin color can't be changed.","one of five letters published under the same headline
i am writing, not in favor or in opposition to your aug  letter of the day (''do canadians want immigrants, or 'should' they?''), but merely to point out an error in the author's supportive comments
the basis of the letter seemed to be that if white canadians are not psychologically prepared to accept ''a diversity of immigrants'' they shouldn't be forced to, because this will lead to social unrest the letter cited the halifax and montreal riots as examples in both instances, the basis of the riot was not immigration but color, and the two do not go hand in hand too many people assume that if someone is not white, then he or she is a recent immigrant i say ''recent'' because, black or white or whatever, unless we are native indians, we are all immigrants
the earliest documented arrival of blacks in canada was in , when mathew da costa entered nova scotia with the poutrincourt-champlain expedition he interpreted the language of the micmac indians, indicating that he must have been in canada beforehand in order to have learned the language
there is also documentation of blacks in quebec as early as  an estimated  per cent of the united empire loyalists who fled to canada were black, and this estimation does not include those who were brought here as human property by , in ontario alone, the estimated black population ranged as high as , out of a provincial total of ,
my point is that canada has never been an all-white country why should canada's white population be considered special, and why should we have to wait until they can accept other people before adjusting our immigration and multicultural policies?
the letter stated that ''you cannot educate people to be more tolerant and accepting of changes; adaptation takes time, and time is necessary to prepare canadians to accept visitors to their house'' how long is that suppose to take? native indians were here long before anybody else, and we all know how well white canadians are ''accepting'' of them furthermore, no one gave them the option to wait when we ''visited'' their house
the fact that the author says white canadians need to be prepared shows that it's all about color the only way that white canadians are going to accept new canadians is if they totally assimilate into canadian culture, and that will never happen because skin color can't be changed
it is not ''rushing the political agenda of an outspoken minority'' that endangers the future of this country, it's a system built on white supremacy that teaches its citizens white people's wants must come before the basic human rights and needs of other peoples
an accurate historical education is what's needed books such as black canadians by headley tulloch, canada and its people of african descent by leo w bertly, and they came before columbus by ivan van sertima would be an excellent place to start stop the ignorance and you'll stop the violence

""""it allows you to approach anything on the basis of nothing is too ridiculous, nothing is too outrageous to consider,"""" mr asper told a maclean's magazine writer in  """"the fundamental premise is, you have no idea of where it's going to go except you know that you never lose track of what you're doing  jazz musicians do that all the time take off on a lick, and push it to the absolute limits""""
a talented piano player, mr asper was once offered a regular gig at a nightclub in minneapolis but he was bound for a different stage, and launched a successful practice as a tax lawyer
he was married in , and he and wife """"babs"""" would have three children -- david, gail and leonard
by all accounts, mr asper was bright, brash and ambitious he succeeded in an early venture that became manitoba's first liquor company but politics beckoned and, in october , he was elected leader of the provincial liberal party it was a phase of his life he later described as """"a fit of idealism""""
his ideas included workfare and the rolling back of capital gains taxes, a platform that would find resonance with many conservatives but manitoba was ndp country then, and despite winning a seat twice in the legislature, mr asper did little to shake premier ed schreyer's hold on the electorate
by the time he stepped down as liberal leader in , mr asper had already planted the seeds of his fortune
his  purchase of a bankrupt north dakota tv station would be a turning point in mr asper's life and career the station's equipment was shipped to winnipeg and became part of cknd, an independent broadcaster and the foundation of canwest -- a merchant banking operation that would give rise to the upstart global television network
his partner in the cknd venture, future manitoba lieutenant governor peter liba, later recalled the episode
mr liba, who had served as mr asper's legislative assistant, remembered the two of them discussing what to do with the rest of their lives when their futures as liberal politician and aide looked washed up one day, mr liba saw an ad in the paper by the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission seeking applications for an independent television station in winnipeg
he figured that with his own journalism background and mr asper's fascination with the media and connections with potential investors, they could do it that was the beginning of canwest
mr asper """"is one of the most determined and focused persons i've ever met -- when he sets out after something, he doesn't stop until he achieves it,"""" mr liba recently told an interviewer
over the objections of some canadian cultural nationalists, global thrived on a popular hunger for hit us programming by the s, shows such as seinfeld and the x-files were pumping pure gold into canwest coffers such successes gave mr asper the assets and confidence to make broadcasting investments in australia, new zealand and ireland, as well as specialty tv and eventually internet and radio interests
throughout the company's growth, mr asper clashed with broadcast regulators and surprised industry analysts his determination and unabashedly direct style gradually transformed the media mogul into a media personality
""""somebody is always lecturing izzy asper, patiently trying to explain why he can't do something he has just finished doing,"""" canadian business biographer peter c newman had written years earlier """"he sits there, looking a bit like an exhausted final-year law student swotting for his exams, good-humouredly going along with the gag, never bothering to remind his well-meaning mentors that you've either got chutzpah or you haven't, and that if you've got it like he's got it, the tidy rules by which the canadian establishment works just don't apply""""
mr asper was known to rub shoulders with global business leaders and top politicians, but he was said to have kept his taste for simpler pleasures, delivered to his home from a winnipeg burger joint
in , mr asper's chutzpah made national headlines -- and brought controversy again -- when he purchased most of conrad black's canadian media holdings and became the country's largest newspaper publisher
critics decried what they deemed a worrisome combination of print and broadcast holdings under the canwest umbrella the criticism grew louder when canwest acquired full control of the national post a year later
but mr asper, who by then had groomed his younger son, leonard, to take the reins of what was now a multi-billion-dollar company, saw a visionary strategy of media convergence where his critics saw dangerous media concentration
the $-billion deal with hollinger inc had cemented canwest's position as a multimedia powerhouse with diverse interests in television, radio, newspapers and the internet
with the biggest deal in the company's history behind him and his son firmly in charge of canwest, the -year-old mr asper began devoting more time to his many charitable pursuits
- - -
in august , he won the prestigious edmund c bovey award for leadership support of the arts the award, presented annually by the council for business and the arts in canada, recognizes business leaders who have contributed vision, expertise, time and money to benefit the arts
""""he's a remarkable canadian entrepreneur who has ensured that the company of which he is the majority shareholder makes a significant contribution to improving our quality of life,"""" said sarah iley, president of the council """"canwest global sponsors all kinds of arts activities and events, from ballet to jazz, and the executive chairman himself is a renowned donor and volunteer fundraiser""""
earlier, mr asper had donated $ million for a chair in entrepreneurship at the hebrew university of jerusalem his family has also been a major supporter of winnipeg-area hospitals and research centres
but mr asper's crowning achievement as a philanthropist promises to be the new winnipeg-based human rights museum, a $-million project which earlier this year received a $-million kickstart commitment from the federal government on top of a $-million pledge from mr asper's own charitable foundation
the centre, touted as a shrine to racial tolerance and cultural diversity, is aimed at providing the manitoba capital with a signature architectural landmark
mr asper described the project as his philanthropic """"magnum opus,"""" and added that """"this is not and was not ever an asper ego trip this was something that i think has to be done""""
there were many tributes issued yesterday after the news of mr asper's sudden death at age 
""""izzy was a wonderful person he was blessed with great leadership skills, abiding compassion for others and a truly winning way with people,"""" said prime minister jean chretien in an official statement """"his contributions to his community and country will not be forgotten above all, izzy always remained a regular guy""""

but let's remember: today's challenges have been lived by women, particularly black women and other women of colour, for decades every woman and girl who ever dared to stand up has chosen to challenge
as a black muslim woman, i have been a voice for change particularly at the intersection of racism, sexism and islamophobia but i'm just one example, as we've all had experiences that forced us to choose to challenge, whether it's standing up to a bully or campaigning against discriminatory policies
un women announced this year's iwd theme as """"women in leadership: achieving an equal future in a covid- world"""" the canadian government has also called for celebrating the contributions of women and girls, while renewing discussions about the importance of gender equality in canada and around the world
there's no better time to challenge such realities, as covid- rolls back many gains for gender equality from layoffs, to lack of child care, to the rise of domestic violence, women have carried the brunt of our current crisis canada's economic and social recovery plan must include empowering women

fights like these have inspired me for the past  years after surviving the civil war in somalia, i committed myself to helping immigrant women and girls in canada and abroad
i've conducted research at home and abroad on the plight of somali women, who continue to be at the forefront of choosing to challenge their often extraordinary circumstances of war and migration in , i co-founded the somali women's circle network (swcn) to include somali women's perspectives when it comes to principles of inclusion, good governance, justice and education the organization has helped dissolve barriers faced by somali women, particularly when it comes to seizing more positions of leadership
we must choose to challenge by choosing to act this is especially important for our youth, who fight an uphill battle against practices that often excludes their voices
we must choose to challenge by choosing to act this is especially important for our youth
after my daughter became a pre-teen and started wearing the islamic headscarf, i shifted my activism locally and created a girls' mentoring program in ottawa in  we found a great deal of interest and success in mobilizing young women to help create much needed girls' spaces
choosing to challenge means choosing to empower our girls by building their confidence this is especially true in canada, which has seen an increase in islamophobic attacks, particularly in edmonton, where five visibly muslim women were attacked in a span of weeks when it comes to their head scarf, in quebec muslim women are being denied their freedom to choose being a muslim woman in canada has never carried more challenges
fortunately, courageous muslim women are everywhere, whether it's ginella massa becoming the first hijab-wearing journalist at the cbc to get her own show; maryam monsef assuming the role of the minister for women and gender equality; nadia abu zahra holding the joint chair in women's studies at carleton university and the university of ottawa; sarah attia serving as the youth director for the muslim association of canada (mac) and board member at the national alliance of children and youth (nacy); ikram jama, who advises carleton university on human rights and equity; or mahmuda khan becoming the executive director of human concern international these women empowered themselves by piercing social biases, and continue to make history as visible change makers
we must follow their example to advance gender equality in our communities our resistance - our #choosingtochallenge - is what empowers us, so there's no time to be apologetic for our youth and daughters, international women's day should be about celebrating powerful examples of women leaders
there's no better time than now for choosing to empower oneself as a woman in canada, muslim or otherwise but let us move beyond platitudes choosing to empower means choosing to act if not for ourselves, then for our girls and daughters, who deserve more than just a seat at the table in an equitable world

older workers are bearing the brunt of the massive changes and cutbacks going on in the canadian workplace, according to a major new study of the aging work force
those workers who jump or are pushed into early retirement are finding themselves in a period of ``churning'' -- struggling to find any kind of job to get them through to retirement age, says victor marshall, the study co-ordinator and director of the centre for studies of aging at the university of toronto
``in this economy, older workers are sitting ducks -- expected to bow out gracefully when it may not be appropriate,'' said joanne gard marshall, a member of the research team many still have young children at home or have just started second families
they have to get back into the work force and if they're lucky, they will find another job -- dubbed a bridge job -- to get them through to pension age, says the study, released last week it typically not as good, is often part-time and in another industrial sector with poorer pay and poor or no benefits
a team of researchers at u of t spent three years studying the aging work force at five canadian and two american companies for the federal human resources development department -- the first major study of its kind
the companies included:
- nova corp of alberta, a natural gas and petrochemical company with more than , employees, considered a ``large part of the alberta economy'' that has radically restructured more than three-quarters of the workers say they expect to retire early because the company will force them to
- the montreal garment industry, where there is a ``strong pattern'' of unionized shops declaring bankruptcy and re-opening six months later as non-union shops, contracting out the work to low-paying, unsafe sweatshops and immigrant home workers older workers who lose their jobs in the process often end up on welfare
- slater steel of hamilton, which has adamantly refused to lay off any steel workers in the past  years despite major downsizing in the industry
- some , bell canada workers who took early retirement between  and  the company has now embarked on a second massive downsizing, aimed at workers  to , to eliminate , more jobs by 
corporate restructuring effect
when the project began, researchers had the ``naive notion'' there would be a shortage of workers in eight or  years because there would be fewer young people to take their places, and older workers would have to be retrained, says victor marshall
but the continuing recession and downsizing have changed all that instead of delayed or gradual retirement, improved working conditions for older employees, enhanced benefits and other incentives to keep them on the job, the opposite has happened
``we certainly found demography was a secondary phenomenon here,'' he said ``what really driving the lives of workers is what happening in terms of corporate restructuring''
the study warns that ``in this climate, there is a danger that companies will lose much of the experience and knowledge base held by their older workers if a large proportion of these employees depart
``older workers carry the institutional memory of an organization with them, and have the experience, tacit knowledge and maturity to deal with many critical situations that occur on a day-to-day basis,'' it says
but the old pattern of organizing work into stable careers is rapidly disappearing, as is the whole notion of retiring around the age of , it says
the average retirement age in canada is now  and falling, according to a recent report, and almost two-thirds of men retire before they turn 
the impact of all that change was different in every corporation the u of t team studied, marshall said
``you miss a lot of what happening to people if you only look at the over-all numbers''
marshall said he was surprised at the extent to which older workers are considered a strength by employers
``i had anticipated more negative attitudes to older workers from management and younger workers,'' he said ``younger workers have less favorable impression of older workers than older workers do of themselves -- but on the whole, they were all very positive''
among the study other findings:
- in every company, older workers are perceived to be in poorer health than younger ones but in fact, the younger workers report more health problems at slater, ``it was the younger workers who had difficulties with health symptoms, as well as more work and family problems,'' said anil verna, who headed that study ``there a generational divide and the two don't talk to each other about it''
- older workers are also seen by younger workers to be having difficulty adjusting to technological change but in most cases, the older workers had more positive attitudes about the changes than their younger cohorts
- older workers in all the companies had serious anxiety problems about early retirement all were worried that the canada pension plan won't be there for them and their pensions wouldn't be enough o live on yet, many had no idea what benefits they were entitled to
at nova, where workers on average predict they will retire at , ``the level of unawareness of nova company policies and practices, both among employees and managers is striking,'' the study says
despite the number of workers at slater who had taken early retirement, ``there was very little notion of what that would be like,'' verna said yet, the steelworkers who had taken early retirement overwhelmingly said that although they left ``kicking and screaming'' because they felt the company didn't want them anymore, ``within a year they thought `this is great, i wish i had left sooner,' `` he said
the study found nova corp was going through the most radical upheaval of any of the companies it adapted an ``age-neutral'' approach to restructuring and every worker was offered early retirement, an educational leave, $, to quit and start up their own business, and other retirement incentives
nova has convinced its work force that it should no longer count on a lifetime career there, the study says
``the mind shift that is occurring --away from the traditional life-long career in one company toward a self-managed career in multiple settings -- was one of the most notable findings at nova,'' it concludes
``such a shift brings with it a questioning of the concept of long-term company loyalty which, in the past, has been seen as a major strength of older workers''
while managers and employees at nova are aware of the shifts occurring, ``there is little evidence that specific human resources policies have been put in place to deal with these changes,'' the study says
slater steel was the most loyal to its work force, adapting a no-layoffs policy
``the company is age-blind,'' verna said, and offers programs uniformly to everyone, despite having a work force with an average age of 
ignoring the age issue
but with no policies to address the aging work force, ``the company is likely to find itself in a position where it running into problems and can't respond to them because they don't look at the age issue,'' he said
and although new training programs were available to all employees, older workers at slater don't take them because they feel they're too old or it too much trouble
while few older workers say they are discriminated against, ``nevertheless, with the best of intentions, the fate of older workers is different,'' marshall said
companies are using early retirement to cut their work force -- an option that is really only available to older workers
as well, more men than women can take that option because women traditionally take at least some time out of the work force to have children and don't accumulate as many years of service, he said
despite the massive changes going on,''employees are blissfully ignorant about what happening,'' he said ``you ask them about retirement and they don't know they haven't thought it through
``a lot of people are still in the mode of the old-fashioned career,'' he said ``there is not a great appreciation of the need to think about this''
but if there is age discrimination, it not happening in the work place, said verna
``older workers who have a job can make it,'' he said
``once you lose your job -- if you're out of the labor force trying to get back in -- that where the true discrimination takes place, at the point of hiring and that where more research is needed''

also, applicants over  years of age are once again exempt from the language and knowledge tests for citizenship under the amended citizenship regulations to be announced by immigration minister ahmed hussen on wednesday
the changes will be welcome news for the many prospective applicants who have been holding off their applications since the newly elected liberal government introduced bill c- in march  the bill reverses the more stringent changes adopted by its conservative predecessor to restrict access to citizenship
citizenship applications are expected to go up, reversing the downward trend seen over the last few years after the harper government raised the residency requirement for citizenship - requiring applicants to be in canada for four years out of six - and stipulated applicants between ages  and  must pass language and citizenship knowledge tests
immigrant groups and advocates have said the more stringent rules discouraged newcomers' full integration and participation in the electoral process

despite the anticipated surge in citizenship applications as a result of the relaxed requirements, hussen said the department will ensure resources are in place to respond however, he insisted there is no plan to reduce the current citizenship fee of $ for adults and $ for those under 
the changes announced wednesday are part of the amendments that received royal assent in june, including repealing the law that gave ottawa the power to strip citizenship from naturalized citizens for crimes committed after citizenship has already been granted, as well as handing over the power of citizenship revocation to the federal court from the immigration minister

""""it's simple, really,"""" he said in a recent visit to montreal to promote the tour """"i'm aging and i don't want to be too old to be on stage
""""so this is my last big tour maybe after i will give some shows here and there, but not many i will stop definitely, completely, when i get to  years old, which is not too long""""
laughing and smiling, the singer famous for la boheme, les bons moments and emmenez-moi among hundreds of other classics, is quiet for a moment when asked whether he is the last of a generation of great chansonniers, a singer of romantic theatrical love songs and booming, dramatic ballads
""""yes, i'm the final one i think,"""" he says finally """"it's sad about charles trenet and gilbert becaud (they both died last year) and now here i am getting so old, too
""""but there is still this tour, and still more music from me""""
aznavour holds a special spot in his heart for canada, where he had first international success in  playing with his pianist partner pierre roche for  straight weeks at le faisan dore showbar on st laurent boulevard in montreal
he and roche had come to north america to play new york city and took a two-week side trip to montreal that lasted nearly a year and brought him acclaim that had eluded him to that point in france
for the young singer, the adulation of montreal audiences was extremely gratifying -- and good for his ego, especially the attention from women """"i was  -- not a baby, but still a lamb,"""" he says with a smile """"i had much still to learn, and i was a good student, i think""""
born in paris in  to armenian immigrant parents, the young shahnour aznavurjan was a child actor before he found his niche as a singer-songwriter in his early s, changing his name along the way
soon, he was writing songs for the giants of the french musical halls, maurice chevalier and edith piaf, and it was with piaf that he and roche travelled to new york in '
he split with roche in  and ventured out on his own, learning the hard way about tough audiences and the sting of media criticism
""""the worst part of my career happened in the beginning, when the press was against me,"""" aznavour recalls with a wince """"the public couldn't stand my kind of look and kind of songs and voice""""
but as the 's wore on, the public and press began to warm to his work for reasons that remain largely a mystery to aznavour
""""maybe it took some time for them to catch up to me,"""" he says """"or maybe i got a little better as time went on""""
eventually, aznavour added professional acting to his repertoire, appearing in dozens of films, most famously in francois truffaut's shoot the pianist
over the years, he has also become renowned for his philanthropy, especially the aznavour for armenia charity he established shortly after his ancestral homeland was hit by a devastating earthquake in  it is estimated that , people died and half a million people lost their homes
he insists his charity's funds go directly to the people, and are not handled by government agencies """"i work especially for the kids,"""" he says
""""first, i started constructing little houses for people after the earthquake after that i worked on (getting) prosthetic limbs for children who had lost a leg or an arm""""
as he prepares to move into some sort of retirement, aznavour is asked about the best thing to ever happen to him
""""oh, my career,"""" he says without pause """"it was a stage where i could share my love of music with people who also love music""""
as for his opinion on today's pop performers, he especially admires elton john and ray charles """"their talent is enormous elton john is a creator ray charles is a re-creator they are giants""""
what can the nac audience expect from him next week?
""""nothing new,"""" he answered """"i'm not going to try to impress the public by doing something different than what i have always done before my work is to come and sing songs that people expect and love -- and this is exactly what i will do""""

It wasn't -- the attack was part, a small part, of a bigger, less successful British battle of Arras. Then, the Canadian Corps itself was not an independent and all-Canadian formation. British heavy artillery played a major part in the Vimy operation, the Canadian Corps's leader was Lt.-Gen. Sir Julian Byng, a British officer and Canada's governor general from 1921-1926, and almost all the senior general staff officers who planned the battle were British regulars. Certainly, Vimy did not mean that the war was won, and the struggle went on for 19 months more. But the Canadian Corps had become something special in its own soldiers' minds and in the minds of senior Allied commanders. It was now a corps d'elite of shock troops, and when the enemy saw the Canadians coming into the line, it prepared for the worst. Soon under command of Sir Arthur Currie, this nation's greatest soldier, the Corps won its battles at Hill 70 and Passchendaele. Photo: Canada Department of National Defence / Library and Archives Canada PA-001879 / A naval gun fires at night over Vimy Ridge behind Canadian lines during the 1917 battle. Historian [J. L. Granatstein] says the soldiers knew they had accomplished a major achievement by winning Vimy.","we usually mark th anniversaries, pay attention to diamond jubilees at the th, and celebrate the th anniversaries of great events but on april  this year, easter monday, canadians will mark the th anniversary of the canadian corps's taking of vimy ridge during the great war
the victory was important, but just why it is being celebrated this year rather than in  likely has more to do with the refurbishing of the vimy memorial -- restored to the condition it was in when unveiled in  -- than with the battle
still, after major commemorations to mark the th and th anniversaries of d-day and v-e day, it is surely time that we remember the great war: , dead, , wounded, and a record in battle that established the canadian corps as an elite formation
vimy ridge was the corps's first great victory, a perfect set- piece battle that seized the ridge that looked out over a large swath of german-occupied northern france the four divisions of the corps, fighting together for the first time, drove the germans down the ridge and back to their new lines to the east
the victory was hailed in allied capitals, and in canada the population saw it as an indication that a great new nation had been born in battle it may even have been true, though french canada, unhappy with the war and fearful of conscription, tended not to share in the celebratory mood
to the soldiers at the front, the victory was hugely important letters home make this very clear -- everyone understood that they had participated in a major event the planning had been well-nigh perfect, each infantryman and sapper seeing the maps and hearing the briefings, and the rolling artillery barrage had led the advancing infantry in measured bounds
the enemy guns had been pounded into submission by a counter- battery campaign, and the german trenches had been flattened by a long pounding from massed artillery it was a grand achievement, a triumph of canadian arms, the stuff of myth
and myths there were and are the first is that vimy was an all- canadian show it wasn't -- the attack was part, a small part, of a bigger, less successful british battle of arras then, the canadian corps itself was not an independent and all-canadian formation british heavy artillery played a major part in the vimy operation, the canadian corps's leader was lt-gen sir julian byng, a british officer and canada's governor general from -, and almost all the senior general staff officers who planned the battle were british regulars
canada had almost no staff-trained officers in august  when war began, and it took time to bring civilians and militiamen to the requisite standard
even more striking, a substantial majority of the soldiers of the canadian corps on that april ,  had been born in britain, and those proportions would not finally be altered until the very end of the war when the military service act put conscripts into uniform
the british-born had personal ties to home, to britain and its cause, and those others whose families had been in canada for generations required persuasion to enlist francophones were hardest to persuade, but then neither did the english-speaking automatically have the impulse to serve nor, though many were recent immigrants, did germans, jews and ukrainians many had fled europe to escape autocracy, conscription and war and had no desire to return
nonetheless, the vimy victory had a huge nationalizing impact at the front the british-born soldiers, just as the canadian-born, shared in the sense of accomplishment they had captured the ridge that had defeated the french and british armies; they had done it, canada had done it, the canadian corps had triumphed there was no great breakthrough, however, no cavalry squadrons surging through the hole torn in the enemy lines, and the more than , killed and wounded made it a costly victory
certainly, vimy did not mean that the war was won, and the struggle went on for  months more but the canadian corps had become something special in its own soldiers' minds and in the minds of senior allied commanders it was now a corps d'elite of shock troops, and when the enemy saw the canadians coming into the line, it prepared for the worst soon under command of sir arthur currie, this nation's greatest soldier, the corps won its battles at hill  and passchendaele
in august  and in the great campaigns of """"the hundred days"""" that brought the first world war to its end, currie's men established an imperishable record, even if it is one that most canadians have forgotten the victory at vimy must be remembered because it began the canadian corps's months of unending triumphs
the great national monument atop the ridge, once more resplendent, commemorates the more than , canadians killed in france who have no known grave on a site given to canada by france, the towering memorial forever marks the victory of  years ago every canadian should see it, and the war cemeteries where canada's sons lie
a nation exists because its people accomplished great deeds in the past and believe more can be accomplished in the future the taking of vimy ridge was one of the greatest of those deeds

i'm rejoicing as i write, full of praise and thanks- for love and life and food and friends and family and good health and the privilege of waking up to a crisp, sunny october day
for peace
for the simple pleasure of strolling the neighbourhood without fear of snipers or terrorist bombers or religious fanatics or racist punks
today is thanksgiving day and even if, like an estimated  canadians, i were to die overnight, there little to regret, not much to mourn or cry about, save the sadness that all people in every land and every city don't have the advantages we have here in toronto, ontario, canada are we ever blessed; are we ever spoiled
we live in one of the best countries in the world by most standards we live longer, more pampered, better-educated lives than almost any other people on earth for seven straight years, before we fell to third place, the united nations recognized our quality of life as the best among  world nations
within this favoured country canada, ontario is the richest, most powerful and productive province and our city region, greater toronto, with  per cent of ontario population and the driver of its economy, is blessed above all others
what there not to love about life this thanksgiving day in toronto? compared to our counterparts around the globe, what do we have to complain about, except minor inconveniences?
we wouldn't switch places this morning with the residents in the suburbs of the american capital, where a sniper randomly hunts humans with more deadly accuracy than a boy shooting partridges in a feeding ground
around the world, the carnage and horror are corporate, public, numbingly routine; here they are more often one on one bombs go off in helsinki, bali and always in israel- blasting human bones into flaming fragments
here, our hell is a runaway suv, a domestic dispute, despicable parents who maim their children, a mob execution, a drug deal gone bad, ending with someone shot in their driveway
one lost life is as precious as  but given the choice, the fewer the better we can choose to promote the tolerance and diversity that perpetuates this in toronto, the world greatest ongoing experiment of different people living together
in the midst of dot-com losses and rising personal debt, unacceptable child poverty levels and falling donations to the food bank, and the shame of tent city, there are beacons of hope, many acts of kindness and economic """"problems"""" many communities would die for
the scott mission, near spadina and college, is one of many agencies that will today feed hundreds who have no home, no thanksgiving turkey and no warm embrace of family
tent city squatters are roused from their """"homes"""" and, to the chagrin of the less compassionate among us, are given rent subsidies to find real homes for all our pockets of homelessness and social decline, our society attempts to look after its weaker citizens and it often succeeds
still, on average, we are fat and well-fed and blessed with goods
as if living in canada and ontario isn't more of a blessing than any citizen can hope for, we live in toronto
the city climate, this balmy year notwithstanding, is not what attracting  per cent of canada immigrants here
we have a diverse economy to match our diverse culture and its  ethnic groups
greater toronto is the largest biomedical centre in north america, bigger than boston next to detroit, we are the second- largest auto manufacturer our information technology and telecommunications sector is bigger than new york or los angeles'
a kpmg study shows it costs less for financial services firms to do business in toronto than in boston, chicago, new york, atlanta and la more than a million businesses are in the toronto region, with more than half located in the city proper of canada more than  banks, three-quarters have their headquarters here
this is where tourists visit, albeit in declining numbers, but two-thirds more than montreal or niagara falls and twice as many as vancouver if it going to happen, there a good chance it will happen here the jobless know it; so do the poor, homeless, entrepreneurs and panhandlers
we'll devour hundreds of thousands of turkeys this holiday, washed down with wine and cranberry juice and other libations- and not nearly enough words of thanks
there was a time in this town when the monday newspapers carried reports of weekend sermons it wouldn't hurt to revive that tradition, if only on thanksgiving and holidays centred on concepts more lasting than consumerism
in synagogues and sanctuaries, mosques and temples on the weekend, we were reminded to be appreciative and grateful at my church on saturday, pastor omar palmer screamed himself hoarse imploring parishioners to """"openly, constantly, heartily give thanks""""
""""we whine and complain about the alignment on our car being off while we drive by people waiting on the bus,"""" he said
""""some complain about having to wear the same suit to church two weeks in a row, forgetting those who line up at goodwill for some hand-me-downs""""
it human nature, of course, to complain about the pebble in our shoe, forgetting that others have no shoes, that some have no legs
in coming to canada, a welcome home for refugees and seekers of a better home, if not paradise, we have inherited a treasure the foundation- good government, social inclusion, diversity and tolerance, a peacemaker, not a warmonger- has held up well
we live next to an elephant, but we manage to avoid the united states' most irritating traits a tiny nation of  million, we are protected by the world policeman to the point where we can take our own military security for granted while spending our cash on social security
america deserves our gratitude
we woke this morning with few enemies in the world, the envy of the country and the love of people from a hundred or more countries and cultures and tongues
we are enriched by a clash of cultures that somehow, miraculously, coexist where others spawn conflict by association, we have learned to assimilate and that the opening lesson of the course, toronto , a study of getting along with the world
so, offer a prayer of thanks today for toronto, ontario, canada- a place where we try to lay to rest every grievance of the world

436162108,Weak leaders squander tradition of tolerance:   [FIN Edition ],"Instead, [Bourassa] waited, and in December, 1988 passed [Bill] 178 to override the Supreme Court of Canada decision holding that the unilingual sign law was unconstitutional. It is widely acknowledged that the Bill was not beneficial to the French culture and language in Quebec, or was even related to the challenge of preserving them. The well-known real dangers to the erosion of that culture are demography - the low birth rate - and the overwhelming volume of North American cultural products in English that bombard Quebec. Bourassa was afraid to resist this intolerant backlash to the Supreme Court decision in his own province. By this one act he gave elected government legitimacy to extremism and intolerance. The event marked a serious failure in ethical leadership and greatly angered the English-speaking citizens of Quebec, even though it did little to change their daily lives. This symbolic slap at Quebec minority also gave initial legitimacy to the views of a relatively small band of intolerant extremists in English Canada. IN EFFECT, the silence of federal leaders and Ontario premier validated Bourassa unjust law. The result? Anglophones across the country who had been sympathetic to Quebec legitimate aspirations felt abandoned, exposed and cheated. They could not defend an unjust law; they could not answer the intolerant voices and the growing band of frightened anglophones.","note
canadians are not immune to the worldwide malaise of prejudice and intolerance that many groups feel toward one another since world war ii, however, we have prided ourselves on a growing knowledge, understanding and acceptance of differences among racial and cultural groups
gradually, our immigration opened beyond europe to the far east, the caribbean and africa we called ourselves a """"cultural mosaic"""" rather than a """"melting pot"""" belief in our own sophistication reached a high point in , when we recognized multicultural and minority language rights in the constitution by the mid-s we had made one quite remarkable achievement: it was no longer legitimate for people to voice - even if they held - prejudiced views of other groups
i believed that to reach even that stage was very important in fact, as recently as three years ago, on visits to other countries, especially england, i felt offended by publicly made, offensive racial remarks that would not be countenanced in canada now we are confronted with severe racial and linguistic tensions and can no longer lay claim to that moral high ground so what has gone wrong? were we merely deluding ourselves?
we must recognize that prejudice runs deep and is passed from one generation to another through the family; we need only think about the recent ethnic violence in the soviet union and eastern europe to see the persistence of prejudice we can understand then, that  years of unparalleled prosperity after the war helped mute intolerant views in canada, but those views have never disappeared just ask members of visible minorities
in the past two years the flames of intolerance have flared dramatically at home what has been the cause?
i believe that a country leaders make the conditions and set the tone for moral high ground from the s to the s, we witnessed every provincial government, as well as the federal government, pass human rights statutes through their legislatures, encouraged by public discussion of a high order the human rights acts preceded the charter of rights and freedoms in the constitution act of  our leaders created a climate encouraging racial and linguistic harmony
in , premier bourassa made it a plank of his election campaign to repeal the unilingual french outdoor sign law of bill  this repressive provision, passed in the first flush of victory by a separatist government, was a setback to human rights, but was tolerated as a minor excess to be corrected by a later federalist government
that is exactly what bourassa promised to do why he failed to carry out his promise within a reasonable time after his victory remains a mystery a generous leader would not have waited for a subsequent court decision, and would have acted to replace the provision with one requiring bilingual signs because it was the fair thing to do and it would have been consistent with the advances of the preceding decades
instead, bourassa waited, and in december,  passed bill  to override the supreme court of canada decision holding that the unilingual sign law was unconstitutional it is widely acknowledged that the bill was not beneficial to the french culture and language in quebec, or was even related to the challenge of preserving them the well-known real dangers to the erosion of that culture are demography - the low birth rate - and the overwhelming volume of north american cultural products in english that bombard quebec
the reason for bill  was its political significance to quebec own intolerant ultra-nationalists it is a symbol of the clenched fist, of telling the """"anglos"""" in quebec, and in the rest of canada, who is boss in la belle province
bourassa was afraid to resist this intolerant backlash to the supreme court decision in his own province by this one act he gave elected government legitimacy to extremism and intolerance the event marked a serious failure in ethical leadership and greatly angered the english-speaking citizens of quebec, even though it did little to change their daily lives this symbolic slap at quebec minority also gave initial legitimacy to the views of a relatively small band of intolerant extremists in english canada
that legitimacy could have been countered, if not entirely overcome, by strong condemnation from the leaders in the rest of the country to a man and regardless of party affiliation, they remained virtually silent where were john turner and ed broadbent? afraid of losing votes in quebec? where was david peterson? afraid of offending his neighbor?
where were the opposition voices of quebec - chretien and especially trudeau, the prophet of bilingualism - and, most of all, where was our prime minister? all silent their silence was not a moral silence but a void, based on venal vote counting when we needed leadership we received cynical silence
in effect, the silence of federal leaders and ontario premier validated bourassa unjust law the result? anglophones across the country who had been sympathetic to quebec legitimate aspirations felt abandoned, exposed and cheated they could not defend an unjust law; they could not answer the intolerant voices and the growing band of frightened anglophones
we are now watching the re-emergence of the deep roots of prejudice if quebec can legitimately pass intolerant laws in order to pander to political extremists, why can ontario cities not pass similar symbolic bylaws? indeed, they can and they have
so bourassa negative leadership, acquiesced in by the leaders of the other provinces and federal parties, has undone our fragile and slowly built public rejection of intolerance many canadians have been deprived of this once useful advance by our leaders abandoning the moral high ground
an indication of the loss is the anger and contempt being expressed towards all our leaders by english unilingualists we have entered a stage of destructive cynicism i fear that our present leaders have neither the understanding nor the courage to make amends
this pervasive intolerance barely receives mention in the meech lake context but it infects the debate instead of being influenced by a reasoned discourse on this complicated issue, the public - of whom  per cent admit they do not understand the accord - are responding to a hidden emotional agenda, both within quebec and in the rest of canada
the canadian genius for compromise seems to be dissolved by the corrosive atmosphere our leaders have failed us

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block for visible-minority candidates who ran in the 2003 election was their lack of name recognition.

An impressive curriculum vitae only establishes that you are a good candidate. You can be an environmental engineer, an experienced social worker or a respected school teacher, but profile is more important. Getting involved in federal or provincial parties is not a bad idea, either. The parties possess large networks of experienced election hands who can be persuaded to participate in yet another campaign. The downside is that you get labelled politically, something that can be a disadvantage in municipal and school-board politics, which avoid the party system. You have to weigh the pluses and minuses but always make sure that a municipal campaign is multi- partisan.","minority candidates need to get busy right now, says andrew cardozo
prospective city council candidates are starting to think about the next election, so if visible-minority politicians want to change the complexion of city councils, they should plan on putting in a busy summer
the presence of minorities on city councils in the gta is minimal compared to the percentage of visible minorities in each of the cities while more non-white candidates are running for office, a scarce few get elected
toronto has  council members, only five of whom are visible minorities; that's  per cent in a city whose population is about  per cent visible minority richmond hill, which is about  per cent visible minority, has an all-white council
this lack of diversity can't be blamed entirely on discrimination and negative attitudes candidates must prepare themselves more thoroughly and become better known in the wards they want to represent
this is about the halfway mark between the last election and the next and most serious candidates for everything from mayor of toronto to school board trustee in mississauga should be getting ready to announce their candidacies by early  for the election that will take place on nov  next year
major candidates for mayor usually declare their intentions around jan , and there is no reason for other candidates not to do likewise
but well before running, serious candidates need to make preparations
perhaps the biggest stumbling block for visible-minority candidates who ran in the  election was their lack of name recognition getting known and, more important, getting known to the extent that people will come out to work on your campaign, is crucial an impressive curriculum vitae only establishes that you are a good candidate you can be an environmental engineer, an experienced social worker or a respected school teacher, but profile is more important
local experience, be it in the local united way, the chamber of commerce, the food bank or the teachers' union, is essential in building that profile you need to spend time in the voluntary sector - both rolling up your sleeves and in leadership positions
doing these things within one ethnic community or religious group may give you some experience, but will not get you the kind of exposure across ethnic lines you need to get elected and if your ethnic group is a substantial bloc in the ward, count on more than one candidate from that group running ethnic identity gets you only part way to success
find a cause you believe in and be a genuine volunteer the good thing about the voluntary sector is that it acts like a screening process those who contribute in a genuine way gain potential supporters; those who join boards to pad a resume usually just pick up a bad reputation
getting involved in federal or provincial parties is not a bad idea, either the parties possess large networks of experienced election hands who can be persuaded to participate in yet another campaign the downside is that you get labelled politically, something that can be a disadvantage in municipal and school-board politics, which avoid the party system you have to weigh the pluses and minuses but always make sure that a municipal campaign is multi- partisan
getting involved in the federal election that will take place between now and next spring could be a good idea, if only to expand your networks and learn about electioneering - keeping in mind there are differences between federal and municipal campaigns
building a team of experienced election workers also is essential well-meaning and hard-working novices are no match for those who have done campaigns before there are a million rules and tricks that the veterans can guide you through, not to mention the all-important fundraising
the numbers for visible-minority representation at the provincial and federal level are not a lot better, but the solutions are easier as political parties can play a benevolent big brother kind of role to ensure diversity - if they so choose
municipal elections are more like the law of the jungle voter turnout is very low and incumbents have the best chance of getting elected because of their name recognition with no parties to back them up, new candidates have to work hard to overcome the advantages of incumbency

french president francois hollande said his country's strict and long-standing adherence to the separation of church and state has allowed french residents from all different backgrounds to get along
""""secularism is a principle that allows us to live together and, of course, to respect each others convictions and religions,"""" hollande said following a meeting with marois at the french presidential palace, according to la presse
france, which first legislated state secularism in , banned muslim head scarves in schools in 
""""we passed this law, which has existed since  and which has been wholly accepted and which, today, is not up for discussion i don't have any lessons for other countries, but i am able to give this example""""
the values charter proposed by marois's parti quebecois would prohibit all those who draw a salary from the public purse from wearing conspicuous symbols of their faith in the workplace it would apply to doctors, teachers, daycare workers, nurses, university professors and bureaucrats alike the legislation will be put to a parliamentary commission in january where the hearings will likely result in a rehash of the passionate arguments that have divided quebec since word of the initiative first leaked out in late august
marois has defended the proposition as a way to bolster quebecers' common values against what her government argues is an increasing, and increasingly unreasonable number of requests for religious exemptions from secular norms in the workplace, in schools, or in society
""""i'm listening to you, francois and it's incredible,"""" marois said """"i swear that i didn't put these words in his mouth but they are exactly the same ones that i use in quebec when we speak about our proposition""""
the quebec premier said her meeting with hollande, which also touched on issues such as free trade between canada and the european union, left her """"inspired"""" to push ahead with the values charter
but critics of the pq bill will likely pay more attention to the series of reports that have come out in france recently recommending an overhaul of government measures to integrate immigrant populations who often have trouble settling in and finding work in the country

Yet India high commissioner to Canada has denied that any pressure was applied on Canadian officials.

Clark claimed the organizations included violent militants, but he was justly accused of smearing an entire ethnic group.","ottawa - it easy to like a loser who makes good
until recently that how most candadians have felt about joe clark
the well-meaning but accident-prone former prime minister was ousted from tory leadership after blowing the  election but he been no joke as an external affairs minister
after watching him get stabbed in the back by his own party, it was hard to resist cheering when clark bounced back to become one of the most able ministers in the mulroney cabinet
with eloquent realism he addressed issues ranging from racism in south africa to the struggle for democracy in haiti clark blend of toughness and compassion won the respect of opposition members as one after another of his cabinet colleagues was tarnished by controversy and scandal, clark star kept shining brighter and brighter
the tables had turned soon there were murmurs that the conservatives would be a lot better off if clark were back at the helm, instead of brian mulroney
but you don't hear much of that talk today
the man who has been one of the mulroney government biggest assets may prove to be one of its liabilities if the government is rejected by ethnic voters in the next election, much of the blame will be placed on clark
he already worsened the government reputation among human rights activists and refugee aid organizations the damage was done this week when a toronto newspaper revealed that clark used his influence to try to reduce the number of sikhs being accepted by canada as refugees
in a june  letter to former employment and immigration minister benoit bouchard, clark said he found it """"most disconcerting to learn that a number of sikhs recently were recognized as refugees"""" he added that he was particularly concerned that the refugee status advisory committee had begun """"to recommend in favor of sikh refugee claimants""""
the statements have prompted allegations that the government is persecuting a minority group that has already been a victim of racism in canada the government is also rightly under attack for undermining the independence and impartiality of canada refugee determination process
a statement by clark linking immigration appeal board decisions to foreign policy concerns fuelled more charges that the government is ignoring the human rights of refugees in response to diplomatic pressures from abroad
much of the outrage surrounds a personal intervention by clark which apparently caused a former indian army major named santokh singh bagga to be refused refugee status
a distinguished panel of independent officials unanimously concluded last summer that the -year-old man was a true refugee who could face persecution if he returned to india but in a letter to bouchard last april clark wrote that santokh singh was wanted in india """"because of his suspected involvement"""" in subversive activities, including """"a conspiracy to assassinate the indian prime minister""""
clark also said the indian government was applying """"strong and repeated pressure"""" to have santokh singh returned to india yet india high commissioner to canada has denied that any pressure was applied on canadian officials india never sought the extradition of santokh singh and never recommended that he be refused refugee status, according to sj singh chhatwal
the full details behind clark intervention haven't been revealed new light may yet be shed on his actions but he has been left looking like a man with a phobia of the sikh community that impression is re-inforced by reports that canadian security officials could find no evidence of terrorist activity in santokh singh past
the impression is further supported by letters clark wrote last december urging several premiers to boycott the functions of three sikh organizations clark claimed the organizations included violent militants, but he was justly accused of smearing an entire ethnic group
clark is understandably very concerned over suspected sikh involvement in the bombing of air-india flight  in  canada has still failed to solve the bombing, which killed  people
clark also cannot ignore indian claims that canada is harboring sikh extremists who organize terrorist attacks in india yet his actions have been an affront to the vast majority of law abiding people in canada ,-member sikh community
that affront is bound to make members of other visible minorities wary of the mulroney government clark justified attacks on israel mistreatment of the palestinians have upset the jewish community and the meech lake accord is under attack for failing to provide adequate protection to multiculturalisms
the government prospects of taking the ethnic vote away from the liberals appear bleak it has stumbled badly in its treatment of ethnic minorities and the fundamentally decent minister of external affairs bears much of the responsibility",The Windsor Star,1988-05-19,1988,5,19
353376366,A SINGLE IMMIGRATION POLICY IS NEEDED:   [Final Edition ],"A decade-old arrangement with the federal government, the Cullen- Couture agreement, gives the government of Quebec a role in admitting immigrants to that province. Although the federal government gets the final say, those the provincial government wants are seldom rejected (only for medical or security reasons -- and we've seen recently just who can slip through security checks). In general, the Quebec government exercises its power to choose French speakers, although they can apply other criteria. According to a recent report in The Globe and Mail, the province has used its influence to gain admission for about 200 Hong Kong businessmen. Indeed, the naturally federal nature of immigration can be illustrated by the behavior of many of those Hong Kong immigrants to Quebec: they land in Montreal, breathe deeply, and get on the next plane for Toronto or Vancouver. A provincial role in immigration would only make sense if there were immigration-like restrictions on moving from one province to another; fortunately, we don't have any. Some of the objections to the Quebec-special immigration procedure seem to be from people worried that those immigrants won't stay in Quebec, so other provinces will end up with them anyway -- as if they were some sort of burden. They're not. The only truth in that objection is that many of the immigrants do leave that province soon after arrival. Even so, Quebec gets a higher proportion of those immigrants than they do of the immigrant population at large. That suggests if the country eased its immigration procedures, proportionately more immigrants would go to the other nine provinces.","refugees usually leave their lands too late whatever the warnings that the country is becoming unliveable, it's usually impossible to tell when it will happen -- it might be in another month, but it might be another decade; indeed, it might never happen so the situation of hong kong, which will cease to exist when it is turned over to china at a known date () is unique
the chinese government's promises to let hong kong continue its odd existence for  years have elicited more than a little skepticism (similar though less formal promises were made with respect to shanghai; they were not respected even for the duration of mao tse-tung's leadership of china) consequently many residents of hong kong have been making contingency plans for an orderly departure canada is one of their favored destinations
many hong kong residents seeking immigration to canada, particularly businesspeople, are very well qualified, but not all meet the requirements for immigration however, like children who've found that a no from one parent might become a yes from another, they've discovered that canada doesn't speak with one voice on the matter for the federal government isn't the only government to have an immigration department
someone rejected by canada's immigration department can try again at quebec's
a decade-old arrangement with the federal government, the cullen- couture agreement, gives the government of quebec a role in admitting immigrants to that province although the federal government gets the final say, those the provincial government wants are seldom rejected (only for medical or security reasons -- and we've seen recently just who can slip through security checks) in general, the quebec government exercises its power to choose french speakers, although they can apply other criteria according to a recent report in the globe and mail, the province has used its influence to gain admission for about  hong kong businessmen
since it's clear the admission of these hong kong businessmen is not aimed at promoting french language or culture, it's amusing to speculate what the purpose is did quebec government leaders realize their anglophobia drove away a lot of good people and they need to replace them? perhaps government leaders think that, since quebec is actually pretty free (the language restrictions are bizarre but, by world standards, not unusually harsh) the people they take will be so grateful they won't squack at the province's unconstitutional laws
whatever the motive, there are several things wrong with the situation
the first is that provinces should not have immigration departments the main reason to have levels of government is that, in a large country such as canada, local conditions can vary in such a way that a single national policy is inappropriate but in some areas, policies must by their nature apply uniformly to the whole country foreign affairs, including defence, is one of those areas; immigration is another
indeed, the naturally federal nature of immigration can be illustrated by the behavior of many of those hong kong immigrants to quebec: they land in montreal, breathe deeply, and get on the next plane for toronto or vancouver a provincial role in immigration would only make sense if there were immigration-like restrictions on moving from one province to another; fortunately, we don't have any
the second wrong thing is the initial rejection of the applications the requirements for entry to canada are far too narrow, and the proof is that many of those who don't meet the requirements become perfectly good immigrants this is true of more than hong kong businessmen
jim campbell, acting manager of the toronto east immigration office (one of the busiest in the country; people arrive at  am and get a number) said in a toronto star story: """"there aren't five of those  people outside who won't do well in canada, and we know that"""" yet many of those  do not meet the legal qualifications for landed immigrant status often they apply to stay as refugees; campbell says """"only about  per cent of refugee applicantsare legitimate"""" his two statements are not contradictory yes, they'll make good immigrants, and no, they're not refugees; that's just what they had to say to be allowed to stay in the country
some of the objections to the quebec-special immigration procedure seem to be from people worried that those immigrants won't stay in quebec, so other provinces will end up with them anyway -- as if they were some sort of burden they're not the only truth in that objection is that many of the immigrants do leave that province soon after arrival even so, quebec gets a higher proportion of those immigrants than they do of the immigrant population at large that suggests if the country eased its immigration procedures, proportionately more immigrants would go to the other nine provinces
so if there's a fuss to be made from the point of view of provincial relations, surely it ought to be that quebec is getting more than its fair share of immigrants at the expense of the other provinces

there is a potential problem with asian women choosing to abort female fetuses because they prefer to have sons, kale says the proposed solution is to deny all women information about their child's gender until it is effectively too late to have an abortion
kale is right to say that selective abortion of female fetuses is a problem, particularly in india and china it's not difficult to imagine that some immigrants take the same approach here for example, the  census does show a disproportion between the number of boys and girls in canada's indo-canadian population
it's a big leap from that to concluding that all pregnant canadian women need to be treated as if they were likely to choose an abortion if the fetus wasn't of their preferred gender there is simply no basis for such a sweeping change in medical practice
even if it made sense, the cmaj's proposed solution isn't likely to work one can discover that by reading an article in the same edition of the magazine sex-selection abortion is banned in both india and china, but the number of such abortions continues to rise
in the united states, antiabortion republican congressman trent franks wants to make it illegal to choose to abort a fetus based on its race or gender this purported concern for girls and black children is little more than an attempt to ban abortion through the back door
if there is a problem in some canadian ethnic communities, the better approach is for doctors to counsel parents against aborting a fetus based on gender in canada, women have a right to choose abortion in some cases, the reason for doing so might be regarded as deplorable, but that is still a woman's choice

let us consider the history, distant and more recent this is the party of sir john a macdonald, who in the late s somehow bound together disparate nations of refugees from the old world, french and english, irish and scots, yankees fleeing the violence to the south, fenians and orangemen, and aboriginal peoples, under the grand, unifying roof of the parliament of canada sir john's great work created, in effect, the world's first truly pluralist, multi-lingual federation (yes, there was that business with riel, unfortunate to be sure, but treason is as treason does had the upstart been a dual citizen, exile might have spared him the end of a rope this not having been an option at the time, the government did its unpalatable duty)
half a century later there was the great populist john g diefenbaker, whose name we know well from its having been embossed on various federal projects and buildings this past decade prime minister diefenbaker is not, as base rumour would have it, best remembered for killing the avro arrow and having all prototypes of this revolutionary aircraft chopped up and dumped into lake ontario
quite the contrary, diefenbaker was an early and great champion of civil liberties in a climate of national self-examination over the forced internment of japanese canadians during the second world war, he introduced the canadian bill of rights of , which reads, in part: """"it is hereby recognized and declared that in canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely: a the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not be deprived thereof except by due process of law; b the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law; c freedom of religion; d freedom of speech; e freedom of assembly and association; f freedom of the press""""
can anyone fail to see here the provenance of pierre trudeau's charter of rights and freedoms? trudeau the elder simply completed a task begun by his tory predecessor he was executing a conservative vision
now let us leap forward again, to prime minister brian mulroney, who in some respects led the most enlightened canadian administration since wilfrid laurier, advocating both commercial liberalism and racial and linguistic harmony mulroney's fierce opposition to south african apartheid even earned him the admiration of socialist eminence stephen lewis, whom he'd appointed ambassador to the united nations
but the most telling argument of all, my friends, lies in the record of this current conservative government, led by stephen harper much has been made of the tories' recent conflation of islamist fundamentalism with the rule against wearing of the niqab, or veil, at canadian citizenship ceremonies a """"tip-line"""" for the denunciation of """"barbaric cultural practices,"""" by one's neighbours, has been proposed evil-doers, should they be found guilty of treasonous acts and be unlucky enough to possess
dual citizenship, will be defenestrated from the canadian family but would there even have been a harper majority in , had it not been for the votes of recent immigrants, hailing from countries the world over? levels of immigration have never been more robust than they are today the conservative leader himself, in an interview last september with the editor-in-chief of the wall street journal, attributed his party's electoral success to newfound support among """"cultural communities"""" jason kenney was not dubbed the """"minister for curry in a hurry,"""" for nothing it was the liberal party that took support among new canadians for granted for decades, following trudeau pere's unfair hoarding of the limelight for his charter
therefore, honourable jurors, it's quite obvious there can be no deeply felt anti-immigrant ideology behind the conservatives' elevation of the niqab (the wearing of which was an issue for two of the , women who've taken the oath of citizenship in the four years since the rule was imposed) into a galvanizing crisis of nationhood
it's just politics; a bet, based on exhaustive scientific polling, that reflexive antipathy for the burka, the full-body-and-face covering worn by a tiny minority of ultraorthodox muslim women in canada, will translate into a wave of quiet support for conservative candidates this campaign has been a rough haul, my friends; the opposition parties have not obliged the incumbents by lying down and dying, or auto-destructing in televised debate as in the past can anyone blame seekers after power for seeking after power?

it a place where they, their parents and the whole community can feel they belong
tonight, the inner-city school will receive the ruth atkinson hindmarsh award, a $, prize that recognizes and rewards the efforts of ontario organizations to improve the lives of needy children
the largest of its kind in the country, the annual award was established in  in memory of the daughter of former star publisher and atkinson charitable foundation founder joseph e atkinson
she was involved with the foundation for more than  years, including  years as president, a position she held until her death in  at age 
ryerson program of reaching out to meet broader needs in its community, which includes many low-income and immigrant families, impressed the foundation
many of the  students at the junior-senior public school in the bathurst st-dundas st w area are considered at risk
some live in poverty others don't have permanent homes; a few families live in hotel rooms more than two-thirds say english is not their first language, and about  per cent have been living in canada five years or less these children and their families face language and cultural barriers, among other difficulties
""""this school is innovative; it has programs and a way of educating kids in the community that can be replicated and spread to other schools that important to us,"""" says peter armstrong, a foundation trustee and hindmarsh grandson
""""it honours children uniqueness, in that ryerson community school places equal value on kids of all kinds    so in terms of being inclusive, and equitable, and nurturing, it just what my grandmother thought was important for kids""""
the award is for registered charities or organizations associated with a charity about  groups have applied over the past two years; last year honours went to native child and family services of toronto
ryerson funds many of its community programs through a non- profit organization, friends of community schools
principal chris bolton and his staff embarked on the process of turning ryerson into a community school  years ago, the goal being to make it a focal point in the neighbourhood, offering support and resources for families as well as an educational centre for children
""""it is our belief that any school should be connected,"""" bolton said """"it should not be four walls it should be drawing people in, it should be relevant to the local community""""
charles pascal, executive director of the foundation, said that """"what makes (the school) unusual is they (apply) words like partnership, diversity and belonging - words that are easy to say in a mission, but very hard to realize in reality""""
foundation president betsy atkinson murray said she admires ryerson understanding of the multi-economic, multicultural community it serves """"ryerson has such an amazing history of serving the community, and this really is a community-based project, through the auspices of the school""""
the school has links with  social agencies and community groups, says bolton """"it important to wrap around the child all the services to ensure their well-being""""
what going on outside the classroom is just as important as what happening in the classroom, says outreach worker donna harrow
so the school helps families find solutions for home troubles if, for example, they have a plumbing problem and don't speak english well, someone at the school will know where to get help a teacher who speaks the parents' native language can help them learn to solve such problems on their own
the school doesn't offer just a number to call, harrow says, but its expertise in knowing whom to speak to and how to get things done
""""the stress of things can affect students' performance at school,"""" harrow says """"in order to service students, we have to also service their families""""
international language classes are built into students' schedules and aren't simply offered after school or on saturday mornings - one of the things that impressed the atkinson foundation, pascal said
courses offered include mandarin, cantonese, swahili, vietnamese, portuguese, spanish and arabic
students marwa eldardiry, , mohammad hashimi, , sathies tharmeswajakan, , samuel orkin, , and corrine aberdeen, , say they like that they can study another language during the school day
""""i've been to lots of other schools, but when i came here, i felt good,"""" sathies says """"the first school i went to had no international languages at all""""
language instructors make important connections with families, says lisa oliveira, who heads the program for immigrants, that often a lifeline in an unfamiliar country
""""we call them in their own language; they feel good, they feel comfortable to know their language is spoken at school,"""" says oliveira, who been at ryerson for  years and has taught portuguese
ryerson has an innovative parenting and family literacy centre, open to the community, with a multilingual lending library
the centre teaches parenting skills during crucial early years and helps give parents social contacts and a level of comfort with the school well before their children attend
victor wong, , has been going to the centre five years his grandchildren are now in grade , but he enjoys the company
""""some of the chinese who come here don't speak english, and i translate for them,"""" he says """"i sometimes bring people in just to show them around the school""""
a group of parents gathers every other friday they go grocery shopping, sharing the cost, then return to the parent centre, where they learn to prepare a meal later, they divide the food up to take home
ryerson doors are rarely locked community groups use it evenings and weekends; parents hold tai chi classes or upgrade their computer skills on weeknights
how has all this improved students' lives? bolton says there little hard data, but that one way the ruth atkinson hindmarsh award will help a small part of the money will pay for a study
however, anecdotal evidence abounds the school is full of parents and other volunteers all the time - in the parent centre, in classrooms and out in the yard
hanan ali, a mother of four, is at ryerson daily, helping students read or volunteering in the parent centre
she emigrated from egypt  years ago and has lived in the neighbourhood three years
""""when i didn't know the area and needed to make a doctor appointment, they helped,"""" she says of ryerson staff """"i'm a widow, and they helped me find out about getting a lawyer and even wrote a letter to help me get money from the government for housing""""
she says she feels at home when she walks into the school """"we have a saying where i come from: 'it takes a whole village to raise a child' here at ryerson, it the school, the whole community, who raise our children""""
bolton says the programs give parents a real tie to the school
""""if i'd taken a picture of the school  years ago and one today, what you'd notice is the sheer numbers, and the mixture,"""" bolton says
""""it not just kids in the hall, but kids and adults they are talking to their neighbours, stopping and talking to staff there a rapport that developed""""
the school has yet to decide how to spend the rest of the award money, though bolton says it will be for long-term programs
you can bet that students, their parents and the community will have a say in it

with an eye on nationalist movements and rising anti-immigrant sentiment, the pew research center conducted a survey of more than , people in  countries to investigate global perspectives on a thorny idea: what does it take to be """"one of us?""""
in a report released wednesday, pew researchers found language was the most critical factor in how people defined a """"true"""" member of their nation, with the netherlands, hungary and united kingdom placing the highest premium on speaking the native tongue
canadians and italians were the least likely to link language with national identity, though nearly nine-in- canadians (both anglophone and francophone) still felt speaking french or english was """"very"""" or """"somewhat"""" important - despite the fact  per cent of canadians did not consider either to be their mother tongue, according to the  census
in canada,  per cent of , respondents also placed a high premium on shared """"customs and traditions"""" when defining the canadian identity, with only hungary, greece and poland showing larger proportions of people who prioritized shared culture - something that """"jumped out"""" for bruce stokes, the author of the report
""""for whatever it means, canadians seem to value customs and traditions more so than even people in the us or in many of the european countries,"""" said stokes, director of global economic attitudes with the pew research center, a non-partisan think tank based in washington, dc

like all polls, this one has important limitations, including the fact the nebulous phrase of """"national customs and traditions"""" was not defined and left for individual respondents to interpret
canadians in the yukon, nunavut and northwest territories were also excluded from the canadian survey, which was conducted in april and may  and had a margin of error of  percentage points at a -per-cent confidence level
nevertheless, the pew report arrives at a time when pitched debates over national identity are shaping political battles around the world, fuelling nationalist movements in europe and the rise of president donald trump in the us
in canada, federal conservative party leadership candidate kellie leitch has also seized on the debate, proposing that immigrants be screened for """"canadian values"""" she is also pitching the """"unified canadian identity"""" as a centrepiece of her campaign - though her interpretation of the canadian identity remains both divisive and elusive
the pew report found a generational gap in most countries, with older respondents placing a higher value on shared language, culture and birthplace
in north america, divergent views also split along party lines both conservatives in canada and republicans in the us placed a higher value on language and culture when it came to defining national identity, compared to people who identify with parties on the left side of the political spectrum
and in the us, there was also a partisan split on religion, with  per cent of republicans saying christianity is """"very important"""" to being american, versus just  per cent of democrats
(in canada, some  per cent of respondents felt christianity was critical to being canadian - and on the other side of the spectrum,  per cent of greeks said christianity was a crucial piece of their identity)
but interestingly, there wasn't much difference between the value republicans and democrats placed on birthplace - in both groups, roughly a third said place of birth was """"very important""""
most countries also placed a relatively low premium on birthplace compared to things like language and culture - though  per cent of canadians still considered a person's place of birth to be very important in hungary, greece and japan, half of respondents said birthplace was very important
stokes believes that no matter how """"shared customs and traditions"""" were defined by respondents, the survey shows they're top of mind right now for many canadians
""""we don't know what canadians were thinking when we asked this question,"""" he said """"but (candidates like leitch) are picking up something in their own polling, or their own conversations with constituents, that this is an issue on canadians' minds""""
but for jack jedwab, who has also done polling research on the canadian identity, the pew report doesn't convince him that canadian politicians like leitch are picking the right strategy by focusing on national identity and anti-immigrant sentiment
jedwab, president of the association for canadian studies and the canadian institute for identities and migration, notes that the pew survey asked canadians how they felt about """"sharing"""" customs and traditions, which he considers the operative word he notes the word """"sharing"""" in his own polling research has skewed answers in the past
""""it's very hard for me to comment on this question - on the issue of othering or 'us and them,' which is what this poll is trying to get at - when we're not defining what people mean by national customs and traditions,"""" he said
""""it's like 'values' once we get into defining 'customs and traditions,' we may find more disagreement than we realize""""
nigel barriffe, president of the urban alliance on race relations, also thinks the survey results, while unsurprising, only scratch the surface when it comes to defining how most canadians define our national identity

Series: Crisis in the Military:   [Final Edition ]","The offer of a desk job was the last straw for Mr. [Walsh]. He loved flying in the Canadian military and if he couldn't do that there seemed to be no point in staying. Mr. Walsh says he enjoyed his armed forces career but he eventually tired of the constant moving and being on call 24/7. Last year, he took three weeks holidays and was called into work to fly three times a week because of the desperate shortage of pilots. During his tour as a Snowbird co-ordinator, he was away from home 250 days each year for two years straight. So if the air force is so desperate why didn't it make a maximum effort to keep Mr. Walsh? The answer seems to lie in the military bureaucracy. Although Mr. Walsh's commanders wanted him to stay they were no match for the air-force system that, at times, can be unbending. That system seems to dictate that personnel, who have been in a job for a certain time, move on, whether they like it or not and whether or not it is best for the organization.

""""The money is good and I get to fly, which is all I ever wanted to do,"""" says Mr. Walsh.","crisis in the military
comox, bc - rocky walsh is the kind of experienced pilot the canadian air force desperately needs to hold onto
he flew surveillance missions in the former yugoslavia he spent two years as a co-ordinator with the snowbirds, later becoming an instructor on tutor aircraft last year, he piloted an aurora surveillance plane in the search for illegal chinese migrants off the shores of british columbia
earlier this year, the canadian forces looked at mr walsh's  years of flying experience, took into account its critical shortage of pilots, and promptly offered the senior aviator a desk job he would set up briefings on his unit's operations the position was all about pushing paper, not something mr walsh, who joined the military to fly aircraft, ever had any desire to do
it took exactly one month for him to find employment with a civilian airline where he will eventually earn several times his military salary
""""the canadian forces is  pilots short right now and they wanted to move me into a desk job,"""" says mr walsh, , who has been hired by canada  airlines as a pilot """"you tell me the reasoning behind that? nobody can give me a real good answer""""
mr walsh is one of the thousands of highly skilled people who have left the military in recent years, an exodus that defence analysts believe has severely hurt the canadian forces some leave because they tire of the seemingly never-ending string of overseas missions others have found their skills more appreciated, with better salary and better treatment, in civilian employment
the offer of a desk job was the last straw for mr walsh he loved flying in the canadian military and if he couldn't do that there seemed to be no point in staying mr walsh says he enjoyed his armed forces career but he eventually tired of the constant moving and being on call / last year, he took three weeks holidays and was called into work to fly three times a week because of the desperate shortage of pilots during his tour as a snowbird co-ordinator, he was away from home  days each year for two years straight
""""that takes a toll on family life,"""" says mr walsh, who has been married four years """"i believe i've given my time and i just want my life back""""
there were other reasons too the military has changed how it evaluates officers, placing more emphasis on education until this year, the evaluation for a position on the officer merit list was based almost entirely on job performance only  per cent of the merit standing focused on educational background, french-language skills and courses an officer had taken
this year, that changed so that job performance only accounts for  per cent of the merit listing, says mr walsh that means the deck is stacked against pilots like him, who have limited french- language training and a grade  education mr walsh enlisted in the canadian forces when he was  years old, with a commercial and private pilot's licence he had also operated a successful landscaping business in his home town of niagara-on-the-lake but since he joined the canadian forces later in life, he didn't move up through the regular military system, which includes taking career- building staff courses
mr walsh says the military may change the evaluation system to further reduce the emphasis on operational experience for merit standings """"in my opinion that is going to turn the leaders of the military into paper pushers without any operational ability or experience,"""" he says """"that's where i'm seeing the future going and for me that was the last straw""""
for the last three years, the air force brass has maintained that retaining senior pilots was their no  priority in july, the new air force commander, lt-gen lloyd campbell noted that air canada and other civilian airlines are raiding the military for aviators and that the situation will only get worse a military analysis conducted two years ago determined that by  canadian commercial airlines would require almost , new pilots, some  of them to be recruited from the canadian forces
but it is more than a hiring binge by commercial airlines that has contributed to the shortage of military pilots in , the canadian forces was under government orders to reduce personnel to , it determined it had a surplus of pilots and gave buyouts to about  aviators between  and april  some pilots left with $, and were offered jobs the next day at civilian airlines or with other militaries australia and new zealand scooped up a number of cf- fighter pilots, who had been trained by the canadian forces at a cost of about $ million each
but, according to one military analysis, there never was a surplus of pilots in fact, by the summer of , the canadian forces was experiencing a shortage
a briefing for defence minister art eggleton in february , said the high attrition rate among military pilots occurs mainly at the captain level in an attempt to retain pilots, the air force introduced a signing bonus of up to $, for experienced pilots but that has done little to stop the exodus pilots leave because of inadequate pay, decreased opportunities to fly and poor quality of life, say canadian forces officials
so if the air force is so desperate why didn't it make a maximum effort to keep mr walsh? the answer seems to lie in the military bureaucracy although mr walsh's commanders wanted him to stay they were no match for the air-force system that, at times, can be unbending that system seems to dictate that personnel, who have been in a job for a certain time, move on, whether they like it or not and whether or not it is best for the organization """"my career manager said that i had been here flying for two years and that it was now time to move into a desk job,"""" says mr walsh """"there wasn't any flexibility there""""
mr walsh says he considered taking the signing bonus, but after taxes the bonus was only about $, a year for three years in return, he had to guarantee five years of service besides, the prospect of a desk job was too much
in his job with canada , mr walsh will know his flight schedule at least a month in advance that, he says, will allow him to lead a normal family life mr walsh will receive overtime to work non-scheduled hours and he can live in comox where he and his wife, rae, have built their dream house he starts the new job at about half his military salary but in three years he could be making $, a year """"the money is good and i get to fly, which is all i ever wanted to do,"""" says mr walsh

federal emissary lowell murray, in a -minute meeting with mckenna yesterday, suggested progress on multiculturalism might be added to the issues that would have priority in a parallel accord if the constitutional accord passes
but mckenna, who had the idea of a parallel accord in the first place, still wasn't persuaded to pressure manitoba and newfoundland to stop pushing for changes to meech lake
new brunswick and manitoba have refused to ratify meech, and newfoundland is rescinding its approval the accord dies june  if not passed unanimously
""""i believe that the primary responsibility (for winning support for meech) rests with the government of canada,"""" mckenna told reporters after meeting with murray, a senator and ottawa's federal- provincial relations minister
""""let's not get the impression that there are two provinces who are the problem here,"""" mckenna cautioned
""""my view from the outset is that it has been the intransigence of the provinces who signed the accord that represented the problem here""""
mckenna, seen as the most flexible of the three holdouts on meech, also went some distance to dispel that image
while he said he will continue to discuss the impasse with all his fellow premiers, he said it would be more useful for him to speak to those who have signed the deal rather than those who are blocking it
""""they're my allies why would i argue against them?""""
mckenna also sounded glum about the prospects for any solution
distinct society
""""right now the atmosphere is very negative,"""" he said
the accord, aimed at returning quebec to the constitutional fold, would amend the constitution to recognize quebec as a distinct society and strengthen the powers of all  provinces in several areas
each province would be given a veto over senate reform and the creation of new provinces it would also be easier for provinces to opt out of new national shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction
murray is touring provincial capitals to try to find a solution to the impasse
he has said mckenna's idea of a so-called parallel accord, a separate agreement that would allow meech to proceed as is, would only work if it builds on - but does not alter - meech lake
he has also said that some agreement to strengthen minority language rights and some undefined progress on aboriginal rights would have to be part of any such agreement
now he has added multiculturalism to the list and has hinted there are others
but while he reiterated yesterday that such an agreement remains the most promising solution to the meech dilemma, he said even that remains a non-starter so long as manitoba and newfoundland continue to insist that meech itself be changed

""""in summary, it is a rather difficult situation we're in,"""" murray said
""""if it (a parallel accord) is to get off the ground at all we would have to get newfoundland and manitoba discussing a parallel accord rather than discussing rewriting meech lake or starting all over again
""""we would have to get them into the ballpark there would have to be more flexibility on their part""""
he hinted that quebec is willing to compromise on such an agreement, saying: """"i don't see a problem - certainly not in principle - with the other provinces""""

A city-province working group should be established to shape a master plan that will reflect the realities of modern Ontario and its multicultural makeup. The site, however, should also celebrate the foundations upon which the province has prospered.","a master plan essential
to redevelop downtown toronto location
ontario stands to reclaim an enormous piece of its founding heritage as plans are shaped for the recently purchased site of the province first parliament building near the foot of toronto parliament st - but only if planners withstand the economic and politically correct pressure to think small
at this point in our evolution to a world model of modern multiculturalism, it is not universally popular to resurrect relics of our british colonial past but to avoid or dodge opportunities presented by the purchase of the site where toronto began as a british outpost would be a tragic denial of history, and a great loss for future generations
let think big
the site should be developed as a cornerstone of ontario success as a multicultural society, and an aid to educating all ontarians - old-timers and newcomers - about where we came from and how we got to this point in our development
no doubt an initial and logical proposal will call for the faithful recreation of the original wooden structure that was built in  and razed by the americans during the war of , and levelled again by fire a decade later
visitors would be provided a taste of the fledgling province that would one day grow into an economic powerhouse of st century canada but that alone would fall far short of becoming the keystone heritage site it deserves to be, where citizens, scholars and visitors from other lands could experience our remarkable transformation over two centuries from colonial upper canada to modern ontario
a master plan is needed to develop and promote the first parliament site as a gateway to ontario, highlighting past, present and future more land will be needed to accommodate bolder visions than simple building reconstruction - only two-thirds of the original site is now in public ownership - but that necessary investment should not cow planners if ontario is to seize this opportunity to celebrate and share its heritage
the suggestion that the ontario archives - long wanting and requiring proper facilities to preserve the province documented history - be located on or near the site could be an integral component of any master plan the reconstructed first parliament building could serve as a compelling attraction to a learning centre anchored by the archives
why not build an adjoining mock legislative chamber where student parliaments could be staged, and where ontario ceremonial throne speeches could be delivered by the lieutenant-governor rather than at queen park? why not construct a photo and art gallery and seek release of elizabeth simcoe sketches of early upper canada from britain for permanent display?
toronto has a vested interest in the ambitious development of the site here, both law and religious freedom found a home after upper canada first lieutenant governor, john graves simcoe, moved the capital from its original location at newark (niagara-on-the-lake, vulnerable to american attack) in  along with expanding the distillery district, the site offers a critical mass with immense tourist potential a heritage walk could link the site with st james cathedral, st lawrence hall and other important downtown historic locales
but the site is a truly provincial treasure cities such as kingston, niagara-on-the-lake, london, amherstburg, ottawa, sault ste marie and thunder bay have played key roles in ontario past and deserve on-site attention planners might also want to highlight a link to the white house in washington, which gained its name after paint was applied to cover up the scorches of a retaliatory burning by british troops
an old colleague and buddy, merle (ting) tingley of the london free press, had a concept that could invigorate an expanded vision it was to construct ontario in miniature, to enable people to take a quick stroll along replicated highways to gain a true understanding of ontario awesome enormity, diversity and beauty
walk down highway  and through the lush agricultural land of southwestern ontario there lake erie and the meandering shores of lake st clair and lake huron cut through the niagara escarpment that mist down there is from the falls, and up ahead pokes the cn tower and the sprawl of greater toronto freighters negotiate the mighty st lawrence seaway, while the peace tower attracts the eye to ottawa and the valley hike up highway  or yonge st into cottage country and beyond
ontario has moved far beyond the narrow colonial vision of john graves simcoe a city-province working group should be established to shape a master plan that will reflect the realities of modern ontario and its multicultural makeup the site, however, should also celebrate the foundations upon which the province has prospered
it was simcoe, after all, who initiated the abolition of slavery and helped establish ontario as a haven at the end of what became the underground railroad ontario has been a haven and home for millions of us immigrants and descendents for more than two centuries
the first parliament site should reflect that

The U.N. defines a refugee as someone outside his or her country of origin with a """"well-founded fear of persecution"""" on grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinions. * There is a danger that some would-be refugees would be sent back into perilous situations. Canada does not deport refugee claimants to countries with poor human rights records, but it will return them to stopover points in Europe or the United States, where they already gained refugee status. This could result in their expulsion to their homeland.","ottawa - for , refugee claimants living in chilly basement apartments or bunking in with struggling relatives, christmas will bring but a brief respite from the misery of their daily lives
they wake up each morning, wondering if - and when - they will be expelled they have no jobs, no security and little money only blind hope sustains them
theirs is a heart-rending plight, particularly in this season of families and fellowship the churches, human rights organizations and immigration lawyers have called on the government to loosen up the normal admission rules and let them start a new life in canada
but there is another, less visible, side to this sad christmas tale
in thousands of homes across the country, immigrant families suffer a quiet sadness many have been waiting years for a missing brother, aunt or parent to be allowed into the country and still, there are empty chairs at the table
these immigrants have played by the rules they have filed applications to bring their relatives into the country, done all the necessary paperwork and faced interminable delays and disappointments
they long for a christmas when their families will be re-united
it is immigration minister barbara mcdougall's lot to decide which of these two groups deserves more of the nation's compassion
the politically popular answer would be to choose the would-be refugees
they are here, they are costing the country $ million a year in welfare payments and their plight has been highlighted by the media
declaring an amnesty would be a fine humanitarian gesture it would also be a quick way to clear up the mountain of unprocessed refugee claims that has piled up over the last two years
other immigration ministers have done it mcdougall's predecessor, walter mclean, launched an """"administrative review"""" in , allowing most refugee claimants to remain in the country after a cursory review of their case
but there are two drawbacks to this approach:
one is that it rewards pushiness many of the aspiring refugees are not innocent waifs they came, thinking they could exploit canada's generous, but inefficient, refugee admission system
at least , of the current claimants do not qualify for refugee status, under the united nations convention, according to a recent cabinet study the un defines a refugee as someone outside his or her country of origin with a """"well-founded fear of persecution"""" on grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinions
many of canada's recent arrivals were in no danger in their homeland they simply wanted a better life
to be sure, some of these would-be refugees were duped into coming by unscrupulous dream-merchants and others probably knew so little about immigration procedures when they set out, that they had no idea they wouldn't meet canada's entry criteria
but the fact remains that, knowingly or not, they abused the system
the second problem with letting them stay is that it would be a slap-in-the-face to all those who are following proper immigration procedures
how can the government expect new canadians to go on waiting patiently for their relatives, when foreigners who barge their way in are allowed to stay? how can ottawa demand respect for the rules, when it is clear that the way to get ahead is to ignore them?
a christmas amnesty would be gratifying but it could have long- term costs
mcdougall's other option would be to let the government work its way laboriously through the backlog of refugee claims
the task would fall to the new immigration and refugee board, which opens its doors on jan  the agency was created by parliament, last summer, to bring some order to canada's immigration and refugee admission system
this would impose an enormous burden on the new board, which will have to process  refugee cases a day, just to keep up to the current inflow but chairman gordon fairweather says the agency could handle the backlog, provided the government increased its budget and allowed him to hire a team of temporary officers
by taking this course, mcdougall would at least ensure that all refugee claimants get the same treatment, no matter when they arrived, and those who are exploiting the system get caught
but this approach, too, has its drawbacks:
* the backlog would linger for months, giving the opposition parties ammunition to attack the government in the house of commons and leaving the government open to criticism in the press and the charitable sector;
* the rigorous application of the law would result in thousands of expulsions, making the minister appear heartless and the country look inhospitable;
* there is a danger that some would-be refugees would be sent back into perilous situations canada does not deport refugee claimants to countries with poor human rights records, but it will return them to stopover points in europe or the united states, where they already gained refugee status this could result in their expulsion to their homeland
there is no easy way out of this predicament
obviously, canada needs a refugee system that balances fairness with generosity; an immigration system that allows newcomers to re- assemble their families without delays and frustration and a national consensus on how many newcomers should be accepted into the country each year
but none of that is going to happen by chrismas
in the meantime, mcdougall would like to help the victims of canada's chaotic immigration system
but who are its real victims: those who arrive and ask to stay, or those who quietly wait their turn?",Toronto Star,1988-12-15,1988,12,15

while north american salads are usually based on lettuce and tomatoes, arab salads combine vegetables and spices they are never monotonous, for they can be altered in many ways, and can be eaten as appetizers, entrees or accompaniments to main courses
middle eastern salads are made nourishing and delicious with a number of ingredients not well known in north america, including bulgur (a grain), lentils, pomegranate syrup (a delicious sour- sweet food enhancer), sumac (a sour, powdered spice) and tahini (sesame seed paste)
parsley, usually only used for decorative purposes in western cooking, is truly a king in the preparation of middle eastern salads
tabbouleh, safsoof and fattoush - common salads in the eastern arab countries - all use parsley as a main ingredient finely chopped and combined with other vegetables and generous amounts of seasonings, parsley turn salads into gourmet delights
some decades back, a neighbour, observing a section of my garden flourishing with parsley, asked """"what are you going to do with all this parsley? you have no animals to feed!""""
""""we are the animals!"""" i replied with a grin, thinking to myself """"if you only knew the delightful taste of this green in salads!""""
middle eastern salads favour ingredients such as lemon juice, olive oil and pomegranate syrup garlic, cilantro leaves, mint and parsley are the most popular herbs
cayenne, cumin, pepper and sumac are the prominent spices
onions, olives and pine or other nuts may be added for zest
chickpea and broad or fava beans, along with bulgur and lentils, are nourishing in salads
tasty middle eastern salads, with a history going back to early egyptian and mesopotamian civilizations, show up today on many health-conscious restaurant menus across europe and north america
since these ancient times, new salads have constantly been developed and added to the tried and true ones however, the ancient versions continue to be the favourites
during my childhood in western canada, my mother would prepare one or another type of middle eastern salad each day in the summer
these green dishes were always delectable and full of flavour, and it didn't dawn on me until later in life that they were also some of the most nourishing dishes in the world
in the ensuing years, i often prepared these salads for colleagues and friends of different backgrounds and told them of their healthful qualities
here in the west, to diversify the taste of salads, dressings like caesar, french, italian and thousand island were developed
but in the middle east and north africa, the ancient dressing of lemon juice and olive oil has stood the test of centuries
now, in most restaurants and in many homes in north america, a version of this arab dressing can be found alongside traditional western dressings, the only difference being that vinegar and vegetable oil are substituted
middle eastern cooks, at times, substitute vinegar for lemon juice, but never vegetable for olive oil
the peoples of these arab countries love the taste of the oil produced from the fruit of the olive tree
the salads that follow, which are full of healthy raw vegetables, can become part of the north american's daily menu
once tried, they are hardly ever rejected - a tribute to their lasting qualities

Thus, if you wish to remain in the U.S. for eight months, you may ask for a two-month extension. It's best to ask for an extension at about the middle of the fourth month there. The application is made at an office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. You may have no trouble getting an extension but don't expect to make it an annual eight-month stay in the U.S. Each time you enter the U.S. it's for a fresh six-month stay. However, don't make a mockery of U.S. immigration law by returning to Canada for one day - and back to your Florida condo the next day. Immigration authorities are likely to take action against you because you'd be virtually living in the U.S. all year and may no longer be considered a """"visitor"""" to the United States. My father was a race horse owner and trainer who became a U.S. citizen in 1953. He has passed away and I was wondering if I could claim U.S. citizenship. If so, would that make my husband a U.S. citizen also? You're a U.S. citizen if your father embraced American citizenship before you were born. Your husband wouldn't have a claim to U.S. citizenship. But should you wish to move to the U.S. you may readily sponsor him.","i sponsored my husband from within canada in may but he has yet to obtain a work permit we're told it's because of the large number of applications and yet, we were required to pay a $ sponsorship fee and an additional $ for the work permit application they wasted no time cashing those money orders
we're told we can expect a two-year wait for my husband to be granted permanent resident status these high fees are supposed to cover the cost of immigration services but hey, where's the service?
work permits are granted at the time """"approval in principle"""" is given to a sponsorship application such approval is currently being given within four months of an application your husband should soon have his permit
you're right to criticize immigration fees were introduced in , yet immigration services remain tangled with backlogs and bureaucratic red tape
i sponsored my husband and submitted the application for the work permit two months ago but the immigration officer won't issue a work permit until my husband comes up with a job offer yet, in a recent column you said the application for a work permit may be made at the time of the application please clarify
true the application for a work permit may be made at the time of the sponsorship application a job offer is not required restrictions on the kind of employment may apply for health reasons, but normally he would be free to take any job offered to him indeed, your husband will be granted an """"open"""" work permit
however, as immigration's wendy bontinen observed, a work permit won't be considered until """"approval in principle"""" for sponsorship has been given thus, immigration's demand for a job offer likely relates to an application he may have submitted prior to your marriage and subsequent sponsorship if that's not the case, talk to a supervisor
can the visa office refuse to recognize a marriage in india only because the marriage was not in accordance with traditional hindu customs?
no a wedding ceremony in india recognized by the india government normally is equally recognized for immigration purposes there are exceptions, as in the case of a """"marriage of convenience"""" designed to get someone to canada who otherwise wouldn't qualify for an immigrant visa the visa office may have other reasons the sponsor would be told the reason

there are no changes visitors to the us are automatically admitted for a six-month period extensions may be granted thus, if you wish to remain in the us for eight months, you may ask for a two-month extension it's best to ask for an extension at about the middle of the fourth month there the application is made at an office of the us immigration and naturalization service you may have no trouble getting an extension but don't expect to make it an annual eight-month stay in the us each time you enter the us it's for a fresh six-month stay however, don't make a mockery of us immigration law by returning to canada for one day - and back to your florida condo the next day immigration authorities are likely to take action against you because you'd be virtually living in the us all year and may no longer be considered a """"visitor"""" to the united states
i moved to the united states in  and subsequently relinquished my canadian citizenship when i took american citizenship in october, , i sought to return to canada but i was caught in immigration red tape for years in those years you came to my assistance twice in june i became a canadian citizen again, only because of your column in the star and your intervention words cannot express my gratitude thank you sounds so insignificant, but thank you

what is the rule on notifying ohip of extended stays outside ontario their seniors' bulletin says you should does this mean you must?
no there's no law requiring such notice however, it's a good idea to alert ohip authorities when going abroad for more than  days it removes the risk of delays in collecting for medical expenses incurred outside ontario after months abroad when advance notice isn't given, health authorities may want to make sure the claimant had remained a resident of ontario

if neil bissoondath has seen and approved the phrase in his biographical note, that """"he is part of a very literary family, his mother being the sister of both vs naipaul and the late shiva naipaul """"; and if he has not seen the burden of irony in this literary association with family, then i feel that i am justified in saying, after reading the worlds within her, that bissoondath is truly connected to vidia naipaul not only by blood, but by a clear and clever testiness with black people
we have read bissoondath's views about multiculturalism he is some kind of a hero for his """"rightist"""" point of view and he has said in his work of non-fiction lost illusions that cultural antecedents are too burdensome to be used in a contemporary definition of oneself or one's ethnicity
but to get back to his fiction 
this novel is the story of yasmin, who travels from the canadian city she has lived in for years to return her mother's ashes to the caribbean there she meets her uncle cyril, aunt penny and the maid amina she also discovers larger truths about her past, her parents and their indian background, and their island's struggle for political independence
in this novel, the metaphor for black people is birds  animals this is a small but defining aspect of the novelist's animus a young man, a member of an indian family in trinidad, hunting blackbirds, """"the blacker the better,"""" with a pellet gun every west indian knows that """"blackbird"""" is a code name for black people
all the characters seem to me to be irreconcilably and irredeemably negative they all want to be somewhere else, something else, somebody else
reading the novel, with its nuances and innuendoes and clever usage of metaphor (for instance """"light""""), i am faced with the shock that all the indian characters would prefer to be somebody else even when the desire is not expressed explicitly, we feel they want to be white
it is this dependency upon whiteness that expresses bissoondath's bleating request for cultural acceptance, that drives his characters' unrelenting nihilism
one gets the feeling that the mad expressions and sentiments of the disoriented shakti, yasmin's putative mother, reveal her willingness to trample upon all aspects of indian heritage, and reorder herself -- her mind, her personality, her character -- as an englishwoman, brittle as a china teacup and saucer in the ritual of drinking tea, precisely at the same hour each day
we west indians have been lovers of english society and its idiosyncrasies, not the least of which are barbadians referring to themselves as """"little england"""" but we have not reached the stage of national madness portrayed in this novel by the politician's wife, who seems to find nothing redeemable in her native society
she might very well not have considered trinidad her native land, nor have felt that india, that distant place, is the locus of her origin and culture
how close is bissoondath's association here to the great uncle? naipaul said once that while in oxford, having left his gas heater on, the consequent warmth of his room reminded him of trinidad, a place that produced nothing; that had no culture we are faced, in the worlds within her, with the same contention of dismissal
i wonder what then is the mental attitude of a novelist from that land of such enduring beauty, both physical and intellectual -- even if not politically and intellectually acceptable (but this does not erase it, for it exists!) -- what is wrong with the """"temperriment"""" of a novelist who, in , is living as a west indian immigrant (or an indo-caribbean man) in canada, to make him choose this political point of self-abnegation in writing this novel? what is his intellectual intention?
the novel has sections of writing that grab at the heart bissoondath's skill is not in question here bissoondath is no fool i want to say that the structure, having the story flow from two different origins to meet in the centre, in the vortex, is worthy of comment
the admission that yasmin's mother is not shakti but the maid, raped by the politician, her """"father,"""" shakti's husband, is peculiarly west indian, and middle class and the sections dealing with yasmin's confusion about marriage, life, motherhood, her place in canada as a """"brown"""" and as a television journalist, show that bissoondath is certainly not without the gifts of the novelist
why, then, this insistence upon racial divisions, described not as a characteristic of the trinidad landscape, but as bare pamphleteering?

students, teachers, activists and professors held a news conference yesterday at queen park to support the controversial proposal adopted last week by the toronto district school board they stressed that the school will not be exclusively for black students and teachers, and will enrich, not bypass, the ontario curriculum

""""our community is not strongly divided on this issue - our community is united,"""" galabuzi added, """"although there are some who disagree, but that not unlike any other community""""
mcguinty has said he is disappointed toronto trustees have chosen to launch an africentric alternative school as a way to battle a  per cent dropout rate among black students
he says he favours keeping students of all backgrounds together in public schools
but galabuzi noted canada charter of rights and freedoms and the ontario human rights code allow programs to be offered to specific groups, including racial groups, if they are meant to help compensate for a disadvantage
""""equal treatment does not mean same treatment sometimes you have to do things differently for some groups to ensure equitable outcomes,"""" said galabuzi

their purpose is to establish the distance between angles and points the measurements, begun in the th century, became the basis for charting the coast, setting longitude and latitude, and the broader map-making of an expanding nation
these discs set a standard, or rule of thumb, that was uniformly accepted scientifically, they provided a common ground, a place to start lyrically, they offer something closer to the words on a weather-beaten historical plaque that celebrates a past offering """"a sense of orientation to the american people""""
the one big argument against naming judge amy coney barrett to the supreme court is that she threatens deep-seated principles in her conservatism, rooted in her catholicism, critics say she will weaken or undo (with her like-minded jurists) long-standing markers of american life these include the right to abortion, the legitimacy of same-sex marriage, the accountability of corporate america it means challenging voting rights and labour rights most imminently, it means overturning access to health care
senate democrats have focused on the danger to the affordable care act, which will be argued before the supreme court next month their message: appoint her, and it's over for obamacare
what is striking in this discussion - and the larger one bedevilling a polarized america - is the enduring inclination to revisit contentious issues, years later, to re-litigate them in america, some issues never seem settled, particularly abortion and health care
the supreme court protected a woman's right to choose in roe v wade in  but the religious right opposes it critics have waged a relentless campaign to overturn the ruling barrett's vote could do it
congress passed the affordable care act in  the supreme court upheld it in  undeterred, the republicans have repeatedly tried to repeal it, failing by just one vote in 
the new challenge the court will hear was once called preposterous; now it isn't nothing really leaves the country's ideological battlefield, from which losers retreat but never yield they simply carry on
health care was addressed a decade ago, abortion almost a half-century ago no matter in both cases, a loud conservative minority, backed by private money, worked to end both
the hard right has assailed voting rights, campaign financing, the status of immigrants and refugees dismantling restraints on the free market - licensing requirements, trade barriers, health and safety rules, corporate taxes - has been a passion of the libertarian plutocrat charles koch for decades
donald trump has rescinded industrial clean-air standards and automotive emissions rules, and withdrawn protection for lands his predecessor designated national monuments the ban on oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge has been lifted
a new conservative majority on the court will support less regulation, as well as striking down obamacare and restricting abortion it will remain an existential threat to any progressive program, as it was to the new deal in frustration, fdr tried to expand the court, and joe biden's democrats may do the same
this refusal to accept precedent is a recurring theme in american history, which is full of rejectionists the deep south never accepted its loss in the civil war the consequence was a century of segregation and a legacy of institutional racism
canada lacks the imagination and ambition of america, but it is more moderate when it adopted universal health care, liberalized immigration, abolished capital punishment and accepted same-sex marriage and abortion, there was a general acceptance
here, things are different
there, there's a distrust of government, a skepticism of science, a belief in personal freedom, the influence of religion, and rule by minority in an antiquated electoral system all wage war on precedent things are open to interpretation
nothing is fixed in this national conversation, there are no markers set in rocks along political trails america needs a sense of consensus, but ideology, faith, self-interest and politics deny it andrew cohen is a journalist, professor and author of two days in june: john f kennedy and the  hours that made history",The Ottawa Citizen,2020-10-14,2020,10,14

""""we must find ways where we can develop our young drivers, to take our sport into the future"""" legault had said, adding that the current setup - in which just about every automobile manufacturer out there has its own series - just isn't working
said abrahamson """"i've got just the plan i haven't talked to anyone about it but i think it's workable and worth pursuing it's patterned on the concept for a racing series that was developed by a friend of mine in britain""""
in a nutshell, an open-wheel, single-seat formula car designed and built here in canada would be powered by v engines manufactured by any of the major motor companies
""""our engine formula would be open,"""" abrahamson said """"today, everything is pigeonholed atlantic is toyota, bmw is bmw and so on so in this new series, you could use any v engine -  litres, or whatever - made by anybody that way, you could have some real competition among the engine manufacturers""""
here's where the cfl comes in
""""we have something in this country that is uniquely canadian the canadian football league i would like to see each one of the nine teams in the cfl have a two-car racing team operating under its umbrella the series would then be made up of nine races; each football team would have a """"home"""" race built around a particular home game
""""so, say the argonauts home race is going to be at mosport international raceway part of the price paid for a ticket to a particular football game - this could be negotiated - would go to the racing team everybody at the football game would then be invited to attend the race their football ticket would get them into mosport
""""the cars would be painted in the team colours and if people wanted, they could wear their team's colours there would be a television package the potential for cross-marketing between the engine manufacturers, the football teams and the racing venues is enormous""""
abrahamson says he's been dreaming about this for two years
""""the key is that every single driver in this series has to be a canadian citizen or a landed immigrant you can't be anything else same with the team members we want to develop canadian talent, not only from a driving point of view but an engineering point of view and a mechanical point of view""""
abrahamson says that while legault has thrown down the gauntlet, it's going to take a person like legault to get something like this off the ground
""""if he was to say, 'okay, the montreal alouettes home race will be part of the canadian grand prix weekend and we will market it accordingly,' then things would start to happen a lot of stuff would come into play because legault is legault he's a pretty influential guy""""
abrahamson cautions that this scenario is just that a concept maybe it won't fly, but he thinks it - or something like it - will
""""i'm a great believer in canada, and i'm a great believer in what we can do as a people,"""" he said
""""if you look at us, we are known in the world for two things ice hockey and motor racing and it's not oval racing, either we are known for road racing the villeneuves, tracy - you can go down the line
""""we're not known for tiddly winks we don't play international soccer well we do hockey and racing well i won't get into the hockey thing, but when it comes to motor racing, we have done what we do with a lot of things in this country we've given up just about everything to either the americans or the brits
""""i honestly believe that we can create our own motorsport industry, our own technical centre, our own engineers, our own people who will be able to perform firstly at home and then we can export them accordingly, just like we do our drivers""""
he plans to talk to legault about this and to the canadian football league
the finish line some of racing's old campaigners have passed away in recent days - werner gudzus, ernie de vos and ralph wissing
werner gudzus was a young tiger in the early days of mosport he was known as a very quick sedan driver, initially in his own volvos and later in beach auto-sponsored bmws
in the 's, he had a lock for several years on the british auto racing club's stirling moss award, which is awarded each year to the driver deemed barc's most successful on the national or international stage
werner won it four straight years, from  through  he won the ontario region touring car championship in , driving a lotus cortina
said one of his arch rivals, horst kroll """"he was a very hard racer but a very good racer and he was a fair racer - not like some of the guys who raced at that time""""
werner died on march  at the age of  he leaves his wife siggy, a son, stepson and grandson
ernie de vos started racing in a formula junior at the old st eugene airport circuit in quebec he purchased a brabham fj from sir jack himself in the early s and won races with it in canada and the united states he also had success driving a lola
he was in against some tough company in those early years one formula junior race at mosport in , in which he finished second, was won by a young peter revson
ernie pretty much quit racing after the formula junior years and took up serious cycling he rode a recumbent bicycle from vancouver to his home in bolton, ont, in 
ernie was killed march  while cycling on a highway in florida he was  he leaves his wife jane, three children and two stepchildren
ralph wissing was nearly  when he died in buffalo in january
for many years, his burst machine shop-sponsored supermodifieds appeared in races sanctioned by the international supermodified association
a fellow who liked to talk about golf almost as much as he did about racing, ralph loved to tell stories - many about himself one of his favourites involved the curly fries we sometimes eat in restaurants
ralph claimed to have invented the machine that made curly fries he figured he'd make a million bucks selling those machines to restaurants so a guy called him up one day and ordered  of them
ralph worked night and day building those machines he filled the order and then his business dried up
why?
because the guy who bought the  machines started cooking like crazy and freezing the curly fries he was producing and selling them to the same restaurants ralph figured would be lining up to buy his brainwave ralph laughed as hard as anybody at his """"miss-fortune""""
ralph leaves his wife, four children and nine grandchildren

437175020,Let's make multiculturalism work:   [Final Edition ],"Is there a future for multicultural Canada? Has novelist Neil Bissoondath, through his latest book, Selling Illusions: The Cult Of Multiculturalism In Canada, driven the last nail on the coffin of multiculturalism? How does one become an un-hyphenated Canadian? Were there unhyphenated Canadians before multiculturalism was introduced as official policy in 1971? The founding ethnic groups in Canada, the Inuits and the Indians, were hyphenated since they belonged to different groups or nations. When the Europeans came, they brought their specific hyphens, too - French and then English, followed by everyone else. Until 1971 biculturalism was acceptable to most. It was felt those who were neither French nor English did not bring anything worthwhile with them. Their culture was looked down on. They were forced to ``assimilate'' into the French or British culture. If Bissoondath has his way, would he be able to persuade Quebecers that they should just be Canadians and not French Canadians? Is it realistic to ask them to do so?","is there a future for multicultural canada? has novelist neil bissoondath, through his latest book, selling illusions: the cult of multiculturalism in canada, driven the last nail on the coffin of multiculturalism?
there are many canadians including minorities who support bissoondath quite understandably, they just want to be canadians, unhyphenated, with all the rights, responsibilities and privileges they want a canada where no one is assigned his or her place according to ethnicity that is what it should be in an ideal world
unfortunately, the world is far from ideal many minority group members think that if they can somehow eliminate the burden of the hyphen they become equal to everyone else what an illusion!
how does one become an un-hyphenated canadian? were there unhyphenated canadians before multiculturalism was introduced as official policy in ? the founding ethnic groups in canada, the inuits and the indians, were hyphenated since they belonged to different groups or nations when the europeans came, they brought their specific hyphens, too - french and then english, followed by everyone else
until  biculturalism was acceptable to most it was felt those who were neither french nor english did not bring anything worthwhile with them their culture was looked down on they were forced to ``assimilate'' into the french or british culture if bissoondath has his way, would he be able to persuade quebecers that they should just be canadians and not french canadians? is it realistic to ask them to do so?
bissoondath's illustrations on multiculturalism are based on the assumption that the $ million spent on it ( cents per capita) by the canadian government is all blown on song and dance this is utter ignorance the amount spent on cultural events was relatively high in the 's and early 's now the bulk of the money is spent on race relations
canadian society is peaceful and harmonious, partly due to that expenditure we stick to the old adage: prevention is better than cure when the most senior level of government works for racial harmony and funds municipalities, advocacy groups, universities, schools, hospitals, other non-governmental organizations and businesses to promote racial harmony and employment equity, the provincial governments often follow the lead provinces like ontario spend a significant amount promoting racial harmony and employment equity
another assumption a lot of anti-multiculturalism proponents have is that in the us there is no multiculturalism and, therefore, americans have a strong national identity, while we have only divided ethnic identity
however, multiculturalism is as strong in the us as it is here, though it is not official americans have a melting pot that did not melt after generations, several ethnic groups have maintained their culture blacks never got a chance to go anywhere near the unmelting pot, and so have discovered the hyphen and call themselves afro-americans
the stand taken by bissoondath has become popular with some british and french diehards who always thought that their culture is superior to everyone else's
they were waiting for a black, brown or yellow messiah to declare the unholiness of multiculturalism they are the ones cheering on bissoondath and his ill-informed ``theory''
canadian politics has further befuddled the situation the progressive conservatives and the ndp, both supporters of multiculturalism and racial equality, have almost disappeared from the scene two regional parties have come in their place
the reform, despite occasional pronouncements that it is not racist, harbors many racists in its bosom and is openly against multiculturalism and anti-racism programs on the grounds of costs witness its opposition to the implementation of the long-delayed and much- needed establishment of the race relations foundation by the federal government
the opposition, bloc quebecois, has not been bursting with enthusiasm for multiculturalism or anti-racism policies since its focus is separation from canada in which the pur laine (pure wool) quebecers are dominant nor does it find many ethnic or racial minorities (impure wool?) in quebec supporting its cause
what is the way out? this is the time for strategic thinking and development of policies that are appropriate to the times realizing that we are in a world that is becoming more global, competitive, information-based and driven by technology multiculturalism is an asset and not a liability if properly developed, directed and used what is the role of multiculturalism in a changing world?
some specifics: all canadians were pleased to see team canada doing so well in asia, signing billions of dollars worth of contracts that will bring jobs to canadians was our multiculturalism policy partly responsible for the huge success of this trade mission?
the next investment and trade frontier is south asia according to the globe and mail, india was among the six most favorite nations for investment last year for the us soon canada will follow the us lead, and guess who will be the main contact persons?
we have half a million people of south asian origin in canada doing very well, thanks to multiculturalism that makes them feel worthwhile
what about immigration? we want more educated and wealthy immigrants to come to canada we do not take anymore the ``wretched refuse'' (to quote from the statue of liberty) are they going to embrace wholeheartedly the british and french culture in canada or would they want to maintain some of their culture and traditions? the ``wretched refuse'' would have happily embraced biculturalism, lock, stock and barrel
no culture is perfect, just as no human being is perfect what multiculturalism can do is to combine the good elements - the food, the arts, and so on - of each culture to shape a society that would be better and richer in this sense, can we afford not to have multiculturalism?
on the other hand, let us stop collecting information on ethnicity the reporting of ethnicity was maintained by statistics canada mainly to please french canada but with the anticipated dwindling of nationalism in quebec, hopefully there will be less demand for such numbers
another source of demand for such statistics is employment equity policies if minorities become more accepted in canadian society, in an ideal world, employment equity policies in the long run will become superfluous then why collect ethnicity data spending millions of dollars no one would know how many people of what origin live in canada
is it just as illusory as the approach of bissoondath himself? we need to open up some of these issues
t john samuel was director of race relations in the former department of secretary of state and a school board trustee currently he is a research professor at carleton university, ottawa and runs a consulting firm, john samuel & associates inc he is the author of quebec nationalism is dead

and among  million others, the not-yet famous: a future president of general motors, an eight-year-old boy who would become a justice of the us supreme court, labor leaders, concert pianists, artists, seamstresses, scientists, laborers
there were future canadians cape bretoner lucille gardner grandmother, julia menoskey poger, of austro-hungary, landed on ellis island after emigrating in  to join a husband in the coalfields of pennsylvania
'he was an amazing woman, a midwife who walked across the hills to deliver babies and strong and clever enough to move her family out of the coal mines,'' says gardner today
when gary kerhoulas -year-old father came in , ''he had only $ with him and the immigration people said he needed $ so they held him for six days before he could join an uncle in toronto''
kerhoulas, a london, ont, high school teacher, says his father, a father-in-law and a grandfather all passed through ellis island after emigrating from greece

today, more than  million north americans can trace their families back to at least one ancestor who passed through this leading official entry point to the new world, mostly between  and  tens of thousands of them went on to rail connections northward, the cheapest way to reach canada
tracing the last stage of olinto calamai pilgrimage through the choppy cobalt waters of new york harbor and through the island elegant main reception building, dating from , is simultaneously a wrenching and comforting experience
thousands of tourists will do it when the island in new york harbor opens as a museum next year after a $-million restoration project as many as , names will be inscribed on an immigrant wall of honor
to see in person the cavernous registry room _ almost always called the great hall _ means being confronted by stories of scowling inspectors, mysterious letters pinned to coats, cold-handed doctors, unfamiliar food, endless lines
and yet  the great hall rises to an awe-inspiring vaulted ceiling of restored and sparkling guastavino tiles, the windows look out to the beckoning statue of liberty, the dormitories show concern for sanitation and nearby offices reveal that even the daughters of the american revolution were on hand to help
''this is the most important shrine in the united states,'' says august bolino, a professor at catholic university in washington, dc ''people want to know about their grandparents i had never seen my grandparents yet i wanted to know who these people were''
bubbling with infectious enthusiasm, museum specialist diana pardue points out the stairs of separation _ so called because immigrants accepted went down one side, rejected down another
''we've found that most immigrants' experience wasn't that bad fewer that two per cent were actually turned away and people names weren't changed here that much either we're trying to correct all these misconceptions''
yet they are also trying to be truthful, so the displays will discuss the ''forced migration'' of slaves, the displacement of indians, the backlash against orientals and contract laborers and the gradually closing door that made ellis island all but superfluous by

the amplified voices in your ears, however, will be real: the -year-old remembering from the eyes of a -year-old, the anxiety of russian jews fleeing persecution, the hands feeling coins sewn into coat linings, the young woman from tuscany scanning the crowd for a brother, an uncle, a husband-to-be
''it more than just some place your ancestors came,'' says the park service gary roth ''it a symbol of the united states''
abandoned as an immigration station in , the -building complex here was allowed to decay thieves filched the copper from the four domes on the main building that provided the first glitter in america to many new arrivals water poured in through gaping windows and leaking roofs to loosen tiles and crumble plaster no buyer was willing to pay even $ million for an entire island lying just off the largest city in the us

1563990480,Working through the stages of culture shock,"The stages of culture shock were first charted 60 years ago by Canadian anthropologist Kalervo Oberg and described in a speech he gave to the Women's Club of Rio de Janeiro. Oberg's description of symptoms included """"excessive washing of hands"""" and """"a feeling of helplessness.""""","  i am in culture shock
this is not just a cliche it's a psychological state, studied by academics around the world
it is broken into five stages i am in stage  my symptoms: anxiety, low spirits, general malaise for my host country, which coincidentally is my home country, canada
complaining is another symptom of stage  culture shock but, when dressed up as sharing, it's also considered a healthy healing mechanism
so i went to the immigrant welcome centre in a strip mall off of hwy  in vaughan to find some people who might understand what i'm going through
russian immigrant vera lipkin counselled me to focus on others """"when you help other people, then you understand who you are in the world,"""" she said
she's been in canada for three years she's in stage 
syrian native rose khoshaba considers herself cured but she spent her first four months in canada barricaded in her house her antidote? """"i got pregnant,"""" she says """"my babies filled me with joy""""
the stages of culture shock were first charted  years ago by canadian anthropologist kalervo oberg and described in a speech he gave to the women's club of rio de janeiro they were later published in the journal practical anthropology
they've since been widely adopted by anthropologists, sociologists, business coaches and university counsellors, although they are not considered prescriptive or linear
many of you reading this are immigrants yourself tell me, does these sound familiar? (oberg initially had only four stages)
stage : honeymoon phase you decorate your post cards with exclamation marks beautiful! fascinating! the people are so kind! according to oberg, this can last a few weeks to six months
stage : crisis you have feasted too much on your new culture, and you feel sick and sour you now consider the people to be rude, cold, lazy or untrustworthy you are desperately homesick you take refuge with fellow people from """"back home"""" oberg's description of symptoms included """"excessive washing of hands"""" and """"a feeling of helplessness""""
stage : coping you can leave your house without getting lost all day, and you've learned enough local language to engage in small talk with locals you've regained your sense of humour you give advice to greener newcomers
stage : assimilation you feel at home
""""the environment does not change,"""" oberg wrote """"what has changed is your attitude toward it""""
oberg had loads of first-hand experience he grew up in a finnish commune on an island off vancouver they named sointula, or """"place of harmony,"""" which tragically burned down when he was a toddler
he went on to get a phd in anthropology in chicago he did fieldwork in alaska and uganda later, as a development worker with the american government, he worked in peru, ecuador and brazil - all this at a time when travel was long and rare
i know all this from edward dutton, a british adjunct anthropology professor at finland's oulu university he researched oberg for his book, culture shock and multiculturalism: reclaiming a useful model from the religious realm i am reading it at night now it is my security blanket
the fifth stage was later added to oberg's model, he tells me: reverse culture shock
it happens when you return home but it contains all the four other original stages that's where i am
i spent the last year living in dakar, senegal i came home a month ago, a scrawny bear clawing out of hibernation i am hungry and frozen, while the rest of the city races by, on speed just getting my kids to school exhausts me, and then i have to go to work!
i feel lonely on the subway, where no one says hello or makes eye contact
oberg didn't say how long culture shock lasts but over skype from finland, dutton says it took him four years to feel at home there
i will say the welcome centre lifted my spirits there were language classes, job counsellors, child care, computer stations - all free for newcomers to canada our country's generosity made me proud

437258861,"Hear what we are saying Behind the Asian Heritage Month Festival and Desh Pardesh lies the message that Asian culture is ''more than saris, satay and samurai'':   [Final Edition ]","``As new Asian artists emerge, they find themselves drawn to a wonderful fusion of styles,'' says Saeed Khan, co-curator of the Asian Heritage Month Festival. * A panel on Asian stereotypes in the entertainment media designed to explore and debunk ``the numchuk- wielding, geisha-girling, exotic, submissive East Asian and the turban-wearing, religious fanatic, 15-to-a-room, curry-eating South Asian.''

(Tuesday at the Art Gallery of Ontario Jackman Hall.) It part of a program of nearly a dozen films and videos by Asian women called, pointedly, ``Laundry Women, Dragon Ladies and Other Exotic Oriental Girls.''","lurking below the surface of almost every celebration of ethnic culture is an insidious virus known as nostalgia
unchecked, it can obscure vision with a dreamy haze, starve the brain of its critical sensibility and provoke runaway palpitations for the old country, the familiar culture left behind
two festivals of asian art and politics, however, aim to keep nostalgia firmly at bay both toronto events are liberally laced with attitude, humor - and sometimes rage though sharply focused on the east, they use western themes and techniques that promise a compelling dose of sentiment without the mawkish burden of sentimentality
``as new asian artists emerge, they find themselves drawn to a wonderful fusion of styles,'' says saeed khan, co-curator of the asian heritage month festival
``many of those artists may be rooted in traditional methods, but they see great potential in experimenting with other genres our goal is to give them the exposure they deserve''
``sometimes you have to go beyond just loving and respecting your origins,'' agrees paramjit ray, a co-ordinator of the desh pardesh festival and conference of south asian culture and politics
``you have to try to determine, for instance, where today non-traditional lifestyles and roles fit into a long, rich history of culture and customs there great value in combining celebration with examination''
that why the second annual asian heritage month - through may  - combines culture, politics and diverse forms of artistry:
* a panel on asian stereotypes in the entertainment media designed to explore and debunk ``the numchuk- wielding, geisha-girling, exotic, submissive east asian and the turban-wearing, religious fanatic, -to-a-room, curry-eating south asian'' (tomorrow, at a location to be determined)
* short movies by canadian director midi onodera, ``the first asian canadian girl filmmaker on the block'' among them is displaced view, a ``part oral history, part minimalist expression'' film about onodera relationship with her mother, grandmother and japanese heritage (tuesday at the art gallery of ontario jackman hall) it part of a program of nearly a dozen films and videos by asian women called, pointedly, ``laundry women, dragon ladies and other exotic oriental girls''
* a mixed-media evening by asians of mixed racial background, including comedy (shaun mojamder), music (chiyoko szlavnics), literary readings (fred wah) and films (gitanjali) (may  at the rivoli)
* music by punjabi by nature, the east asian band that mixes bhangra pop and power funk, led by principal musicians tony singh and paul dhanjal (may  at the bamboo)
meanwhile, the fifth annual desh pardesh (hindi for ``home away from home'') looks at the political forces that affect south asian culture - sweatshops, the $ immigration fee, sexual assault, the invisibility of gay and lesbian south asians it runs from wednesday until may  and brings together writers, filmmakers, painters and musicians among the highlights:
* a film and panel discussion on south asian workers, primarily women, who have organized to oppose exploitation, low pay and sweatshop conditions in the western work force the speaker is tammy gulati, who organized a union at a limite clothing store in mississauga that since been closed down (may  in the ymca mainspace)
* an open forum, featuring activists from canada and the us, on issues affecting south asians living with hiv or aids (may  at  church st)
* screening of narmada: a valley rises, a feature-length documentary on the successful attempt in  to prevent construction of india narmada valley dam and the relocation of , people it followed by a discussion on the role south asians who live in the west play in opposing harmful development projects in the third world (may  in the ymca mainspace)
* a panel on south asians with disabilities, with special emphasis on how longstanding asian customs and beliefs sometimes fail to deal with disabilities as effectively as mainstream canadian society does (may  at the ymca)
* ``brown skin, red ink,'' a stage program by young artists that uses writing and videos to ``break the silences around sexuality, racism, sexism, violence and identity'' (may  at ymca mainspace)
* ``shifting ground,'' a program about going from one culture to another the video ``darwish,'' for example, follows a sufi cab driver in england as he moves through the city to the sound of his own musings and the qa'awali of nusrat fateh ali khan
complete information on events, dates, times and ticket prices of the asian heritage month festival is available at - details on desh pardesh, -
part of the idea behind the festivals is the attempt to
tell mainstream canadians about the variety and richness of asian cultures for the most part, though, asians from up to  different countries are talking to one another about matters - homosexuality and aids, for example - that don't always get talked about within the various asian communities
desh pardesh has expanded over five years from a one-day event to a five-day festival that draws participants from across canada, the us, england and as far away as new zealand
why didn't it get going before ? only in the last several years have south asians - including communities from india, bangladesh, pakistan and nepal - established a firm enough footing in canada to organize these festivals, rai says
``the s and 's were a time for building the communities,'' she explains, ``and the population base wasn't as extensive as it is now
``south asians also tended to look toward india for information or entertainment so there were major concerts and other cultural events at places like maple leaf gardens, but nothing like the programs we're developing in the 's''
during the years of immigration, two types of artists tended to emerge - those who became known exclusively within their communities, and those who adopted some western techniques and got exposure only in the mainstream arts scene, saeed khan says
``so we had the unusual situation where, in order to preserve cultural authenticity, some artists become culturally ultra-conservative and the only alternative was outright assimilation into the mainstream
``what strange is that you don't see this kind of radical split in asia for instance, there a huge south asian community in hong kong, but it able to preserve its identity without becoming totally segregated
``the fact is, society is always in flux, so artists don't have to be obsessed with preserving styles and traditions that change naturally over time anyway
``just look at european art and philosophy what we see in the west today is only a distant echo of what was created  or  years ago there no reason why asian art can't evolve in the same way''
the festivals let the new generation of canadian-born asians know that, contrary to what their parents and grandparents might believe, art is a rewarding and legitimate occupation
``it not hard to understand why young people were discouraged from entering the arts since the 's, immigrants have been concerned mainly with keeping their families housed and fed in a stable environment art is too risky for people in those circumstances
``but the time has finally come to encourage young asians to express themselves in ways that blend new visions with the best of traditional styles
``after all, history shows that communities stay vibrant and healthy if they're open to fresh voices and new ideas and the asian community in canada is no different''

437145751,"'Rich men' favored by policy, critics say Family-class restrictions assailed:   [MET Edition ]","Speakers from several other groups, including the Canadian Auto Workers, Intercede - an association representing domestic workers - and a coalition of AIDS groups joined [Kike Roach] and Go in their condemnation of the policy change, unveiled yesterday in Ottawa by [Sergio Marchi]. Marchi said yesterday the number of business investor immigrants would increase, while the number of family-class reunifications would fall from a projected 109,000 in 1994 to 86,000 to 90,000 in 1995. Ben Trifter, chairperson of the Canadian Bar Association Ontario immigration section, said the government changes were made simply to assuage public sentiment for a crackdown on immigration.","ottawa is moving back to an immigration policy favoring """"rich, white men and europeans"""" by reducing the number of family-class immigrants allowed into canada, immigrant support groups charged yesterday
and by cutting the number of people permitted to live here under family reunification rules, the government is, in effect, practising """"apartheid-type policies,"""" kike roach, of the national action committee on the status of women, told a news conference yesterday
""""it seems as if (immigration minister) sergio marchi is marching to the drum of right-wing policies and what left, unfortunately, resonates with discrimination and racism,"""" roach said
""""the message it sends is our door is open, but it open to rich, white men it open to europeans, but not others""""
another critic condemned the move to restrict family-class immigrants for its racist implications
""""it a way of ensuring that certain immigrants don't get in,"""" avvy go of the chinese national canadian council said at the news conference, organized by the toronto coalition against racism
because most family-class immigrants tend to be of asian, african and caribbean origin, go said, ottawa latest move is a """"deliberate"""" attempt to reduce the number of visible immigrants coming from these countries
speakers from several other groups, including the canadian auto workers, intercede - an association representing domestic workers - and a coalition of aids groups joined roach and go in their condemnation of the policy change, unveiled yesterday in ottawa by marchi
the coalition has vowed to protest the new policy, starting with a demonstration on saturday at  pm outside the immigration canada office on dundas st and university ave
marchi said yesterday the number of business investor immigrants would increase, while the number of family-class reunifications would fall from a projected , in  to , to , in 
critics also described as discriminatory the new policy to favor immigrant applicants who speak english or french, as well as the requirement that bonds be posted by relatives to ensure that new immigrants will not be a strain on social services
pete bellefeuille of the canadian auto workers said that such a policy perpetuates """"scare tactics"""" that immigrants and refugees are somehow responsible for high unemployment and a breakdown in social services - despite several studies which show otherwise
ben trifter, chairperson of the canadian bar association ontario immigration section, said the government changes were made simply to assuage public sentiment for a crackdown on immigration
he said the underlying assumption that the investor class of immigrants would be less of a drain than family-class immigrants was not defensible because there is no way to measure such costs
but trifter disagreed with those who call the new policies racist, because he said the crackdown on family class in favor of business immigrant investors is """"illusory""""
the reduction in the number of immigrants is only a reflection of fewer immigration applications, trifter said
""""it business as usual they (the liberals) are appearing to score political points and be tough when in fact they haven't changed a single regulation or made it harder for people to come in,"""" trifter said
in ottawa, sunera thobani, president of the national action committee on the status of women, said proposals to require sponsors of immigrants to post bonds will trap many women in abusive relationships
""""this would have been an ideal opportunity for mr marchi to ensure that domestic workers do not live under conditions of indentured labor, as they do now,"""" thobani said
""""nac plea to mr marchi is clear - stop catering to the tastes of the reform party""""
maria shin, executive director of the canadian ethnocultural council, said the liberals have given in to racists and right-wing groups
""""the real reason why people want to limit immigration is racism,"""" shin told reporters """"there is still a prevailing mind-set in this country that real canadians are only those who are descended from british and french stock""""
shin said new limits on immigration and changes to family reunification reinforce stereotypes of immigrants
""""in this international year of the family, when canadians, including politicians, say that they are concerned about the breakdown of families and family values, this government is telling immigrant families that they do not matter and that the government will in fact be encouraging their break-up,"""" said emmanuel dick, vice-president of the ethnocultural council
however, david matas, president of the canadian council for refugees, said changes to set one over-all level for refugees instead of having limits for each of the three separate categories of refugee claimants is a good move

His winning time of 9.84 seconds still stands as the Olympic record.; Photo: Allsport / When the Olympics were revived in 1896 in Athens, Greece, after an interval of more than 1,500 years, it was no accident that the first event was the opening heat of the 100-metre dash.; Photo: The Canadian Press / The first Canadian 100-metre champion was a slender 20-year- old from Vancouver named [Percy Williams]. At the 1928 Games in Amsterdam, the virtual unknown won the final in 10.8 seconds.

Mr. Johnson subsequently tested positive for the banned steriod stanozolol and was stripped of his medal. Ironically, Mr. Lewis tested positive three times for the banned stimulant ephedrine that same year at the U.S. Olympic trials, a fact that only came to light last year.; Graphic/Diagram: (The evolution of speed, see hard copy for graphic).","olympics 
in many ways, it couldn't be simpler you're alone in your lane, flanked by your rivals the track runs straight and true there are no turns to worry about, no flailing arms and legs to avoid when the starter's pistol sounds, you just run like stink for an eyelash less than  seconds dead simple, really
but if it were really that simple, the men's  metres wouldn't be the glamour event of the olympic games if it were really that simple, lots of us would have gold baubles dangling from our necks, like donovan bailey if it were really that simple, sprinters wouldn't risk their health and court disgrace by pumping their bodies full of steroids to gain a precious few hundredths of a second
if the olympic  metres was ever just an uncomplicated footrace, it was at the first modern games in athens in , where american thomas burke defeated four rivals in a comparatively glacial  seconds and transfixed spectators with his novel crouch start
but mr burke would have finished  metres behind mr bailey, whose winning time of  seconds in atlanta a century later still stands as the olympic record mr burke knew nothing of the year- round training regimen that today's sprinters endure, nor the aerodynamic suits and meringue-light shoes they wear and he certainly could never have imagined that victory would some day mean global fame and millions of dollars in endorsements
one thing hasn't changed, though: the  metres remains the most accessible sporting event in the world as two-time gold medallist carl lewis recently told sports illustrated, the race is so popular """"because everyone can finish it, and everyone at some point has raced to see who was the fastest""""
it attracts more competitors, from more nations, than any other event it's even within the capability of some centenarians; last month, south african philip rabinowitz became the world's fastest -year-old, covering  metres in a blazing  seconds, more than five seconds faster than the previous age-group record
the race's democratic nature means that to reach the pinnacle -- to become an olympic -metre champion -- you must defeat a pool of opponents unmatched in any other sport as a result, training, technique and technology assume paramount importance thus does the simple transmute into the complex
little of this complexity is apparent to those who watch an olympic -metre final all they see is an elemental confrontation between eight sculpted men so evenly matched that they will likely cross the finish line within three-tenths of a second of one another -- less time than it takes to sneeze
it's raw speed versus raw speed, the human form in perfect motion, with the winner claiming the title of world's fastest man in one form or another, it's a contest that has enthralled us for more than , years
- - -
the ancient olympics began in greece about  bc and continued, at four-year intervals, for more than , years and in the beginning, there was the sprint in fact, there was only the sprint for the first  olympic festivals, the sole athletic contest was the stadion, a -metre dash the length of the stadium in ancient olympia other events were added only later
according to lore, koroibos, a cook from nearby elis, was the first olympic stadion champion his sole reward was a garland of olive leaves, endorsement deals being unknown at the time
while today's sprinters are disqualified after two false starts, the ancient greeks were far tougher: false starts were punished by floggings
equipment, to put it mildly, was rudimentary nike was venerated as the goddess of victory, not as the acme of athletic footwear early competitors wore loincloths but eventually, these were discarded and runners flapped through their events unencumbered by attire of any sort
there is historical dispute about the reasons for this athletic nudism some say the tradition began after orsippos of megara won a race in the altogether, establishing a jaunty tradition that endured for centuries but others say orsippos not only lost the race in question, he tripped, fell and suffered a fatal injury after his loincloth dropped to half-mast mid-race
a competing explanation suggests the athenians established the rule after one of their runners took a tumble when his shorts came adrift to prevent a similar accident, athens decreed that all men must exercise naked, which must have delighted athenian women
whatever the truth, modern sprinters have done everything short of doffing their duds to replicate the aerodynamic freedom enjoyed by their undraped forebears at this year's olympics, for example, the canadian track team -- and  others -- will wear the nike swift suit, a hooded, full-length bodysuit designed to keep them cool in the athenian heat and minimize air resistance
when the olympics were revived in  after an interval of more than , years, it was no accident that the first event was the opening heat of the -metre dash, won by francis lane of the united states in  seconds
four days later, the five finalists assumed their stances -- ranging from fully upright to mr burke's startling crouch -- and raced in lanes separated by low ropes despite his leisurely winning time, mr burke finished two metres ahead of germany's fritz hofmann, whose true athletic specialty was rope climbing mr burke went on to win the  metres, as well
four years later, the olympics were an adjunct to the paris world's fair, and very much their poor cousin fencing was listed as part of the fair's cutlery exhibit, and swimming events were held in the river seine in a considerate move, competitors were permitted to swim with the current, which produced exceptionally fast times
track events were held on an uneven grass oval in the bois de boulogne """"the thought of tearing up the park for a cinder track was an unspeakable horror paris officials wouldn't even consider,"""" writes cleve dheensaw, in olympics , his history of canada at the summer games
the adverse conditions didn't faze the sprinters despite never having run on a grass track, americans frank jarvis and john walter tewkesbury swept the top two spots mr jarvis's winning time of  seconds was a full second faster than mr burke's mark in athens -- a quantum leap that would never be duplicated at subsequent olympics
american archie hahn became the first -metre champion to defend his olympic title -- carl lewis is the only other -- when he won in st louis in  and in  in athens at a special olympics, now considered unofficial, held to mark the th anniversary of the games' revival
the victories by mr burke, mr jarvis and mr hahn established a pattern of american dominance that has persisted american sprinters have won  of the  olympic -metre finals all but two gold medallists have been from english-speaking countries
until , south african reginald walker was the only non- american to win gold he accomplished the feat in  in london, thrilling spectators gladdened to see one of their own, albeit a colonial, humble the swaggering yanks
adding to their pleasure was the third-place showing by another colonial lad, canadian bobby kerr three judges actually put mr kerr second, but the referee awarded the silver to american james rector instead mr kerr was so furious he won gold in the  metres the next day
from  to , a time of  seconds was sufficient to capture gold that changed at the  games in paris, a -metre race later immortalized, if substantially distorted, in the oscar- winning chariots of fire
the americans, led by  olympic champion charley paddock, were again favoured three years earlier, mr paddock had demolished the world record in the  metres with a clocking of  seconds, a mark that stood for  years he was a flamboyant athlete who liked to leap at the tape with his arms flung wide
but as movie buffs know, charley paddock did not win gold in paris that year instead, a longshot briton, harold abrahams, unexpectedly rose to the occasion after tying the olympic record of  seconds in the quarterfinals and semifinals, he did it again in the final, edging american jackson scholz by two feet mr paddock wound up a well-beaten fifth
mr abraham never raced well again a year later, he injured his thigh and retired but his victory was an omen the era of american dominance in the  metres at the olympics was over, at least for a time four years later in amsterdam, it was a canadian's turn in the spotlight
- - -
it's difficult to reflect on canada's record in the men's  metres without fixating on the painful memory of ben johnson's reverse alchemy -- contriving to turn gold into dross -- in seoul in  the wound in the canadian psyche may never fully heal
but an objective assessment yields a different picture by international standards, canada has been an olympic -metre powerhouse only the masterful americans and the british have produced more gold medallists in the event than we have true, only two canadians have won but that's just one fewer than the brits, and one more than the russians, germans, south africans and jamaicans
the first canadian -metre champion was a slender -year-old from vancouver named percy williams an unlikelier olympian would be hard to envision his heart damaged by a childhood bout with rheumatic fever, mr williams weighed just  pounds when he was discovered as a raw -year-old by tom granger, a track coach who somehow saw his potential
by the time he reached amsterdam in , the five-foot-six-inch mr williams had bulked up to  pounds but he was still dwarfed by one of his rivals, briton jack london, a sturdy -pounder who towered over him by  centimetres
yet as the book canada at the olympics reports, mr williams' fragile appearance was deceptive dutch doctors assessed all , olympic athletes in amsterdam, and concluded that of them all, percy williams was the only """"perfect athlete""""
to prepare his young protege for the race, mr granger had mr williams practice his starts by barrelling full tilt into a mattress he propped against his hotel room wall the unconventional tactic bore fruit in the final, when two false starts unnerved the canadian's competitors mr williams, writes cleve dheenshaw, stayed cool by telling himself, """"remember the hotel room, just remember the hotel room""""
when the gun fired for the third time, mr williams broke first and was never headed he crossed the line two feet ahead of mr london in  seconds mr granger, watching from the stands, wept with joy two days later, mr williams won the  metres, making him one of only eight men in olympic history to win the sprint double
a virtual unknown before the olympics, mr williams was now a bona fide star when he returned to his hotel a few hours after his -metre victory, he found a huge crowd had gathered, hoping to catch a glimpse of the astounding canadian sprinter mr williams, no glory hound, quietly blended in with the crowd of admirers, waiting, in effect, for himself
the scenes of adulation were wilder still when """"peerless percy,"""" as the newspapers dubbed him, returned to canada after a triumphant train trip across canada, he arrived in vancouver to a tumultuous welcome from , people a school holiday was proclaimed, and in a taste of marketing excesses to come, a resourceful vancouver firm sold """"our percy"""" chocolate bars mr williams was presented with a new blue graham-paige sports car and a $, trust account for his education
sixty-eight years would pass (skipping over ben johnson for the moment) before another canadian would stand atop the podium in the men's  metres the second winner, donovan bailey, was as different from percy williams as the canada of  was from today's multi-ethnic nation
mr bailey was born in jamaica, and didn't move to canada until he was  unlike the scrawny mr williams, he was a muscular six- footer before fully committing himself to running, he earned a diploma in economics and launched a business career by the time he was , he owned a house and a porsche
in atlanta in , mr bailey competed against the fastest field in olympic history earlier that year, ato bolton of trinidad and american dennis mitchell had each recorded times of  for the  metres, and frank fredericks of namibia had clocked a blistering  into the wind all three would run the  final in less than  seconds
but with the gold medal on the line, mr bailey was fastest of all his winning time of  seconds established a world record if it didn't entirely erase dismal memories of mr johnson at seoul eight years earlier, the sight of mr bailey taking a victory lap literally wrapped in the maple leaf flag was a powerful analgesic against that particular heartache
(mr bailey was later involved in a much-hyped -metre race with american -metre champion michael johnson at skydome in toronto aimed at settling which of them was the world fastest man the event fell flat when mr johnson pulled a muscle and didn't finish)
between mr williams in  and mr bailey in , there was less for canadians to cheer about the country's best sprinting hope was another vancouverite, harry jerome, who tied the -metre world record of  seconds flat as a -year-old at the  olympic trials in saskatoon
that raised huge expectations for the olympics that year in rome but during a semi-final race, mr jerome pulled a hamstring and was eliminated mr jerome, a high-strung and hypersensitive man, refused to defend himself against unwarranted criticism that he had folded in the clutch when he tore a leg muscle during the - metre final of the  commonwealth games in perth, australia, a nation desperate for athletic heroes wrote him off as a chronic under-achiever
but mr jerome confounded his critics by rebuilding his injured leg and winning bronze in tokyo in  he also reached the final in mexico four years later, finishing seventh behind american jim hines
that was it for canadians in the olympic  metres until a stuttering young jamaican immigrant, the aforementioned ben johnson, won bronze in  in los angeles
the rest of his story is all too familiar in seoul four years later, mr johnson ignited one of the most riotous national celebrations in canadian history by blazing to victory in an astonishing  seconds, lowering his own world record
""""when the gun go off,"""" he had promised, """"the race be over"""" it appeared he had been as good as his word, handily defeating his arch- rival, american carl lewis, who was seeking to repeat as olympic - metre champion
the jubilation lasted three days then it was brutally extinguished by the revelation that two urine samples taken from mr johnson contained stanozolol, a banned anabolic steroid mr johnson was stripped of his gold medal, which was awarded to the second- place finisher, the much-despised mr lewis
in canada, the mood was poisonous """"you bastard,"""" spat citizen columnist earl mcrae, in a vitriolic attack on mr johnson """"you make me puke""""
though mr johnson was the first sprinter -- and by far the biggest star -- to be caught using banned drugs at the olympics, athletes had long used performance-enhancing substances as far back as the -metre final in , the us sprint coach fed his three finalists a potent brew of raw egg and sherry they finished first, second and fourth it's unclear how much the unpalatable cocktail contributed to the results
once the games began full-scale drug testing in , cheaters started popping up like dandelions on an untended lawn at first, the offenders were mostly weightlifters and others in muscle sports such as the shot-put, hammer-throw and wrestling
but gradually, sprinters twigged to the extra speed that chemically enhanced muscles can produce including mr johnson, four of the top five finishers in the  olympic final -- eventual winner carl lewis, dennis mitchell and linford christie, who won the -metre gold in  -- have tested positive for banned drugs at one point or another
ironically, in light of what was to transpire in seoul, mr lewis tested positive three times for a banned stimulant, ephedrine, at the  us olympic trials, a fact that only came to light last year after a short investigation, the international association of athletic federations, track and field's governing body, ruled that the us olympic committee was right to allow mr lewis to compete because his use of the drug was """"inadvertent"""" -- a decision dick pound, head of the world anti-doping agency, has described as troubling
meanwhile, world-record-holder tim montgomery, who failed to qualify for the  metres in athens, is one of four american sprinters who have been charged with steroid use by the us anti- doping agency
increasingly, modern pharmacology appears to be an essential, if illegal, part of the elite sprinter's arsenal ben johnson may yet turn out to have been a sort of doltish trailblazer, teaching other sprinters not that it's wrong to cheat, but rather that it's dumb to get caught
mr johnson's fall from grace had an eerie echo in the star- crossed fate of other canadian olympic sprinters percy williams, uncomfortable with the adulation his olympic triumph brought, gradually became a virtual recluse on nov , , alone and in poor health, he reclined in his bathtub and killed himself with a gun
nine days later, harry jerome was crossing the lion's gate bridge in vancouver in a car when he suffered a brain aneurysm he died on route to hospital he was  his last public act had been to attend percy williams' funeral

humans have always been fascinated by speed the quest to go faster -- by land, sea or air -- helped lift us from our caves and expose new worlds so it should be no surprise that a showcase for human thoroughbreds has produced its share of drama and controversy
in the -metre final in , for instance, americans eddie tolan and ralph metcalfe both crossed the finish line in  seconds, knocking three-tenths of a second off the olympic record the winner wasn't declared until hours later, after seven judges reviewed a film of the race they determined that mr tolan had crossed the line two inches ahead of mr metcalfe, and awarded him the gold but under today's rules, mr metcalfe would have won, because he was first to reach the line
one of the most famous -metre finals occurred four years later, in berlin adolf hitler wanted the olympics to be a showcase for aryan superiority but jesse owens had other plans
mr owens, the son of alabama sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves, was the star of the  games, winning the  metres and three other events in the showcase race, mr owens defeated the luckless ralph metcalfe, who collected his second consecutive silver medal mr owens had a simple explanation for his success """"i let my feet spend as little time on the ground as possible,"""" he told a london reporter
the myth has circulated that hitler, furious at mr owens' exploits, refused to shake hands with the american athlete the story gained currency because hitler had invited three german athletes to his private box after they won their events but in fact, he had ended the practice when an olympic official told him to invite all winners to his box, or none at all
life for mr owens after the olympics was anything but glamorous after a series of business failures, he took a job as a playground instructor and raced, as """"the ebony antelope,"""" against horses, dogs and motorcycles he finally achieved financial security in the s as a public speaker for corporate sponsors
the  final in helsinki wasn't the fastest in olympic history, but it was certainly the closest four runners finished in  seconds, with the other two finalists timed in  american lindy remigino was declared the winner when the photo finish showed his right shoulder had reached the finish line a bare inch ahead of jamaican sprinter herbert mckenley's chest
after german armin hary became the first non-english-speaking winner in rome in , the stage was set for """"bullet"""" bob hayes in tokyo four years later
arguably the greatest sprinter of all time, mr hayes entered the games undefeated in  straight -metre and -yard races he wasn't about to let the streak end in tokyo he steadily pulled away from cuban enrique figuerola and harry jerome to win by two metres, tying the world record in the process he later anchored the american -metre relay team to gold, running his -metre segment in a jaw-dropping  seconds two decades later, the los angeles times called it """"the most astonishing sprint of all time""""
after the olympics, mr hayes signed with the nfl's dallas cowboys and played wide receiver for nine years because no single player could match his blazing speed, teams were forced to develop the zone defences that are now standard
after his retirement from football, mr hayes fell into alcoholism and drug abuse in , he pleaded guilty to selling cocaine and methaqualone, serving  months in prison he died in  at age  of liver failure
american jim hines set a world record of  seconds to win the first all-black -metre final in mexico city in  -- a mark that stood for  years winning times then eased back above  seconds for the next three olympics but since los angeles in , all -metre champions have broken the -second barrier
carl lewis did it twice, in los angeles and in seoul, where he inherited the gold medal forfeited by ben johnson mr lewis, like jesse owens, was gifted in several events in los angeles, he matched mr owens by winning four events: the  and  metres, the long jump and the  x  relay
when his father died in , mr lewis had buried his -metre gold medal with him """"don't worry,"""" he told his mother """"i'll get another one"""" so he was devastated when mr johnson crossed the finish line ahead of him in seoul
""""damn,"""" he thought, according to david wallechinsky in the complete book of the summer olympics """"ben did it again the bastard got away with it again it's over, dad"""" of course, the world soon learned that mr johnson hadn't gotten away with it after all, and mr lewis collected his replacement gold
after britain's linford christie won in  seconds in barcelona, and donovan bailey's memorable -second victory in atlanta, american maurice greene kept the sub- streak going with a  clocking in sydney in  a year earlier, mr greene -- who sports a tattoo of a lion with the initials goat (greatest of all time) in its mane -- had shattered mr bailey's world record with a mark of  seconds in , tim montgomery shaved off a further  seconds, though that record could be expunged if the drug charges against him are substantiated
all of which raises the question: how fast can a human being cover  metres without the aid of drugs?
- - -
when the modern olympics began in , the world -metre record was  seconds today,  years later, it stands at  seconds most of that improvement happened in the first couple of decades charley paddock ran the  metres in  seconds way back in 
in the  years since, the record has fallen by  seconds it has eased down by just  seconds since harry jerome and armin hary ran the distance in  flat in 
here's another way of looking at it when mr jerome and mr hary set their records, their average speed was  km/hr when tim montgomery ran his -second  metres in , his average speed was  km/hr -- a gain of  km/hr in  years
are we nearing the limits of human capability? somewhere, there must be a limit after all, no human could run  metres in eight seconds, or seven, or six could they?
""""part of me is very reluctant to say there is any limit to human performance,"""" responds bruce kidd, dean of the faculty of physical education and health at the university of toronto, """"because one of the things that has excited humanity is challenging and going beyond these limits""""
but even mr kidd, canada's top middle-distance runner during the s, agrees the rate of improvement in the  metres is declining most recent gains can be attributed to superior equipment and running surfaces, he says """"i wouldn't want to say all of the improvement can be accounted for by better shoes and tracks, but certainly a big part of it""""
while marginal improvements will likely occur, the pressures generated by sprinters seeking ever-faster times may eventually be too much for human physiology to bear
""""the forces that are placed on knees, ankles and tendons are just enormous,"""" mr kidd says """"we're excited by the pursuit of records, but we sometimes deny or sweep aside the tremendous costs""""
in , francois peronnet, director of kinesiology at the universite de montreal, studied -metre data from  to  and used linear projection to predict future times his prediction for  --  seconds -- was close enough to the actual mark of  seconds to give the exercise credibility
if mr peronnet is right, the world's fastest human will cover  metres in  seconds by  and in  seconds by  that's close to what another canadian academic has calculated using performance curves, robert schulz, professor emeritus of human kinetics at the university of british columbia, predicted that the fastest humans will be able to run  metres is  seconds
mr peronnet is unwilling to make a similar prediction """"there is somewhere a ceiling, i'm pretty sure of that,"""" he says """"but it's difficult to determine where the ceiling is""""
as we approach that ceiling, records may depend more on improvements in our measurement ability than in athletes, he says """"there's a chance we will have to measure the record not in hundreds of seconds, but in thousands""""
- - -
when the -metre finalists take their marks in athens on aug , winning -- not world records -- will be foremost in their minds but if history is any guide, a record time would pretty much assure the main prize only three sprinters have ever set or tied the world record in a -metre olympic final; all won gold
it will be a surprise if any canadians are among the final eight neither of our entrants, nic macrozonaris or pierre browne, has ever broken  seconds
the race is likely to be between greene, the self-proclaimed goat, who will try to repeat his victory in sydney; his american teammates justin gatlin and shawn crawford, who once raced a zebra and calls himself cheetah man; asafa powell of jamaica, who has twice beaten greene in the past month; trinidad and tobago's darrel brown; and kim collins of st kitts and nevis, the reigning world champion
who will win is anybody's guess but you can bet there will be high drama, probably some controversy, and most of all, speed enough lovely, can't-get-enough-of-it speed to satisfy even the centenarian sprinters among us

438689578,Immigrants isolated? Tell that to their children:   [ONT Edition ],"It was, and remains, the normal coalescing of newcomers who huddle in cultural clans - for at least one generation, or a part of a generation, before the native-born offspring of immigrants begin to assert their own imperatives on the dichotomy of the family, on their transplanted parents. This is the normal rhythm of the immigrant experience, although apparently a concept poorly understood by the authors of a Statistics Canada report released last week that warned about the isolation of visible minority neighbourhoods in Canada largest cities where segregation, it claims, has become entrenched. The ethnic neighbourhood - the cultural ghetto, as clearly disapproved by the StatsCan report - was like the warmth of a womb for post-war immigrants only a decade removed from a global conflagration, and surely no less so for more recent arrivals fleeing other tyrannies, other unpromising futures. Those of us born here as first-generation offspring, as gestated Canadians, sprang from this same amniotic sac of cultural nourishment but grew up rapidly absorbing the dominant ethos, pining to assimilate, glad to shed old country peculiarities. I see little evidence that a new generation of made-in-Canada Canadians feels greatly different. The street where I lived was primarily Italian in the '60s, a post-war influx that steadily displaced the Jewish families that had converged there previously. I remember my mother using a knife to remove the mezuzahs that former owners had affixed on the doorframes in our house on Grace St. But when my parents arrived in the neighbourhood, the Jewish presence was still strong and our existences overlapped. Remarkably, there was very little clash of culture. My father worked for a Jewish-owned construction company; my mother worked in a Jewish-owned industrial laundry on Shaw St. For two decades, that Jewish family spent Christmas with our extended Italian family. I don't recall any resentment, on my parents' part, toward this earlier wave of immigrants who had preceded them up the economic ladder. We wanted more to emulate their success than grumble about it.","i liken the immigrant neighbourhood where i grew up to a jawbreaker, the orbicular candy that used to cost a penny from a bubblegum dispenser, changing hues and flavours the longer you sucked on it
a more gifted writer would probably come up with a better metaphor, a more elegant way to describe the generational metamorphosis of a community that was sequentially transformed by every ethnic wave that settled within its ragged boundaries the urban neighbourhood as a recycled oil canvas, perhaps; a painting that, when scratched, reveals an earlier piece of work beneath the surface patina
at the centre of the jawbreaker was english canada, which in my west-end enclave of toronto meant blue-collar irish and scots, although not so dominant as they were elsewhere in the city then, in succeeding layers, came the jews and the italians, the germans, the greeks, the more ambiguous - to me - eastern europeans, the blacks, and then later the chinese, the east indians, the koreans and so on a rubric of what would become multicultural canada, although none of us thought of it then in those terms, this being the era before multiculturalism became capitalized and politicized and hyphenated in its ethnic subdivisions
we may have lived within our ethnic pockets - little italy or little greece and the like - because that is the natural tendency for immigrants venturing into a new world, seeking the sheltering embrace of the known in an unknown environment, a niche where people speak your language and eat your food, share your beliefs and understand your cultural otherness this companionship of like to like took the edge off our strangeness, allowed us to feel less alien
it was, and remains, the normal coalescing of newcomers who huddle in cultural clans - for at least one generation, or a part of a generation, before the native-born offspring of immigrants begin to assert their own imperatives on the dichotomy of the family, on their transplanted parents this is the normal rhythm of the immigrant experience, although apparently a concept poorly understood by the authors of a statistics canada report released last week that warned about the isolation of visible minority neighbourhoods in canada largest cities where segregation, it claims, has become entrenched
i suspect the problem, if one exists (and i'm not broadly convinced of this), is largely about time - not giving these uprooted and transplanted constituencies enough of it before expecting that they become something else entirely, particularly if they come from non-european, non-white countries with their own millennia of traditions, where attitudes have been shaped by vastly different experiences, where the liberal virtues we cherish in canada do not have the same traction, indeed where they are viewed with suspicion and alarm
what also problematic, i think, is that canada has devalued the concept of assimilation, promoting instead a mosaic of ethnic identification that is inherently splintering and isolationist, emphasizing as it does the details that make us different rather than the aspirations that make us so much the same
the ethnic neighbourhood - the cultural ghetto, as clearly disapproved by the statscan report - was like the warmth of a womb for post-war immigrants only a decade removed from a global conflagration, and surely no less so for more recent arrivals fleeing other tyrannies, other unpromising futures those of us born here as first-generation offspring, as gestated canadians, sprang from this same amniotic sac of cultural nourishment but grew up rapidly absorbing the dominant ethos, pining to assimilate, glad to shed old country peculiarities i see little evidence that a new generation of made-in-canada canadians feels greatly different
it was harder for our parents, and no wonder, but they tried, they did try we were a polyglot of peoples, fusing gradually, by osmosis, by a generosity of spirit that found its expression in church, at christenings and weddings where neighbours of different backgrounds were welcome, in the exchange of ethnic food - have some homemade wine, try this strudel - in the early and quite scandalous phenomenon of intermarriage and, most critically, in the public schools attended by that first generation of immigrant children we were canadian tadpoles, swimming into the mainstream, even within the ethnic patchwork of our neighbourhoods
the street where i lived was primarily italian in the 's, a post-war influx that steadily displaced the jewish families that had converged there previously i remember my mother using a knife to remove the mezuzahs that former owners had affixed on the doorframes in our house on grace st but when my parents arrived in the neighbourhood, the jewish presence was still strong and our existences overlapped remarkably, there was very little clash of culture my father worked for a jewish-owned construction company; my mother worked in a jewish-owned industrial laundry on shaw st for two decades, that jewish family spent christmas with our extended italian family i don't recall any resentment, on my parents' part, toward this earlier wave of immigrants who had preceded them up the economic ladder we wanted more to emulate their success than grumble about it
our separate cultures, confident within their own essence, were not averse to engaging with each other it was the overlapping, i think, that encouraged this engagement and made us less alien to each other, certainly less threatening
maybe that, in its clumsy and unsophisticated fashion, is what the statscan report was trying to get at but the isolation indexes applied in this overview put too much emphasis on where people live and too little on how they live, where their lives intersect, socially and economically it is entirely normal for a jamaican family, say, to patronize a jamaican grocers or for an indian family to buy from an indian retailer it natural to hire one another, to support one another business ventures, even to gather in social clubs and puzzle over this weird thing called canadian society
perhaps it was indeed easier, in another time, to mingle with different cultures, when most families lived in tidy houses and couples strolled along the street at night, neighbours stopping to chat in variously accented english on one another front stoop those high-rise suburban clusters are not conducive to neighbourliness but the children of newer immigrants still, overwhelmingly, go to school with one another, watch the same tv shows, listen to the same pop music, have the same rebellious conflicts with their parents it is the segregation of religious- based schools and the imposition of ethnocentric exclusivity on young social groups that should be discouraged
but, you know what? the children of immigrants, straddling two cultures, inevitably turn away from their parents' experience and assert their own commingled identity the ethnicity becomes diluted they will keep the bits that they value and discard the rest
it has always been thus, one generation to the next

439303569,Wanted Trademark Toronto deli:   [ONT Edition ],"It's not that Toronto doesn't have great Jewish delis. We've got the best New York pastrami money can buy, and you don't have to go far to get lox and cream cheese on an oven-baked Montreal bagel. Indeed, anyone looking for a good deli can find restaurants up and down Bathurst St. For the strictly kosher set, there's Dairy Treats and Marky's Deli, to name but two, and for bagel aficionados there is United Bakers and Bagel Plus, amongst others. And for those willing to venture slightly off Bathurst, the downtown crowd has an excellent Bay St. lunch spot actually called the New Yorker Deli, and Thornhill's popular Centre Street Deli imports the best of Montreal's Snowdon Deli cuisine. Here's my theory. When Jews came to English Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century, they settled with their taste for deli and created bustling centres like Toronto's Kensington Market. But back then, before massive immigration from across the globe, the best fare the locals had to offer - peameal bacon - was hardly something that melded with the Jewish palate. It may have been tasty, but it just didn't fit the bill.","my family spends august rediscovering toronto and, like most things we do, everything tends to revolve around food this year, it occurred to me that in many ways the history of our city can be written in its deli
top-quality montreal smoked meat with a new york sour dill is easy to find around town it's possible to find polish potato latkes or stuff yourself with a russian kishke but where can you get toronto-style anything?
it's not that toronto doesn't have great jewish delis we've got the best new york pastrami money can buy, and you don't have to go far to get lox and cream cheese on an oven-baked montreal bagel
indeed, anyone looking for a good deli can find restaurants up and down bathurst st for the strictly kosher set, there's dairy treats and marky's deli, to name but two, and for bagel aficionados there is united bakers and bagel plus, amongst others and for those willing to venture slightly off bathurst, the downtown crowd has an excellent bay st lunch spot actually called the new yorker deli, and thornhill's popular centre street deli imports the best of montreal's snowdon deli cuisine
all great restaurants - i recommend each of them - but none features anything that torontonians can distinctively call their own
deli, of course, didn't begin in toronto european jews, with their taste for pickled meats and cabbage, came to new york, mingled with the irish and their taste for boiled meat and cabbage, and new york's corned beef and coleslaw sandwich was born the same thing happened in the bakeries, where the european oddity of boiled buns met the american ingenuity for mass production, creating the now ubiquitous bagel
a similar phenomenon happened in quebec, where jews and their bagels encountered the pizzeria, giving birth to the oven-baked delicacy now known as the montreal bagel likewise, corned beef met the northern and rural penchant for curing in a smokehouse, eventually adding montreal's distinctive smoked meat to the deli mix
now back to my original question given our """"world class city"""" aspirations, where's the uniquely toronto deli food?
everyone loves a shopsy's or kwinter's hot dog but similar tube steaks are found in ballparks from boston to miami likewise, while there is nothing better than a crisp strub's pickle, delicious gherkins can be fished out of brine in barrels and jars all over america
here's my theory when jews came to english canada in the late th and early th century, they settled with their taste for deli and created bustling centres like toronto's kensington market but back then, before massive immigration from across the globe, the best fare the locals had to offer - peameal bacon - was hardly something that melded with the jewish palate it may have been tasty, but it just didn't fit the bill
so even though there might be nothing more canadian than the image of doug and bob mckenzie sipping on suds and frying up some savoury back bacon, there is also nothing less kosher you can't even dress it up as kosher-style try as the early deli pioneers might, the culinary graft just didn't take
and now with multiculturalism firmly in place, we may be stuck with having the best of everyone else's deli but nothing distinctively our own in the meantime, as summer ends, i'm planning to shed my toronto-style vanity, swallow my pride and order up a montreal smoked meat sandwich (medium, not lean)
that is unless someone comes up with toronto's very own kosher canadian bacon-style deli meat sounds delish, eh?

does diversity undermine core canadian values and social harmony? no, i said
canada was always legally diverse the  bna act recognized three racial, religious and linguistic collectivities the aboriginal peoples, the french and the english
multiculturalism is an evolution of that revolutionary model, and carries with it similar challenges, only on a larger scale

none of this is to say that some canadians of this or that ethnic or religious minority may not pose a security risk, only that it is facile to link it to multiculturalism and diversity

but in addressing it and tackling the challenges that we do face in integrating , immigrants every year, we need to be rational and avoid turning on minorities or multiculturalism
the multicultural model has, in fact, been a great success, and canadians know it, even if critics don't, said pollster michael adams, author of an upcoming book, unlikely utopia the surprising triumph of canadian pluralism

438519087,A ladylike battle for the vote; Canadian women held meetings as British counterparts were willing to 'spill their very lives' blood':   [Ontario Edition ],"Janice Newton, who teaches a course called the Politics of the Canadian Women's Movement at York University, said although the women suffrage struggle in this country was more staid, its inner workings, were nevertheless both fascinating and complex. Prominent suffragette Nellie McClung didn't throw stones at her opponents, Newton explained. Instead she flung stinging barbs to turn the anti- vote for women argument on its ear. """"Nellie McClung was the queen of satire."""" Up until about 30 years ago, Newton said, the early suffrage movement was viewed as primarily a pursuit by a select group of conservative, upper middle class women. """"In the 1970s, researchers looked at newspaper reports (published during the campaign for suffrage). Who gets published in newspaper reports? Not working class women."""" There were fierce divisions in the suffrage movement. Race was a hot button. There were strong anti-immigrant sentiments, especially toward people from China and India. A big question for the suffragettes was, """"Do you support those women getting the vote?"""" Newton said. """"Some thought every woman should get the vote regardless of race. Other women were quite racist."""" Some suffragettes argued that if lunatics and black men could vote, surely it was galling that a white woman could not.","they hurled bricks through shop windows and set fire to post offices they even resorted to bombing the country home of a prominent politician thrown in jail, they went on hunger strikes and declared they were willing to """"spill their very lives' blood"""" to gain the vote for women
surely, not in canada, you say? you're right canadian suffragettes- women who lobbied to gain access to the ballot box- could only read in awe about the exploits of their more militant british sisters on the front pages of the toronto daily star in the early part of the last century
during the years,  and  there was an endless stream of dispatches from across the pond with front-page headlines like this one, which appeared on april , : """"women, armed with explosives, inaugurate reign of terror""""
on this occasion, a group of british suffragettes tossed dynamite into a railway car and blew up a train the ladies focused on damaging property as opposed to life and limb
meanwhile the goings-on of the more polite canadian suffrage movement were largely relegated to the women's pages of the newspaper, under a banner called """"of interest to women"""" stories about the subdued canadian struggle appeared alongside the star's """"daily fashion hint"""" column, showing off the latest frocks and ads touting the right kind of corset and tonics promising relief of everything from dandruff to a weak constitution
while british suffragettes were being thrown in the dungeon for rioting in jail, the worst their canadian sisters suffered were blisters from the occasional mass march in the united states
one of the few times canadian suffragettes made it onto the front page was when they played host to the daughter of a jailed militant who came to toronto on march , , to plead her mother's case """"personally, i am not in favour of violence,"""" dr augusta stove gullen, a toronto suffragette was quoted at the time
but she didn't harshly judge her british counterparts; in fact she suggested that media reports were sensationalizing their exploits """"we have no right to pass judgment on the actions of the militant suffragettes because  all newspapers grossly exaggerated (and) make fair judgment impossible,"""" she told the star
janice newton, who teaches a course called the politics of the canadian women's movement at york university, said although the women suffrage struggle in this country was more staid, its inner workings, were nevertheless both fascinating and complex prominent suffragette nellie mcclung didn't throw stones at her opponents, newton explained instead she flung stinging barbs to turn the anti- vote for women argument on its ear """"nellie mcclung was the queen of satire""""
when told that giving women the vote would set husband and wife to bickering over politics, mcclung, a married mother of five, retorted that most couples she knew needed no excuse at all to have a good old- fashioned row
the positions relied on at the time for denying women the vote seem nonsensical today but the justifications were seriously debated during the second decade of the th century
women were too weak of body and spirit to participate in the volatile arena of politics giving females the vote was contrary to biblical teachings domestic discord would follow, the divorce rate would soar and birthrates would plummet if women were allowed near the ballot boxes the fairer sex would be degraded and sullied by getting universal suffrage besides, women didn't need the vote women were urged to use their feminine wiles and lovingly persuade the men in their lives
""""they felt the fabric of society would be torn asunder,"""" if women received the vote, newton said the suffrage debate didn't split along clean gender lines some women spoke passionately against gaining the vote while men made up about  per cent of the members of suffrage organizations
up until about  years ago, newton said, the early suffrage movement was viewed as primarily a pursuit by a select group of conservative, upper middle class women """"in the s, researchers looked at newspaper reports (published during the campaign for suffrage) who gets published in newspaper reports? not working class women""""
newton said there is now more of a sense that middle class women, poor women, socialists and ethnic minorities were trying to improve their lot by obtaining the vote she notes that there was a strong suffrage sentiment among the finnish and icelandic immigrant communities and jewish garment workers, for example """"a broad cross- section of women across the country were struggling for the vote, but they had varying motivations for seeking it""""
members of the high-profile national movement, the women's christian temperance union, wanted the vote so they could purge society of its sins """"if women could vote they would pass laws to ban alcohol, tobacco and prostitution,"""" or so followers of the protestant movement thought
a group of suffragettes in halifax were seeking the vote to help improve the lot of poor women """"they thought the vote would get women a roof over their heads""""
suffragettes in urban settings such as toronto wanted the vote to improve many of the public health conditions that plagued cities """"they were still having cholera scares people were still using outhouses,"""" newton said she noted that one leading suffragette was brought to the movement after her child died from drinking contaminated milk
there were fierce divisions in the suffrage movement race was a hot button there were strong anti-immigrant sentiments, especially toward people from china and india a big question for the suffragettes was, """"do you support those women getting the vote?"""" newton said """"some thought every woman should get the vote regardless of race other women were quite racist"""" some suffragettes argued that if lunatics and black men could vote, surely it was galling that a white woman could not
when women finally did get the franchise at the federal level in , it didn't include everybody and, getting the vote had little to do with prime minister sir robert borden's enthusiasm for equal rights and more to do with trying to get support for conscription from the wives and mothers of soldiers posted overseas
by the time women were granted the vote nationally, they had already gained the franchise in ontario, manitoba, alberta, saskatchewan and british columbia manitoba led the way by becoming the first province to grant women the right to vote in january,  quebec women were last, getting the vote in 
canadian women didn't seek suffrage just out of principle """"they were trying to get their issues on the political agenda,"""" newton said """"it's a struggle that continues to this day""""

let's not just lay the blame at the door of disenfranchised, non-college-educated white workers, though
blame those privileged republicans - men and women ( per cent white women, says cnn) who put their party above their country
lay it also at the feet of those far-lefties - hitherto allies in the fight for racial equality - who decided to make everyone feel the burn

their studies showed moral licensing at work: expressing support for obama made people feel comfortable expressing politically incorrect views they felt speaking well of obama showed their lack of prejudice, """"thus reducing their concern with acting prejudiced""""
""""doing good deeds can make people feel like they have earned the right to do even blatantly bad ones,"""" effron says
it takes very little to make people feel licensed, he says """" simply imagining, 'i could have done something racist, but i didn't' is enough to make people feel licensed to express less racial sensitivity""""
seven years later, mere expression of politically incorrect views has blown into a collective endorsement of racism a nation that had stood tall as a global beacon for equality in , and , felt so virtuous, it gave itself the moral permission to swing the other way

Prime ministers are not exempt from this, and because I served in that office for almost nine years, let me briefly recount some personal experiences.","  anti-semitism has no place in a tolerant society such as canada, yet this lingering evil is rising again, says brian mulroney
editor note: the following are edited excerpts from a speech given last night by former prime minister brian mulroney at the opening of an international conference on anti-semitism
toronto - i was born in baie-comeau, quebec in , the year the nazis marched and the allies responded my only recollections of the war are scenes of my dad marching proudly with fellow militia members, children whispers of german submarines lurking off our shores and my electrician father telling of the horrors of hitler and why he had to be crushed if civilization were to be saved my sisters and i understood very little of the unspeakable reality he sought to describe
there were no jews in baie- comeau it was not until i entered law school at universite laval in quebec city in  that i really came to know jews i had two jewish classmates, michael kastner and israel """"sonny"""" mass, one from a wealthy family and one working class like me we became friends and remain so to this day i learned about the tiny but impressive jewish community there, but little of its history and challenges in canada it was when i moved to montreal to practise law in  that i first came into contact with a large jewish community, which ignited my interest in and support of the jews and israel
by this time, the horrors of the holocaust and the systematic persecution of jews was fully documented why, i asked myself, would such evil be visited upon anyone, and specifically the families of this vibrant community i was getting to know?
the jews of montreal were remarkable families were close, values were taught, education was revered, work was honoured and success was expected how could it be, i often wondered, that the progenitors of people demonstrably making such a powerful contribution to the economic, cultural and political life of montreal and canada were reviled over centuries and decimated in a six-year period, beginning in the year of my birth? thus began my first serious reflections on and encounters with anti-semitism
following the holocaust, the cry of """"never again,"""" became both affirmation and promise we expected that humanity would forswear anti-semitism forever the founding of the state of israel in  reinforced this hope unfortunately, today, jewish communities and the world only jewish state globally confront this re-emergent evil
this latest anti-semitism did not surface suddenly, in a vacuum it forms part of a historical continuum that was only briefly interrupted, if at all, following the second world war where did it all come from, what makes it so resistant to suppression -- and will it ever end?
it all begins, i think, in that transitional period from bc to ad, a time with a variety of faiths vying for attention this came abruptly to a halt in ad  the destruction by the romans of jerusalem second jewish temple was the pivotal event of that era only christianity and judaism survived the catastrophe originally, the people who followed jesus considered themselves jews once a christian church evolved, however, it took up an antagonistic position toward judaism and its practitioners
jews, first and foremost, were branded with the most devastating of charges -- deicide they were accused of the stubborn refusal to accept christ godhead and his sacrifice they were pictured as consumed with a detestation of christianity and defilers of its rituals and symbols, the agents of satan and the future allies, if not the progenitors, of antichrist, their ultimate aim to destroy the one true faith
we can well imagine how ordinary men and women would have felt about jews as a result individuals in the medieval world were overcome by fear of a world where so little was understood demons lurked unseen, and therefore beyond retribution there was, however, one visible demon against whom one could retaliate -- the jew
it was the jew who was said to poison the wells and who was responsible for the black death the disappearance of children, in what has become known as the """"blood libel,"""" was readily and falsely blamed on alleged jewish murderers who required the blood of christian children for nefarious rituals all this infected countless christians with the soul-devouring virus of jew hatred
the founding of the inquisition in th-century spain fully effected the transition from religious to racial anti-semitism the issue in christian-jewish relations was no longer god but genes
the nazis, with their emphasis on racial and ideological purity, were the natural inheritors of those who for two millennia have been centrally motivated by anti-semitism nothing captures better the anti-semite single-mindedness than the account of hitler, just prior to his suicide as the third reich lay in ruins, calling on germans to maintain the """"struggle against the jews, the eternal poisoners of the world""""
contemporary anti-semitism has added the state of israel to its list of targets, to deny the jewish state its rightful place among the community of nations israel has become the new jew
canadians talk proudly of our tolerance and fair-mindedness often a tone of moral superiority insinuates itself into our national discourse but these virtues are of fairly recent vintage - - we have little to be smug about in , toronto witnessed the christie pits riot -- anti-semites terrorized a jewish baseball team in a street battle that went on all night
the next year in montreal, all the interns at hopital notre-dame went on strike to protest the hiring of a jew who had graduated first in his class at l'universite de montreal this man was forced to resign because, as le devoir reported, catholic patients would find it """"repugnant"""" to be treated or touched by a jewish doctor
in , the canadian jewish congress decided not to publish a study of the status of jews in english canada because the findings were so profoundly unsettling
overt anti-semitism was not limited to minor players in canadian society on feb , , prime minister mackenzie king met an elderly russian immigrant who related that he had built a furniture and clothing business on ottawa rideau and banks streets, had three sons and a daughter and was now retired -- a true canadian success story king recorded in his diary: """"the only unfortunate part  is that the jews having acquired foothold  it will not be long before this part of ottawa will become more or less possessed by them""""
a few months later, king visited germany to meet chancellor adolf hitler, and recorded: """"my sizing up  was that he is really one who truly loves his fellow man  there was a liquid quality about (his eyes) which indicates keen perception and profound sympathy calm, composed, and one could see how particularly humble folk would have come to have profound love for the man as i talked with him i could not but think of joan of arc he is distinctly a mystic""""
the following day, our prime minister had lunch with nazi foreign minister von neurath, who """"admitted that they had taken some pretty rough steps  but the truth was the country was going to pieces  he said to me that i would have loathed living in berlin with the jews, and the way in which they had increased their numbers in the city, and were taking possession of its more important part he said there was no pleasure in going to a theatre which was filled with them many of them were very coarse and vulgar and assertive they were getting control of all the business, the finance, and  it was necessary to get them out to have the germans really control their own city and affairs""""
and how did canada prime minister react to these diabolically racist and extremely ominous comments by one of the most powerful leaders of the third reich?
""""i wrote a letter of some length by hand to von neurath whom i like exceedingly he is, if there ever was one, a genuinely kind, good man""""
the prime minister sets both the agenda and the tone in ottawa is it any wonder then that canada was slammed shut to jewish immigrants before and during the war? or that, when asked how many jews would be allowed into canada, a senior immigration official famously replied: """"none is too many""""? the government even refused entry to a shipload of desperate jews, who instead sailed back to europe on a voyage of the damned
this was a moment when canada heritage and promise were betrayed

continued from page a
to this day, i cannot watch footage of the faces of jewish mothers, fathers and children consigned to the gas chambers without, as a canadian, feeling a great sense of sorrow, loss and guilt because of the federal government abdication of moral leadership, countless jews perished in hitler death camps and we as a country were deprived of them, their children and the glory of their lives

- in , while a very young lawyer, i made my first (modest) contribution to the defence of israel it was a moment of extreme peril for israel and i simply wanted to show my support
- in , at a quebec economic summit chaired by premier rene levesque, i was astonished to hear yvon charbonneau, then president of la corporation des enseignants du quebec (now an mp from montreal) denounce sam steinberg and other montreal jewish leaders in a decidedly racist manner i demanded the microphone and denounced mr charbonneau and his views on the spot
- when the government in  invited the palestine liberation organization united nations representative to be heard in parliament (when the plo was officially known as a terrorist organization), as leader of the opposition i summoned the israeli ambassador so that we could jointly excoriate both the government and the plo
- my government appointed the deschenes commission of inquiry on nazi war criminals who had escaped to canada because, as i said then, """"our citizenship shall not be dishonoured by those who preach hatred,"""" and """"canada shall never become a safe haven for such persons"""" much more could have been achieved had such a commission been appointed decades earlier when the evidence was fresher and the suspects much younger but the government had refused to act
- i appointed jews to my cabinet and to the highest reaches of the public service and judiciary i appointed three jews in succession -- stanley hartt, norman spector and hugh segal -- as chief of staff, perhaps the most sensitive and influential unelected position in ottawa
- i appointed norman spector as canada first jewish ambassador to israel, smashing the odious myth of dual loyalties that had prevented jews from serving in that position for  years
- i invited chaim herzog to make the first official state visit to canada by a president of israel on june , , i had the high honour of introducing president herzog as he spoke to a joint session of the house of commons and senate
- senator david croll was an outstanding member of the jewish community from ontario, elected to parliament as a liberal in  he never made cabinet for no apparent reason other than his jewishness i elevated this remarkable canadian to the privy council on his th birthday
- my view of canada foreign policy in the middle east was articulated as leader of the opposition when i said that canada, under my government, would treat fairly with the moderate nations in the region such as jordan, but that, first and foremost, canada would make an """"unshakable commitment"""" to the integrity and well- being of israel and for nine years we did precisely that
- we committed canada to participate in the gulf war in  the many reasons included the security of israel history will record we did the right thing
- in , i was the first foreign leader invited to meet with president clinton at a joint news conference, we were asked about the peace process here what i said: """"i'm always very concerned when people start to lecture israel on the manner in which it looks after its own internal security, because for very important historical reasons, israel is of course better qualified than most to make determinations about its own well being"""" i believe that to be true today
canada is a marvelous country that has provided sanctuary and opportunity to millions, but many groups of immigrants have suffered injustice and discrimination the story of the jews, however, remains markedly different the holocaust saw to that so when i ceased being prime minister, i continued publicly denouncing those that showed hostility or malice to israel or the jews history has taught us what happens when we don't
this does not mean that israel should be immune from criticism one can strongly disagree with policies of the government of israel without being called an anti-semite nor does it mean that a strong defence of israel right to security precludes the acceptance of a palestinian state whose citizens come to know the benefits of health care, educational excellence, economic opportunities and growing prosperity similar to those available in israel this should be the objective of all who believe in justice

the groundbreaking research, a joint effort by researchers at toronto's centre for addiction and mental health and king's college in england, has identified a plausible biological mechanism that links the effects of migrant status to the risk of developing psychosis
""""we knew schizophrenia patients and those at risk of schizophrenia release more dopamine in their brains when exposed to a social challenge,"""" said dr romina mizrahi, a study co-author and director of camh's youth psychosis prevention clinic and research program
""""immigrants and their children have higher dopamine synthesis capacity versus non-immigrants
""""when they are under stress, they also release more dopamine
""""these brain changes might explain the higher risk to develop psychosis that has been observed in immigrants""""
the report consists of two parts: the canadian study that examined the release of dopamine in its subjects when responding to arithmetic questions from a standard stress-inducing test known as the montreal imaging stress task, and the british study that looked at the dopamine production capacity among immigrants and non-immigrants
it excluded any subject who was pregnant or had used illicit drugs other than cannabis in the six months before the study began
""""one of the most consistent findings in the epidemiology of schizophrenia is the high incidence of the disorder among immigrant groups
""""the risk is particularly increased in immigrant groups who migrate from a country where the population is predominantly black-skinned to a country where the population is predominantly white-skinned,"""" said the -page study published in january by oxford university press
""""this increased risk of schizophrenia has been reported both in immigrants and in their children these findings have been replicated in a number of high-income countries: the netherlands, denmark, germany, the united kingdom and canada, clearly establishing that the incidence of schizophrenia is higher among migrant groups as compared to host populations""""
dopamine plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour and our brain releases the compound when we are interested in something however, those stress factors may tip the balance and alter the regulatory mechanism, mizrahi said
although the pool of subjects in each study was small ( in canada and  in the uk), mizrahi said the effect of immigration on stress-induced dopamine release among the subgroups of subjects - clinical high-risk subjects, patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers - was significant
""""not everyone with high dopamine levels will develop schizophrenia not all immigrants develop psychoses there are psychological and social interventions to minimize the risks when experiencing stress, people have different coping mechanisms,"""" said mizrahi, who recommended proper social and settlement support for newcomers
mizrahi said further studies should look at the impact of ethnicity and the generational aspect of immigration on dopamine function
""""while the reasons for the increased risk of schizophrenia and other psychoses in migrant groups are still unclear  there is increasing evidence that victimization, discrimination, social isolation, social defeat and growing up in an urban environment may contribute,"""" the study concluded

2211876077,Encouraging more respect for diversity over the holidays,Aucun(e) disponible.,"this topic is a very sensitive one here in canada, as some
feel new canadians from different countries are trying to push their
cultural and religious views """"these immigrants seem to have no
problem coming to our country, but refuse to meld into our canadian
culture"""" this is an issue i hear time and time again from family
and friends
my question has always been and will always be, what is canadian
culture, exactly? the answer is not universal, as most of us can
agree in certain areas, but not on other issues, especially when it
comes to holidays
currently, two of the major holidays celebrated in canada that are
statutory holidays -- christmas and easter -- are christian
holidays if someone from another faith wants a religious day off
from work, they have to book it as vacation time
it is also up to the discretion of the employer or company that one
works for whether it gives an employee this
requested time off is this really fair?
maybe it is fair to someone who celebrates christmas and thinks
this is the norm, but to someone who is not a christian, it may mean
not celebrating a special time with family and friends and, instead,
working, while others of a different faith get their holy days off
so, where is the middle ground? this is so easy, in my opinion, but
to others it creates such debates and accusations of being too
politically correct (probably some of the same debates and
accusations made when women demanded equal rights) canada is a
multicultural society; this is something all canadians agree upon
and most are proud of this that being said, we cannot celebrate
everyone cultural or religious holidays and have them off from
work, as there would just be too many holidays
instead, we should put more focus on holidays that are inclusive,
such as thanksgiving, canada day, family day and maybe include some
other holidays, such as earth day and an official multicultural day
these are the holidays that we, as a society, should be making a
big deal about, as they are inclusive and not exclusive, like
christmas and easter, which leaves those of non-christians faiths
out of the picture, thus separating us
i am not saying in any way one does not have right to celebrate
their cultural holidays or religious holidays; i just think it
should be done on one own time with people of like mind in their
place of worship or at home
i know this may be too much to ask in this day and age, but it
something that we should maybe begin working towards
in the meantime, we can start working our way to having a truly
inclusive canada and embracing our multicultural and diverse
canadian culture by making personal changes at home
instead of being offended or accusing people of different cultural
or religious beliefs of making a big deal about being politically
correct, try seeing it from their eyes take the steps not to assume
people have the same religious beliefs as you do or cultural
practices
during christmas, refer to it as """"the holidays"""" as there are plenty
of cultural and religious holidays happening at this time, not just
one
if you are certain of someone cultural and religious beliefs,
then by all means acknowledge this and wish them a happy (insert
holiday here) if you are unsure, don't assume; just greet the
person regularly or if suitable, like in december wish them """"happy
holidays"""" and make this phrase a part of your vocabulary
i think if we all started taking these small steps, we would become
a much more inclusive society and a lot of hate crimes would slowly
go away if we would all just suck it up and embrace our canadian
culture as one that embraces the diversity of its people
we need to stop letting culture, religion and ideology from
separating us
instead, we should find what we have in common and celebrate that

239316503,"Behold, the ministry of Public Fish:   [Final Edition ]","Linking two subjects under one department has policy implications. When employment and immigration were put together under one department of Employment and Immigration, the implication was that employment and immigration were related, the level of immigration varying according to the rate of employment. The situation could be remedied in [Brian Mulroney] departmental reorganization. The creation of a ministry of state for Public Works and Tourism would imply that tourists come to see our bridges and statues, which is the way it should be. Health and Justice can go together, perhaps combined with Oilseeds, so as to eliminate another minister. With a little thought, a department of Health, Justice and Oilseeds can accomplish something, such as legal and healthy salad oil. If it produces only oily malpractice lawyers, it will be time to reorganize again, perhaps creating a department of Federal-Provincial Oilseeds and moving Sport in with Health and Justice, which recent developments would seem to justify.","when brian mulroney shuffled his cabinet last week, he didn't shrink it, as some had predicted he didn't combine and reorganize departments he just moved some people around
asked to explain that, mulroney said such changes will take time and require new legislation:
''i didn't want to announce them today and then spend an extended period of time having public servants and politicians involved in changes as opposed to doing their jobs''
what he didn't say is that combining departments requires careful thought the effects of even a name change can be staggering
linking two subjects under one department has policy implications when employment and immigration were put together under one department of employment and immigration, the implication was that employment and immigration were related, the level of immigration varying according to the rate of employment
an exclusive relationship can be implied _ as in the department of fisheries and oceans the fish of lakes and rivers, not to mention streams, have suffered mightily under the present structure
having a single minister of state for small business and tourism suggests that tourism is a small business, or that tourists don't want to visit big ones
the situation could be remedied in mulroney departmental reorganization the creation of a ministry of state for public works and tourism would imply that tourists come to see our bridges and statues, which is the way it should be
that would still leave small business by itself and would not, therefore, eliminate a cabinet minister, but the creation of a department of small business and defence would accomplish that, as well as give a much-needed disarmament tilt to the cabinet
the unfortunate thing about that is that it prevents the creation of a department of agricultural defence, which would have been unique, but agriculture can be combined quite neatly with housing, in a department of agricultural housing, which will give proper emphasis to canada barns
intriguing new relationships are numerous the new department of communications and veterans affairs will help our veterans keep in touch, and the department of external supply and services will make sure our diplomats never run out of whatever it is they always run out of
that minister can sit at the cabinet table next to the president of the privy council and oceans what they will talk about is not certain, but you can guess the conversation will be deep
establishing a department of fisheries and finance would suggest an economy based on fish _ a risky proposition at a glance, but as good as any other, when you think about it
fisheries and finance will match up nicely with immigration and environment, which can be used to create a better environment for immigrants, or cause the deportation of polluters
science and technology should be separated, since the combination is dangerous the answer is to establish a ministry of state for youth and technology, since only young people know how to work vcrs and other technological stuff then science can be combined with transport, to make a transcontinental train that does not break down in the winter
health and justice can go together, perhaps combined with oilseeds, so as to eliminate another minister with a little thought, a department of health, justice and oilseeds can accomplish something, such as legal and healthy salad oil if it produces only oily malpractice lawyers, it will be time to reorganize again, perhaps creating a department of federal-provincial oilseeds and moving sport in with health and justice, which recent developments would seem to justify
these changes, in addition to greatly reducing the size of the cabinet, will have a significant impact on the way the country is governed the new president of the treasury and fitness board would help public servants quit smoking the new solicitor of state could resolve language problems in the nation jails
the department of regional industrial privatization could make sure that private industry stays private, not much of a chore under the circumstances the department of consumer and corporate multiculturalism could work to ensure equality in hiring as well as greater corporate gifts to multicultural pageants
of greatest potential value is a merger of the positions of minister of state for forestry and government leader in the senate this will create the new position of government leader in the forest, which it looks like it already needs

2597024993,Big Bird better role model than U.S. senator,Aucun(e) disponible.,"in , big bird stood in line for a mobile vaccination clinic - """"like a hospital right here in mr hooper's store"""" - after the emergence of a new combination vaccine to fight measles, mumps and rubella his contemporary, captain kangaroo, broadcast a similar initiative, talking about preventable diseases with his muppet friend, mr moose
when sen ted cruz decided to roast big bird for getting vaccinated against covid-, he may have bit off more than he could chew and definitely more than we should swallow
the sesame street character's twitter account made the announcement last saturday, after the us food and drug administration approved pfizer's vaccine for children aged five to  """"my wing is feeling a little sore, but it'll give my body an extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy,"""" the character tweeted, in the time-honoured tradition of using puppets to help ease children's fears
cruz launched a series of furious retweets, starting with """"government propaganda  for your -year-old!"""" and progressing to a makeshift video of a bird-costumed thug kicking in a door, captioned """"big bird coming over to vaccinate your kids""""
such inflammatory tactics hardly are becoming to a grown man, much less a legislator; however, in the opportunistic world of pandering to angry voters, preventing illness is dangerous, down is up, and public education is communism
cruz was not alone in championing resistance to health measures for a little free publicity pundits inhabiting the absurd end of the right-wing spectrum on fox news and newsmax called it """"brainwashing children"""" and """"evil"""" a few republican congressional candidates piled on, hoping to share in the spotlight
nevertheless, it was cruz with whom late-night comedians mopped the floor
the ladies on the view also landed a well-timed observation the senator appeared unfamiliar with a show that helps teach emotional self-regulation
it's likely the unctuous texas politician doesn't mind in the fame game, it's often said there is no bad publicity (although cruz certainly has challenged the maxim)
people with political aspirations know the power of name recognition they can get a lot of free exposure on the coattails of a beloved character, whether they're claiming mr potato head is transgender, or dora the explorer is an illegal immigrant if the perceived outrage can be framed as a threat to children, so much the better
the culture wars haven't been this absurd since the late rev jerry falwell """"outed"""" tinky winky, the purple, handbag-carrying teletubby, hysterically intoning, """"homosexuals do not reproduce! they recruit!"""" notwithstanding the fact teletubbies are genderless blobs in fuzzy rompers, the presence of diversity in children's programming is not a threat to children's healthy development (the opposite is true; representation matters) what is a threat to children's healthy development is the continued effort to drag health advice out of the realm of medical experts and into the arena of cynical political gain
children are at much lower risk of severe illness from covid-, but they can get sick and spread the virus the fda has found pfizer's vaccine, at one-third of the adult dose,  per cent effective at preventing the disease in young children; their immune response mirrored that of young adults aged  to  researchers have found no serious side effects the drug is still being studied for approval by health canada
public health education is not """"propaganda"""" children don't get to decide whether they want a vaccine, any more than they decide whether broccoli will be served at dinner they can express a preference - even aversion - but ultimately, the parents are supposed to be steering the ship cynical politicians are steering them wrong writerobin@baranyaica",The Kingston Whig-Standard,2021-11-13,2021,11,13

2216389913,Matriarch lived life full of grace,Aucun(e) disponible.,"m aria
makalo was born in  in the western ukrainian village of kurnyky
she was only  when the germans came, transporting her to bavaria,
press-ganged into the service of the third reich she was not alone
millions of ukrainians suffered a similar fate many would not
survive
being young and petite, maria was not the first choice of those
selecting slaves for hard labour paradoxically, that was lucky, as
when she was finally picked, it was by a farmer whose ailing wife
and two children needed help so maria worked mainly in the kitchen,
able to scrounge food and even sneak some to the polish pows the
farmer held captive
somehow, her father, stepan, a first world war veteran of the
austro-hungarian army and fluent in german, learned where his
daughter was from occupied ukraine, he posted letters of
encouragement, those few sheets of paper becoming some of her most
precious possessions, as she would never see him again
still a teenager when the second world war ended in may , maria
again found herself among millions of people cast adrift, political
refugees unwilling to return to soviet-dominated eastern europe,
where the stalinist regime was brutally suppressing ukrainian
nationalism maria's father was a member of the resistance captured
by the communists, stepan perished rather than renounce the cause of
ukraine's liberation his final resting place is unknown
the iron curtain then severed maria's ties to her mother, three
brothers and a sister, a chasm unbreached until the soviet empire
fell and ukraine regained its rightful place in europe, almost a
half-century later
not able to go home, maria instead found sanctuary in the freiman
kasserne displaced persons camp, near munich there she joined the
organization of ukrainian nationalists, becoming a trusted
underground courier
it was a dangerous time hundreds of thousands of """"soviet citizens""""
were forcibly repatriated to the ussr, there were political
assassinations, widespread criminality, and a climate of fear, many
believing a third world war was imminent
most dps lived """"on packed suitcases,"""" motivated by a """"compulsive
need to return home,"""" seeing themselves as the """"second line"""" of the
liberation movement, determined to husband their diaspora's
resources until they could get home they believed that would happen
soon they were mistaken their exodus would last for decades
unbeknownst to her, maria came under surveillance one day he
stopped her, in munich's famous english gardens fortunately, the
man who crossed her path was another nationalist his name was
danylo he became her unofficial escort and bodyguard and,
eventually, her husband, rarely leaving maria's side until she died,
peacefully, in his arms, in their bed, in their home, after more
than six decades of happily married life
resettled from post-war europe to kingston in , maria and
danylo found work, she at hotel dieu hospital, he at brock
jewellers at first, they lived in a queen street boarding house, on
the edge of
kingston's immigrant and working class north
end wanting to start a family, they moved to  nelson st,
infusing their home with all things ukrainian anyone crossing that
threshold immediately entered what maria and danylo remembered or
imagined ukraine should be like, a welcoming and happy place when
their children were born they named them lubomyr, """"lover of peace,""""
and nadia, """"hope,"""" signalling what their adopted homeland had given
them -- peace, love and hope
in their early years in canada, maria and danylo encountered many
people who knew little, if anything, about ukraine or ukrainians
she dedicated herself to overcoming that ignorance maria taught
ukrainian school, pushed her children to study hard, was a leading
member of st michael's ukrainian catholic parish, helped establish
the kingston and district folk arts council, the ukrainian maky
dance ensemble, and the ukrainian canadian club of kingston she was
the heart and soul of the lviv, ukraine, pavilion during kingston's
annual folklore festival for  years her commitment to her culture
and, in particular, to ukrainian embroidery and traditional cooking,
were a delight within her own hromada (community) and for the many
thousands of kingstonians she hosted over several decades we will
not see the likes of her pyrohy (perogies) and holubtsi (cabbage
rolls) again
and yet, while she always made sure people knew she was a
ukrainian, and what that meant to her, maria was equally keen on
learning about the lives and cultures of everyone she met, genuine
in her advocacy of multiculturalism, believing it to be a strong
pillar girding up canada's uniqueness as a society
maria and danylo's enduring support for the cause of ukrainian
independence was vindicated when the ussr collapsed in  at
almost the same time, they became grandparents, who savoured
watching their granddaughter, kassandra, become a woman and a young
scholar of modern ukraine's history for baba and dido (grandmother
and grandfather), there could be no more satisfying legacy
on the evening before she died, maria spoke her last words, in
ukrainian: """"goodnight, my children"""" her family was with her when
she passed she was calm and unafraid just like the mary whose name
she bore, maria had witnessed appalling suffering in her lifetime
yet remained a woman of faith parting with motherly words of
comfort, she finally went home, full of grace, to be with god,
reminding us of the psalmist's words: """"for he grants sleep to those
he loves""""

242234 6612,News outlets attempt to lift curtain on systemic racism:   Creating meaningful change takes more than just a pledge to diversify,Aucun(e) disponible.,"journalists have not had to go far to uncover searing stories of racism in canada - they're finding them in their own newsrooms, among their co-workers and involving their bosses
all while reporters increasingly turn their attention to detailing institutional discrimination in nearly all other facets of society, including justice, politics, health care and education
for the similarly flawed media industry, a long-standing problem has suddenly become harder to ignore: many outlets striving to inform the public of widespread racial bias do so with stories that are assigned, reported and analyzed by predominantly white editorial staff
the not-so-surprising result? they're failing, say industry watchers and a growing number of staff members risking their jobs to speak out and while many media organizations are expressing renewed commitments to diversify their newsrooms and coverage, those journalists say it will take more than pledges to create meaningful change
a series of missteps
revelations have emerged in recent weeks of racial indignities suffered at multiple news outlets, where current and former employees are attempting to lift the curtain on how and why tensions persist
corus entertainment faced a public lashing by rank-and-file staff over claims of toxic workplaces for people of colour; the national post endured a newsroom revolt over contentious columns that denied the existence of systemic racism in canada; cbc suspended and disciplined star wendy mesley for twice quoting a racial slur in editorial meetings and cbc radio's """"yukon morning"""" host christine genier resigned over the lack of indigenous representation in canadian media
while there might be an increase in the number of on-air personalities who are people of colour, that's not an accurate measure of success, says diversity consultant and former journalist hamlin grange, whose firm diversipro inc was recently hired by corus entertainment to review its operations
""""it's the people who are behind the scenes, the decision-makers that really matter and that's where the media in this country have failed""""
anything that fails to dismantle systemic and structural barriers are superficial measures that don't achieve meaningful change, said brian daly of the canadian association of black journalists (cabj)
more effective solutions
the cabj and canadian journalists of colour have partnered for a joint call to action that includes: regular disclosure of newsroom demographics, more representation and coverage of racialized communities (in part through hiring), and proactive efforts to seek, retain and promote black and indigenous journalists and journalists of colour to management positions
they also suggest regular consultation with racialized communities on news coverage, identifying and addressing systemic barriers, targeted scholarships and mentorship opportunities and encouraging journalism schools to lay the groundwork with diverse faculty and more focus on how to cover racialized communities
an expressed desire to address diversity is not enough, says tsn's sportscentre anchor kayla grey, who weathered blowback and sparked a twitter hashtag when she criticized white freelance journalist sheri forde for using the n-word in a medium blog post that ironically detailed forde's efforts at building racial awareness
""""companies and newsrooms are showing their ass right now,"""" said grey, the first black woman to anchor a national tv sports show in canada
""""i'm seeing people fumble and it's clear that they just don't have those voices in those rooms that check them in the first place or they might have those voices in the room, they might have that representation, but are they listening clearly to those voices? and have those voices felt empowered to speak out about such issues?""""
the effect on staff
the national post met condemnation both within and outside of its newsroom for several inflammatory commentaries, most notably one from rex murphy on june  that declared, """"canada is not a racist country"""" the online link now features an apology for """"a failure in the normal editing oversight"""" and points readers to a rebuttal by financial post writer vanmala subramaniam
nevertheless, murphy defended the piece in another column june  and post founder conrad black added his denials of systemic racism in columns on june  and , the latter of which dismissed the current reckoning with racial injustice and systemic racism as an """"official obsession"""" causing """"an absurd displacement for other concerns""""
a few frustrated staffers began withholding bylines from their own stories shortly after that first black column, growing to involve more as the week wore on
editor-in-chief rob roberts would not comment on the byline strike, only saying: """"we stand by our columnists' right to state their opinion""""
daly said it would be harder to dismiss the lived experiences of black people if they were welcomed into newsrooms and their leadership
next steps
in june, the cabj wrote an open letter to corus entertainment urging improved supports for black voices and staff while expressing solidarity """"with black employees at global news who have grappled with feelings of defeat"""" over repeated microaggressions
that was followed last thursday by another open letter to corus and its global news division signed by more than  hosts, producers, reporters, editors and camera operators with similar demands
corus has hired grange's agency, diversipro inc, to review the entire organization, while its executive vice-president of broadcast networks, troy reeb, said in a statement it's """"acting immediately"""" at global news to increase representation, remove systemic barriers to retention and promotion, and consult with marginalized communities on news coverage
entire communities and perspectives are at risk of being ignored or distorted when coverage is filtered through a predominantly white lens, says daly
and when that happens, news coverage can effectively uphold the status quo, sustain systemic barriers and actively deepen racial inequities, added anita li of the canadian journalists of colour
the growing response
despite recent high-profile transgressions, the media industry does appear to be confronting its role in upholding white bias, li said, pointing to emerging outlets, major media unions and larger organizations that have publicly committed to the calls to action
she said they include the toronto star, the globe and mail union, global news, and the walrus
the canadian press says it has met with the cabj and canadian journalists of colour on the recommendations and is working to ensure it has the proper infrastructure in place to fully enact them
li acknowledged that dwindling ad revenue, dropping readership and fragmented audiences amid a plethora of free online competitors make it financially difficult for many outlets but investing in diversity and inclusion pays off in the long run, she said, noting canada's immigrant and racialized population is growing

[...]even as that is taking place in the U.S., we can hear echoes of the same closed, reactionary, bigoted wave of...","monday morning, a few hundred protesters gathered in the road on university ave, outside the us consulate sat, kneeled and stood in silence to honour the victims of sunday night's attack on a mosque in quebec city
six had been killed as they prayed, dozens of others injured after a gunman opened fire in an act that would be, by mid-afternoon, denounced as terrorism by the leaders of all federal parties in parliament
prime minister justin trudeau would call it an attack on """"our most intrinsic and cherished values as canadians, values of openness, diversity and freedom of religion""""
on university ave, for the moment, marking the attack, those assembled said nothing, the members of what had been a noisy crowd letting the silence speak as the seconds ticked on cars in traffic held up by the event did not honk people bowed their heads
it had not been planned as a memorial in response to a terrorist attack on canadians the violence and deaths on our soil added a grim sadness to the proceedings, a horrific immediacy to the message but the reality of the attack had not changed what that message was, because those gathered had planned, from the beginning, to demonstrate their opposition to those things the political leaders spoke of: attacks on openness; diversity; freedom of religion; the politics of fear and division; islamophobia; and fear and hate
it came after a weekend in which the force of those things seemed relentless, in the confusion and chaos that followed us president donald trump's executive order banning refugees and immigrants and even permanent green cardholding residents from several muslim-majority countries from entering the country the order appeared to target muslims for no purpose other than that doing so would please bigoted supporters of the president and instill fear in his opponents
watching all this, alongside the rest of the world-rocking mixture of malevolence and incompetence of the early trump presidency (as brookings institution fellow benjamin wittes labelled it), it's hard to escape the fear that the world's biggest superpower is turning its back on the world and risks provoking war, and chaos, and worse
and even as that is taking place in the us, we can hear echoes of the same closed, reactionary, bigoted wave of sentiment in canada - in the campaign of conservative leadership candidate kellie leitch and the waves of anti-muslim xenophobia expressed by many of her supporters, in the fear-mongering of fringe media outlets, in the responses that land in the inboxes and twitter feeds of anyone who says anything about diversity
and then this attack in quebec city came
it all inspires fear, for sure terror, even, of what the world might turn into if these things go unopposed but alongside the fear, it inspires a resolve to do something it feels like a moment in history where to do nothing is to be complicit
as horrifying as the news over the weekend sometimes was, hope and inspiration came from seeing the crowds that assembled at airports across the united states demanding those detained be let go; the scenes of lawyers sitting on the floors and filling the cafe tables at those same airports to provide emergency help; the american civil liberties union's almost immediate court victories granting stays against some of the most immediately pernicious effects of trump's order reminders that the president of the united states of america is not the united states of america - and that he didn't even get a majority of the votes americans cast he has the power to do great damage, but he will not be unopposed
and here in canada, a letter put together for u of t students to write to their mps available online offers some suggestions off the top of how canada - our prime minister and parliament - can respond in concrete ways to what is happening in the united states if it is serious about the values we proclaim: to grant immediate asylum to those affected by trump's executive order; to lift to , the federal sponsored-refugee cap that is currently limiting the number of those suffering who are able to enter canada this year; to change the law to allow those refused refugee status in the us to apply for such status here; and to denounce trump's policies in plain english that is a starting place for our politicians
and for the rest of us, a place to begin thinking about what we need to do and to demand here at home - rather than smugly shaking our heads at what's going on abroad
standing on university ave as the silence ended and the chanting began again - demonstrations that would stretch on into the afternoon - i was struck by the sense of being surrounded by people who decided doing something is better than doing nothing that showing up to stand and shout is better than cowering and standing aside it was a crowd gathered in the face of hatred, proclaiming love in mourning, observing silence and finding hope out of fear, summoning resolve

herb dhaliwal stopped in front of the door of his new office when he was first appointed to the federal cabinet- awed by a bronze plaque with his title
minister
it was one of those moments when the -year-old thinks about how far he has come
""""it just hit me,"""" he recalls
""""i looked at it and it made me think about when i came to canada as a little boy    not speaking a word of english, coming from a small, dusty village in the punjab""""
canada's fisheries minister has lived a rags-to-riches story in canada
from the first grader who couldn't speak english, the son of poor indian immigrants became a taxi driver and office cleaner, then a millionaire businessman and, finally, a cabinet minister
he has held two cabinet posts, revenue and now fisheries
he toyed with leaving politics before the last election but stayed, hoping to play a role in turning around the liberals' sagging fortunes in his home province of british columbia
dhaliwal's name is also mentioned in political circles as a possible leadership contender down the road he doesn't rule it out
a supporter of prime minister jean chretien's leadership and a rare liberal breed- a bc mp- he became in  the first indo- canadian to join the federal cabinet
""""if somebody had told my grandfather    that his grandson would be a cabinet minister, he probably would have said, 'you're drinking too much,' """" dhaliwal says
""""to be able to do what i did, it reflects a lot about the country we live in it says a lot about canada""""
but friends insist it says just as much about this particular immigrant kid's drive
the key events of dhaliwal's life are told over a plate of penne in spicy tomato sauce at his favourite lunch spot, a small, noisy italian restaurant near parliament hill (he is a vegetarian, although the odd time he will eat a bit of chicken- or fish)
he arrived in vancouver in  to join his father and grandfather, who had come from india earlier
the family struggled there were six kids- the young harbance, or """"herbie,"""" and five girls his father worked as a labourer his mother washed dishes, picked strawberries and potatoes and worked on a processing line gutting salmon
the family helped dozens of relatives settle in canada by sharing their cramped home with the new arrivals for months at a time dhaliwal sometimes shared his bed with cousins
even at , he showed an entrepreneurial spirit he wanted to golf but had no money, so he sold bottles of coke to wealthy golfers, then had someone pick up the empties for him so he could collect the bottle deposit
he is still an avid and reputedly excellent golfer and also plays tennis, runs and skis he escapes from the office whenever he can to catch his teenaged son's hockey games
dhaliwal put himself through university with a series of jobs- taxi driver, gas jockey, saw mill worker he was still studying commerce at the university of british columbia when his father lost his vision
""""it was quite a traumatic thing for the family,"""" he says """"it's always the responsibility of the son to make sure you take care of the family that was an important part of my responsibilities""""
that sense of duty helped launch a business empire
with a mop and pail, dhaliwal started a tiny janitorial business in a makeshift office in his parents' basement the future cabinet minister polished floors, washed windows and emptied rubbish bins
he and a partner had a staff of  by graduation and, eventually, there were close to  employees """"we didn't need a lot of capital, so it was mostly hard work,"""" he says
he branched out into other areas, including construction and land development the ex-taxi driver built up a fleet of  airport limousines
after he became minister, the president of a vancouver firm came to see him to pitch an ocean-mapping project- completely unaware he was talking to the man who used to supervise the crew that cleaned his office
old friends say it was always clear he would make good
university pal moe sihota, now a new democrat member of bc's legislature, says dhaliwal was driven even back in the 's, when he wore sideburns and shirts unbuttoned """"almost to his navel, a la john travolta""""
one of his money-making ideas was the limo service at the vancouver airport it came to him when he and sihota flew into toronto for a student conference dhaliwal insisted they take a limo instead of a regular taxi to their hotel
""""we get into this limousine and he's looking around, big eyes    and he says, 'you know, somebody should do this in vancouver,' """" sihota recalls
""""we went to the student conference    and he would not shut up about the limousine thing and we got on the plane and all the way back he just nattered at me about this damn limousine idea""""
sure enough, dhaliwal started pestering government officials about getting access to the airport for a limousine service it took years, but he finally got what he wanted
""""he was so persistent and pressing and irritating to the bureaucrats in the ministry of transportation, finally they just relented,"""" says sihota
""""he diversified his businesses and really made a fortune with the limousines- just because he was driven    he never doubts his capacity to do things""""
dhaliwal says he went into politics- a move that has forced him to put his carefully nurtured businesses into a blind trust- to """"try to improve people's lives""""
it's a lesson he learned from his parents and from his sikh faith
""""in the culture and the religion, we very much believe in sharing and helping and devoting a certain part of your life to what they call sava- to helping others,"""" dhaliwal says
""""i fundamentally believe that every person should devote a part of their life to helping others""""
he also takes to heart his connection with those who share his immigrant roots
""""it is added pressure because people look at you and if things don't go right, it affects them as well,"""" he says """"if i get criticized in the paper, the south asian community is usually more upset than i would be because they see themselves in me as well""""
another long-time friend, paul uppal, says watching dhaliwal's rise from poor immigrant kid to one of the top jobs in the country is a profoundly important symbol to indo-canadians
""""it really sends a message that we all can be whatever we want to be,"""" says uppal, who was dhaliwal's punjabi translator on his first school day
but being fisheries minister is clearly not something that was on dhaliwal's dream list
he has made no secret that he would rather be doing something else- say, running an economic department like trade when he was asked to take over the portfolio, he reminded the prime minister he had been fishing only once and hadn't caught a thing
dhaliwal found himself in the thick of controversy, virtually from the day he was appointed the sarcastic line often repeated in his office goes: """"fish, good news all the time""""
even family members call to vent their frustrations over bad times in the industry he hadn't been minister for long when his sister phoned, upset that the processing plant where she was a line worker was shutting down because of dwindling west coast salmon stocks
""""i remember her telling me, 'how come there's no fish out there? how come our jobs are being shut down? can't you do anything about this?' """" dhaliwal says
""""i told her it's something i couldn't do anything about it's the reality of what has happened in the fishing industry but, of course, people don't understand""""
just weeks after he was promoted to fisheries from revenue in , a ruling from the supreme court sparked violent clashes over native fishing rights in atlantic canada he is still grappling with the dispute, searching for a way to prevent more violence- and facing regular attacks from both aboriginals and commercial fishermen
recently, he and indian affairs minister robert nault unveiled plans for a new round of negotiations native chiefs complained that the announcement offered little to help ease tensions
""""it's not an easy portfolio,"""" says dhaliwal """"it's not nice when you have to do things like shut down fisheries and things like that affecting people's lives""""
his relations with some senior bureaucrats in his department are lukewarm at best officials grumble privately that he has devoted too much attention to building an aquaculture industry and too often allows politics to get in the way of making tough decisions
the people who work most closely with him say dhaliwal is eager to build consensus he is also known for never losing his temper, even in the most trying moments
before the november federal election, he seriously thought about quitting politics to return to vancouver he missed the business world and was frustrated by the slow pace of getting decisions made in government
all the travelling to and from his riding and repeated trips to the east coast were rough on his wife, amrit, and their three children- andrea, ; justin, ; and jessica,  the family lives in ottawa's posh rockcliffe neighbourhood but still owns their suburban vancouver home
dhaliwal's departure would have been a blow to the liberals, who have few safe seats in the west
chretien ultimately convinced him to stay, appealing to the sense of duty that has been such a strong driving force throughout dhaliwal's life- duty to society, to family, to fellow immigrants, to his party
there are still things he would like to do in politics, dhaliwal says, such as helping the liberal party reconnect with bc voters he thinks new measures to help the provincial economy would be a good start
many ottawa insiders expect he will get a portfolio more to his liking in a cabinet shuffle expected this spring dhaliwal says he has made his preference known to the prime minister but hasn't sought or been given a promise of a new job
ever loyal to chretien, with whom he golfs when ottawa's best courses aren't covered in snow, he adds: """"the prime minister decides    whatever he wants me to do, i'll be there working for him""""
some liberals hope dhaliwal will take a run at the leadership when chretien steps down, likely in a few years
as a westerner and an immigrant, they see him as a dream candidate to have on the platform as a symbol of the party's diversity
even staunch supporters acknowledge he would probably be a long shot, but he sounds like a man who is interested in the challenge
""""i think i would bring a different perspective i don't think we have had a candidate whose mother tongue was not english or french, who grew up in a new immigrant family,"""" dhaliwal says
""""there's a third dimension to canadian society that's often been forgotten in the past    there's a lot of people who would identify with me""""

by maryka omatsu
between the lines press,  pages, $, pb
it has been four years since japanese canadians finally won redress from the federal government for their internment during world war ii and the confiscation of their property
in the s the uphill battle to obtain a formal apology from the government and symbolic individual compensation for the , canadian citizens of japanese heritage was begun by a determined, obstinate group from this community bittersweet passage: redress and the japanese canadian experience by maryka omatsu is a moving personal account of this struggle by one of the negotiators of the september, , agreement to compensate these canadians for the loss of their citizenship rights
omatsu, the chair of the ontario human rights tribunal and an environmental lawyer in toronto, chronicles the courageous campaign to persuade the once silent community to shed its resignation she recounts the generational and cultural differences that made the journey so slow and arduous
""""during the s,"""" she writes, """"most japanese canadians had naively placed their trust in their canadian leaders even decades later the betrayal was difficult to confront many felt like an adult who was sexually abused as a child and has to face both the act of incest and the parent as perpetrator""""
bittersweet passage documents the government attempts to obstruct discussions by portraying the japanese canadian community as divided in its goal, and the manoeuvrings of prime minister brian mulroney and of the string of ministers of multiculturalism responsible for the negotiations, who time and again revealed their ignorance of the issues otto jelinek, minister of fitness and amateur sport and multiculturalism from  to , in an attempt to ingratiate himself in his first meeting with the redress committee, all of whom were canadian born, informed the members that, like them, he was a recent immigrant to canada

2012749523,Caboto Club a victim of selective bullying,Aucun(e) disponible.,"it must have come as one heck of a shock to windsor's social justice warriors to discover that their feverish assault on the caboto club over its membership policies didn't produce an immediate grovelling capitulation
i'm a longtime believer in equality of opportunity for both sexes - dating back to the s when there were glaring, indefensible inequities - but couldn't help feeling a touch of admiration for an organization that refused to be bulldozed by its strident critics
no doubt the shrewd, getwith-the-times move would have been to immediately issue a craven apology, on bended knee, and announce that henceforth the club's women will be full voting members eligible to join its board of directors or, better, assigned half the board seats
but when you push too hard, when you single out folks in a way that embarrasses them and exposes your own hypocrisy, you should expect pushback and that's precisely how club members responded to the badgering, bullying and browbeating of one of windsor's most generous organizations
what happened to the war on bullying? a year or two ago we were told, in waves of public service ads, to fight bullying because everyone should be treated with respect
where, in all the fingerpointing and boycott threats, was there any respect for the -year-old caboto club's efforts to sustain and enhance the local italian community while helping build windsor? the club, according to its records, was started in  by  men who organized a new year's eve dance in a separate school gym it was formalized the following year as the border cities italian club
i can't imagine how difficult life must have been for an italian immigrant - the stereotypical outsider - in protestant anglo ontario in those days and the decades that followed picture the grief that came with being labelled, and sometimes locked up, as an """"enemy alien"""" in the second world war with emotions at a fever pitch those who came after the war, forsaking a battle-ravaged land, didn't have it much better
but these folks, blessed with a powerful work ethic and hands-on skills, created the dominant ethnic community in windsor the caboto club, built with their donated sweat and ingenuity, is a symbol of their success
and yet prejudices linger
in recent days i've heard people, furious that the club hasn't seen the error of its ways, blame its intransigence on """"a bunch of old italian guys stuck in the past"""" ok so now we have ageism and a dash of bigotry in pursuit of gender equality how's that for progress? someone made a good point the other day: if a club based on gender, an institution developed as a men's fraternity, is now unacceptable, how can we tolerate having clubs based on ethnic identity? or awards, like italian of the year, based on that same identity? isn't that a divisive form of tribalism that merits condemnation by our social crusaders? there are so many cans of worms waiting to be opened
what's puzzling is how this private club's membership policies can be so offensive and yet other organizations, from religious groups to university fraternities and sororities, get a gender pass? we have places of worship here and across canada that physically separate the sexes that should be intolerable but no one dares criticize we have a roman catholic faith with a male-dominated hierarchy and yet no one speaks of boycotting its churches and schools
it sticks in a lot of male craws that we have womenonly gyms across canada promoting male-free settings where women don't have to worry about being ogled by the opposite sex
i have no problem with that it makes sense to me that there are places where women can work out without feeling intimidated or harassed
but shouldn't, quid pro quo, there be places, like an italian club, for instance, where men can discuss the great issues - wine, women and work - without the now dreaded fear of saying the wrong thing in a female's presence? nope it seems, in the time's up era, that nothing less than unconditional male surrender will be tolerated

regulations announced tuesday by culture minister helene david will require businesses with non-french trademarks to display prominent french signage, whether it is a slogan, a description or a message about what's on sale
""""it was essential to act in favour of the french language, which remains the common thread of our history,"""" david told a news conference outside a montreal wal-mart
david said that over the past  years, complaints to quebec's language watchdog about businesses with english names have been increasing but the courts have determined that under existing language regulations, companies with an english brand name were not obliged to add a french phrase to their signs
in , ruling on a court action brought by best buy, costco, gap, old navy, guess, wal-mart, toys """"r"""" us and curves, superior court justice michel yergeau wrote that it is up to the government to legislate if it believes a """"wave"""" of english trademarks threatens quebec's french character
the new regulations provide businesses with three options to increase their french presence the trademarked name can be accompanied by a generic description or a slogan, as a number of companies already do for example second cup added """"les cafes"""" before its name in quebec, and the eyewear chain new look added """"lunetterie"""" the french can also be used to present information about what is for sale inside; background documents used the example of a restaurant advertising its lunch menu
the regulations, to be published wednesday, require that the french addition be in the same field of vision as the principal sign and that it be illuminated at night if the main sign is the rules will apply immediately after the regulations' adoption to new signs, but there will be a three-year delay to bring existing signs into conformity
a government analysis estimates that about , businesses will be affected by the regulations, and the changes will cost them a total of $ million
under quebec's language law, bill , businesses are required to have signs predominantly in french, but there is an exception for trademarked names as national and international brands increasingly come to dominate the commercial landscape, english has become much more visible in quebec's malls and on its main streets
david pitched the new signs as """"an opportunity to enrich quebec's french face"""" that could prove profitable to business """"it is a sign of respect toward the cultural environment of the quebec collectivity,"""" she said
the federation of quebec chambers of commerce expressed support for the proposed changes """"we always support efforts and reasonable measures from the government that favour the french fact while contributing to the linguistic peace we observe today,"""" federation president francoise bertrand said
parti quebecois language critic maka kotto said the new measures are """"too little, too late"""" he said a complete overhaul of bill  is needed, protecting french not just on signage but also in the workplace and among new immigrants

Another Quebec round. Only the self-deluding will suppose that Quebec will be satisfied with whatever it gets this time around. As a minority, it must forever test the mettle of the majority. Anyway, the Parti Quebecois is bound to win an election sooner or later, as all official oppositions always do. To fulfill its ideology, the PQ will have to try to get more bits and pieces of jurisdiction for Quebec. Even if this entire present deal goes bust, the roundabout will still go around. Quebec would hold its referendum. The sovereignty option would win. All but certainly, though, Quebec then would demand a new constitutional round to define its sovereignty within Canada. Instantly, the other nine provinces would proclaim that they too are sovereign. Our constitutional experts would clamber back on stage to explain that provinces already are sovereign within their own jurisdiction anyway. And off we'd go again.","this column contains not a single word about the constitutional deal that the first ministers may discuss in ottawa this week in the presence of quebec premier robert bourassa, or may discuss next week if he is absent this week
there not even the ancient mariner could have done a better job of seducing readers into the body of a column except that, as more experienced readers will have guessed already, my reason for tugging you in this far is to throw an albatross at you
rather than being about today's constitution deal, this column is about all the other constitutional deals that are going to follow this one
among all the other deceptions (and self-deceptions) being perpetrated by the first ministers, none is more transparent than their pretence that they are writing canada's new constitution
they are doing no such thing they are merely writing, or are trying to write, a new constitution - until our next new constitution
the best constitutions are those written long ago as if in stone by a bunch of gray-beards (all still white males, it must be admitted, but at least clad in robes, or at any rate in frockcoats, rather than in suits) out of antiquity and of permanence comes respect by the public
we once had a constitution like that, the magnificently obsolete british north america act of  it devoted just two sections to the guts of national affairs, the division of federal and provincial powers, and expended the rest of its space on the real political stuff about who got to appoint judges and senators
nonsense although much of the bna act was, it provided us with a platform upon which we could do anything we wanted to do all of the policies that shape contemporary canada - bilingualism, multiculturalism, regional equalization, comprehensive social security, quebec's de facto status as a distinct society - were implemented without changing one jot or tittle of the bna act
as an even greater achievement, the hoary old bna gave us a national epigraph that defines us exactly and poetically this was that canada's national purpose is, """"peace, order and good government""""
today, our national epigraph ought to be changed to """"constitutions 'r' us""""
we've devalued our constitution by constantly chopping and changing it in an attempt to solve our (ever-changing) political and social problems
it no longer has any antiquity nor any permanence so it is losing respect its status is descending toward that of a throne speech at the start of each parliament
the particular constitutional deal now being negotiated by the first ministers is a good (and an appallingly bad) example of what's happened the truth about it, despite all the hype and hysteria about saving canada, is that no matter what deal may get done it won't be that big a deal because it won't be a done deal
without difficulty, it's possible to identify at least three new constitutional rounds coming our way right after this one
a republican round the queen is a wonderful person, even if all her kin are not but we just cannot cling to her skirts forever, and anyway will be forced to make up our minds once the australians turn themselves into a republic, as they are very likely to do in 
a native round the concept of """"self-government"""" is inspired; implementing it will be excruciatingly difficult among most indian people, the real governing unit is not the tribe or the band but the extended family we could end up with thousands, literally, of new """"third order"""" sub-governments a new constitutional round will be needed to define what we meant, for the native peoples this time around
another quebec round only the self-deluding will suppose that quebec will be satisfied with whatever it gets this time around as a minority, it must forever test the mettle of the majority anyway, the parti quebecois is bound to win an election sooner or later, as all official oppositions always do to fulfill its ideology, the pq will have to try to get more bits and pieces of jurisdiction for quebec

2302341013,"Immigration takes a back seat, and business is pleased",Aucun(e) disponible.,"in the waning days of the last parliament, canada's ceos publicly called on the country's political parties to keep immigration off the table in this fall's election campaign
their wish came true, more or less, until this week
with alberta premier jason kenney bursting into the suburbs around toronto on the weekend, and the presence of people's party leader maxime bernier at the english-language leaders debate on monday, what had mostly been a discussion at the riding level finally emerged nationally
but the worst fears of the business community have not materialized
rather than degenerating into an anti-immigrant brawl with racist overtones, the discussion has been rational and measured for the most part, with bernier's opponents labelling his call for lower immigration levels as irrational and intolerant
canadian business leaders had looked at the anti-immigration sentiment developing in the united states they looked at some of the backlash in canadian politics as thousands of asylum-seekers walked across the border from the us and they looked at the state of their workforces, their need for labour and the projections for growth going out a few years into the future
they didn't like what they saw
""""we are  years away from a true demographic pressure point,"""" business council of canada president and ceo goldy hyder told reporters in april """"what i've said to the leaders of the political parties on this issue is, 'please, please do all you can to resist making this election about immigration' that's as bluntly as i can say it to them""""
business leaders and many economists argue that canadian immigration levels need to rise if the economy is to grow fast enough to support a burgeoning number of seniors into retirement without increased immigration, the workforce won't expand, and the number of people depending on that workforce for benefits and supports will be insufficient
the liberal government admitted , immigrants in , with a goal of , by  about  per cent of those are meant to be economic migrants, selected to meet federal and provincial labour needs
bernier proposes to cut that number to ,, and polling over the past few months suggested he might have the ear of a growing minority of voters
but instead of taking the bait, as business leaders feared, the other parties were steadfast bernier's federalist opponents found a rare moment of agreement on monday night, with all of them expressing support for increasing immigration levels
it actually started last week, when conservative leader andrew scheer blurted out in a television interview that yes, he would support the liberals' general immigration plan
""""that's a legacy that i'll continue to build on,"""" scheer told the cbc, explaining that an open and inclusive immigration policy is crucial for a growing population and a healthy workforce canada's role as a safe haven for migrants is something to be valued, he added
scheer also said a conservative government would find better ways to allow temporary foreign workers to stay at length in canada and become permanent residents - a boon to employers looking to bolster their staffing over the long term
while the business community may have its wish of no bitter immigration debate, it comes with a side effect: there is also very little discussion around how to improve the integration of immigrant workers so their skills are put to best use
meanwhile, there are signs the immigration discussion is not always so genteel at the riding level, and some conservative promotional material has been more aggressive in attacking the way the liberals have handled refugees kenney played into that sentiment last weekend in a tour through an array of diaspora gatherings around the gta
when the conservatives were in government, he said in richmond hill, """"we sent a message that if you wanted to come to canada, you should come legally through the front door, waiting your turn in line, not sneaking around it by cutting the queue""""
and the scheer campaign has issued bumper-sticker style social media slogans urging a fairer immigration system
while that's a far cry from the anti-immigrant backlash that the business community feared, corporate canada has not exactly seen all of its campaign dreams come true
global growth is slowing, free trade patterns have been deeply disrupted by us-china tensions, and canada's prospects are anemic in a new forecast from the conference board of canada on monday, economists pegged canada's gross domestic product to expand by just  per cent this year, despite a pace of nearly four per cent in the second quarter the culprits? global trade, hesitant business investment in canada, and exports
the longer-term challenges for canadian growth are equally troubling, with the prospects of widespread automation, a world turning away from fossil fuels, and an aggressive knowledge-based economy on the horizon
but if the discussion around immigration at the national level is practical and pro-business, the discussion around canada in a rapidly changing economy is nearly absent",Toronto Star,2019-10-09,2019,10,9

an iraqi doctor emerges to discuss his case with volunteers a physician from afghanistan trudges out for fresh air an iranian couple, adherents of a minority religious sect, watch nervously over their two young children
they are among the thousands of people who have come to australia claiming asylum as refugees, but whose quests for freedom ended in detention the government labels them illegal immigrants or """"unauthorized arrivals"""" and locks them up for violating australian law
their crime: fleeing persecution abroad, without first seeking permission to come ashore
australia is alone among western nations in imposing mandatory detention on anyone who turns up without a visa for nearly a decade, it has rounded up boat people and deposited them in a half- dozen camps, dubbed gulags, in remote desert locations
incarcerating refugees - up to , at any one time - is a controversial experiment in public policy that other western countries and the united nations are watching closely yet the lock- ups have struck a responsive chord in this island continent, which had an official """"white australia"""" policy until the s and has long harboured fears of being swamped by a rising tide of illegal migrants from asia
iraqi physician aamer sultan is one of those people
a member of iraq minority shiite sect of muslims, he fled in  after the secret police harassed him for treating shiite rebels in his medical practice three years after his arrival, he is an unwilling participant in his own field research, studying the impact of incarceration on his fellow detainees at this facility outside sydney
sultan work has been published in prestigious journals and won him a human rights award - but not the freedom to claim his prize he spends his days in the lock-up, no longer bothering to shave just watching, writing and waiting
refugee determination officials rejected sultan asylum application, disputing his testimony that he could be persecuted in saddam hussein iraq he says his choices are risking imprisonment in iraq or remaining detained in australia
""""either you go back and get killed or you stay here,"""" he says bitterly """"australia has set a very successful example for other countries to do this, as long as they can get away with it""""
sultan says people who languish in detention, where they are subjected to humiliating surveillance checks by guards throughout the night, suffer almost as much as if they'd remained in their homelands rummaging through a sheaf of notes from his field work, he says the symptoms of mental stress follow a predictable pattern eighty-five per cent of detainees manifest clinical depression marked by sleep disorders, bedwetting, weeping and night terrors
""""very few of them are handled like human beings,"""" he says """"the guards are acting as if we're criminals""""
many detainees have to be medicated and sedated the tension often leads to psychotic episodes, culminating in anti-social and self-destructive behaviour and the result can be outright hostility toward the very country where the detainees once wanted to settle
australia ombudsman concluded last year that """"immigration detainees have lesser rights than convicted criminals held in jails""""
the camps, despite their remote locations, keep coming back into the public eye hunger strikes, self-mutilation, attempted suicides, riots and breakouts have made front-page news in recent weeks guards dressed in riot gear use batons and restraining devices to deal with the outbursts as recently as friday, a riot at a detention centre on the northwest coast injured  security guards
against that backdrop, many social critics, including prominent right-wing politicians, are asking whether the deliberate policy of deterrence is not only cruel, but counterproductive they point out that the camps create misery by keeping people penned in, while failing to keep outsiders from sneaking on shore
desperate asylum seekers - most often from afghanistan, iraq and iran - are not easily dissuaded fleeing dictatorships or war, they often give their life savings to people-smugglers and then risk death to reach australia several rickety vessels are known to have sunk en route, including one boatload of  people who drowned off the coast of indonesia in october
""""it makes my blood creep that this is going on in my own australia,"""" says thomas keneally, the acclaimed author of schindler ark, an account of how a sympathetic factory owner gave sanctuary to jews in nazi germany """"putting people for two to three years in the desert? it grotesque this government has let out the demon of xenophobia""""
like many critics, keneally accuses politicians of abdicating their leadership responsibilities by appealing to voters' baser instincts the two major parties, the ruling liberals and opposition labour, have supported the detention policy ever since a labour government opened the first camp in the early s
a majority of australians support the policy, but tens of thousands of sympathizers have protested against it in recent months - on the streets of sydney and melbourne, but also at the notorious woomera detention centre, in the australian outback
demonstrators overwhelmed the security forces on several occasions, enabling detainees to escape in the confusion but they rarely make it very far in the searing desert heat
one protest leader is no less an establishment figure than former prime minister malcolm fraser a member of the liberal party, which is considered more socially conservative than labour, fraser calls the isolated woomera camp a hell hole that should dissuade other countries from considering the australian approach
in last year australian election, the two main parties outdid one another in pandering to anti-foreign prejudices, particularly in the wake of sept 
as boatloads of asylum seekers headed toward australia in the fall, prime minister john howard vilified them as queue jumpers and """"not the sort of people"""" welcome in australia he deployed naval commandos to ward them off and, when the migrants refused to turn back, the government added a deterrent to its detention policy by rerouting unauthorized ships to remote pacific island states such as nauru
dubbed the pacific solution, it could cost australia more than $ million this year in direct subsidies to its neighbours, who are holding more than , people in the camps
church groups and human-rights organizations say the government is offloading the problem to ensure the boat people will be out of sight and out of mind """"it not good policy,"""" says ellen hansen, spokesperson for the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr) in australia """"we're concerned about the precedent it sets for other countriesmandatory detention is inherently undesirable""""
amnesty international secretary-general irene khan says the policy harms australia international image and reputation for fairness
""""there is nothing fair about locking up hundreds of children, women and men without charge or review by a court, simply because they lack a visa,"""" she says """"the detention policy has failed as a deterrent and succeeded only as a punishment""""
but the pacific solution has a certain elegant simplicity for bureaucrats and politicians seeking a quick fix it denies claimants the right to apply under australia more sympathetic refugee determination system, because they are processed off shore under stricter unhcr criteria
nor can applicants rejected in the pacific islands appeal to the australian court system, which has in the past tended to second- guess the refugee determination system even for those who do make it on shore, and are thus eligible for legal appeals, australia has narrowed the grounds for judges to determine what constitutes persecution
boat people who are eventually recognized as genuine refugees and released from detention are only eligible for three-year """"temporary protection visas,"""" which lapse once their home country is deemed safe again anyone holding such a visa who leaves australia, even on vacation, is not allowed back in more than , people have been granted the temporary protection visas, including hundreds of afghans who may soon face deportation now that their homeland is stabilizing
as a former prime minister, fraser says he is appalled by the politicization and bureaucratization of such a delicate issue
""""don't allow canada to go down the same track,"""" he implores in an interview """"we've been led in the wrong direction on issues of race or religion, any country will get grievous leadership if politicians follow the polls, because polls give you uneducated, ignorant answers""""
in fact, canada treatment of refugees is often cited as a counterpoint to the australian system both countries are sparsely populated, western parliamentary democracies with inherited british common law, but they diverge dramatically in their refugee and immigration programs
in , canada welcomed more than , refugees, three times as many as the , allowed in by australia in the - fiscal year given that canada population of  million is roughly  times larger than australia  million, it accepts twice as many people relative to its size
the non-partisan refugee council of australia found that canada accepted , refugees over the past decade, compared to , in australia one reason for the disparity is that australia system of refugee determination is much stricter in evaluating claims
one-third of all asylum seekers in canada are accepted in the initial stages, compared to less than one in  who applies in australia in the final determination, half of all applicants get into canada, compared to barely  per cent in australia, according to the refugee council analysis for 
but the key difference is that during the refugee determination process, the vast majority of asylum seekers in canada are released into the community and can look for work only those who are considered to be at risk of flight are likely to be detained even then, the decision is subject to independent review within  hours and again after  days
ian holloway, dean of law at the university of western ontario, recently returned to canada after teaching for several years in australia and was struck by the intolerance and insecurity he saw while abroad
""""it still the case that the average australian feels more threatened by the prospect of illegal migrants than the average canadian,"""" holloway says by phone from london, ont """"the optics are very different the australians are a lot closer to the problem than we are in this country""""
he says the use of people-smugglers to jump the queues offends australia sense of fairness but using detention as a deterrent and circumscribing the ability of asylum seekers to turn to the courts for redress - unlike canada, australia has no charter of rights to give non-citizens strong legal protections - politicians bend public policy out of shape to suit their electoral needs
""""maybe we are a bit too lenient,"""" holloway says of canada, """"but it not good law (in australia) because i don't think the perceived threat is a real one and it not acting as a deterrent""""
but if desert detention camps don't deter people, isolation in remote pacific island camps may be giving them second thoughts immigration minister philip ruddock boasts that his hard-line approach is finally bearing fruit and makes no apologies for closing the door to what he calls people-smugglers and queue jumpers
more than , boat people arrived in australia last year - more than double the number who come by air - and up from fewer than , in - but since he implemented the pacific solution last fall, the boats have stopped coming, ruddock says with evident pride
interviewed in his ministerial office, he says australia is one of the few countries, like canada, with a formal resettlement program that takes in the most deserving refugees in an orderly fashion
most of the boat people who come to australia had already found sanctuary in another country, he says from these safe havens - so- called countries of first asylum - they shop around for a more attractive final destination
rather than remain bottled up at a refugee camp in pakistan or endure an impoverished life in indonesia, they try to buy their way into australia once a claimant gains recognition as a refugee here, he has effectively bypassed the long waiting list for resettlement - because he already in australia
ruddock argues that australia is merely exercising its sovereign right to decide who comes into the country at a time when more than  million refugees are thought to be seeking relocation """"could canada take  million people as refugees, put them all on pensions and benefits and look after the lot?""""
ruddock can claim the support of most australian voters his liberal government was facing defeat at the polls until it made a crackdown the central plank of its campaign
""""in australian political terms, i don't think there'd be a government around that would be elected after having given away the refugee and humanitarian program to people-smugglers,"""" he says
indeed, australia political landscape offers some surprising twists
many left wingers who want the government to go easy on refugee claimants are the same people - primarily, trade unionists and environmentalists in the green party - who fear more generous immigration quotas will strain the job market or harm the ecosystem by contrast, many putative right wingers want australia to double its population in the next few decades to boost economic growth
helen hughes, of the centre for independent studies, a sydney- based think-tank, epitomizes the paradoxes the daughter of a world war ii refugee, she sat on a government advisory commission that called for greatly increased immigration quotas and travelled across the third world as a development economist for the world bank
now, she believes australia is seen as a soft touch by asylum claimants, who manipulate refugee advocates with their tales of woe
""""these asylum seekers are not refugees, they are mainly upper- income people who are buying their way on to the boats,"""" she says
""""they hate living in iran or iraq and who wouldn't? if the afghans (in australian camps) were all refugees - and not migrants - they would all be rushing back to rebuild their country""""
hard-liners like hughes argue that the global pool of asylum claimants is so big that only temporary haven should be given to the most deserving refugees, who should be sent back as soon as circumstances permit
married to a canadian and a frequent visitor, hughes warns that canada policy is """"all heart and no brain"""" and will increasingly be targeted by people-smugglers unless stricter measures such as mandatory detention are considered
""""it the only way to stem the flood,"""" she says
but the tough-love approach has antagonized erstwhile government allies like neville roach a pillar of the corporate community - he is chairman of fujitsu australia - roach resigned in protest this year as head of the government council for multicultural australia
four decades after he immigrated here from india, roach believes the country is regressing on the refugee question he accuses ruddock of demonizing refugees and, by extension, all immigrants and visible minorities like himself
""""taking in , to , asylum seekers is a trivial amount - we've coped with many more in the past,"""" roach says rather than managing a relatively modest increase, the government is pandering to prejudice with its alarmist rhetoric
""""just as you can bring the generous out by leadership, you can bring the prejudiced side out by leadership,"""" roach says
he cites canada as a model for multicultural harmony and frets that australia is descending into xenophobia
whatever the bureaucratic rationale for the detention process, there is no need to stoke public emotions or to stigmatize people by denying them permanent haven in australia, he says
roach says the temporary protection visas are a short-sighted response that will prove disastrous
ultimately, the policy will create a generation of outsiders unable to integrate into society """"they will get no english- language trainingwe set them up for failure and they'll become dysfunctional""""
and he says the immigration minister has no moral right to berate boat people for not following the rules
""""for him, it all black and white but they're not `illegals' - that a totally incorrect word and they're not `queue jumpers' you can't have a queue of  million refugees""""
he asks why it wrong for asylum seekers to buy their way into australia with people-smugglers, when the government woos wealthy investors to come here by dangling the prospect of business visas
""""you can buy your way into australia,"""" says roach, whose advisory council paved the way for rich investors to get visas """"and that queue jumping""""
roach concerns about the soul-destroying effects of extended detention - and the consequent isolation - are increasingly evident at the villawood detention centre a -minute drive from cosmopolitan sydney, its residents live in another world
shah mohammad rahim is a -year-old doctor from afghanistan who has sat in the camp since applying for asylum in  rahim escaped from his hometown of jalalabad to peshawar in neighbouring pakistan and then paid people-smugglers $, to take him to indonesia and finally australia, on a false passport
but two years ago, refugee determination officials here rejected his claim that he was in jeopardy for criticizing the taliban he appealed his detention a half-dozen times on humanitarian grounds, but was refused
while waiting for an answer, he learned that one of his sons had drowned trying to flee afghanistan
rahim says he dreams of freedom again - back in afghanistan he has applied to return
with the downfall of the taliban, """"my wish is to join my family and to get out of this bloody place,"""" he says in a weak monotone
he is sitting hunched on a plastic chair in the yard of villawood, oblivious to the video surveillance and guard dogs that have been his constant companions for three years
australia gave him sanctuary, but not the right to settle here he was spared persecution, but has lived like a prisoner
the experience has left him a bitter and broken man rahim holds his bearded face in his hands as he confides that he is losing his memory, most likely because of the anti-depressants he is taking
""""they didn't save me,"""" he says mournfully """"if i had known what would happen in australia, i would have preferred to die in afghanistan
""""here, they torture us psychologically even if australia gave me permanent residency now, i wouldn't accept it""""

meanwhile in the star, lawyers for the gypsies charge that their clients are doubly victimized - discriminated against by the authorities at home and mocked by unfeeling immigration officers here in canada
there are not massive numbers of gypsies (or roma, to use the proper name) in canada indeed, most canadians probably think of gypsies in mythical terms, as exotic fortune tellers in full flouncing skirts
but in europe, they have had a bad time hitler equated them with jews as a people deserving of extermination and did his best to carry that policy out
even now, gypsies don't have it easy the bulgarian government tried forcible assimilation in , germany expelled , gypsy asylum-seekers back to romania
and the taint travels ``gypsies `exist on crime' '' headlined the toronto sun last week it's doubtful the sun would have run a headline reading ``jews `exist by moneylending' '' or ``irish `always drunk' '' but it seems certain ancient stereotypes remain socially acceptable
in fact, the gypsy refugee claimants who have arrived seem much like anyone else: restaurant managers, construction workers, people with kids nary a flouncing skirt to be seen
so why the fuss? relative to the total number of newcomers to canada, the czech gypsies are minuscule indeed, refugees in total are small beer
in , canada welcomed about , immigrants of these, fewer than , were people who successfully made a refugee claim
so far this year, the total number of czech gypsies claiming refugee status is  the total number whose claim has been accepted is 
this is hardly the stuff of which crises are made
even so, hard lines are being drawn to many conservatives, the czech gypsy arrivals are yet another example of canada's overly generous immigration system
among liberals, anyone who questions the bona fides of the czech gypsy refugee claimants is painted as racist
but how much of an argument do the czech gypsies really have?
presumably, this will be sorted out as refugee boards examine each case and it's worth noting that of the  czech gypsy refugee cases adjudicated over the past  months, only one was refused
but it is also worth remembering the united nation definition of refugees: people with a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' who cannot avail themselves of the protection of their own country
it's easy to see how this definition applies to people fleeing dictatorships or countries embroiled in civil war
but the czech republic?
since the end of communism, this country has been treated as a model democracy amnesty international does not refer to any czech human rights abuses in its  annual report in fact, according to amnesty spokesperson john tackaberry, the organization has never criticized the czech government's treatment of its roma minority
(by contrast, amnesty's  report criticizes canadian governments in at least four instances, including the ontario provincial police's shooting of chippewa dudley george at ipperwash park)
it's not that amnesty doesn't believe czech gypsies face discrimination, says tackaberry but his organization has found no convincing evidence that this discrimination is aided and encouraged by their government
even human rights watch, which is explicitly critical of the czech government, acknowledges that prague has condemned attacks on gypsies, proposed stiff penalties for racially motivated crimes and set up a special police unit to combat skinheads
all of this may make little practical difference to a gypsy being whacked by skinhead louts in the streets of prague but in a world awash with some  million refugees, most in truly desperate straits, it is an important distinction
for what the un convention on refugees tries to do is aid those who have no other recourse those who have, be they gays bashed in toronto or gypsies bashed in prague, are expected to deal with their troubles at home
with luck, canada's refugee adjudicators will be able to sort this out if ottawa finds evidence of widespread scamming, it would be wise to put visa restrictions on czech visitors - as it has done in many other instances
as for the overcrowding problem faced by metro hostels for the homeless: surely, the problem is not the arrival of  czech refugee claimants rather it is the homelessness that already exists thomas walkom's column appears on monday",Toronto Star,1997-08-25,1997,8,25

According to the report, fewer than one in 40 immigrants lives in a rural area with a population under 15,000, compared to slightly more than one in five Canadians who choose to live in tiny towns. The vast majority of immigrants -- about 75 per cent -- make Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver their homes.","  ottawa - where immigrants choose to plant new roots in canada appears to affect how much they earn, a new study on the economic integration of immigrants reveals
the statistics canada report, published friday in perspectives on labour and income, says that most immigrants settle in the places where economic integration is slowest -- in large urban areas even after taking into consideration their education level upon arrival, their ability to speak an official language, their admission class and country of origin, the study found that immigrants achieve income parity with canadians much faster in smaller centres
""""immigrants living outside the largest urban centres can translate their credentials acquired abroad into a relative income advantage more easily they are more likely to overcome their lack of ability in an official language, quickly learning english or french, enabling them to increase their ability to generate income faster,"""" statistics canada said
but despite the apparent advantages, immigrants are not small- town people according to the report, fewer than one in  immigrants lives in a rural area with a population under ,, compared to slightly more than one in five canadians who choose to live in tiny towns the vast majority of immigrants -- about  per cent -- make toronto, montreal and vancouver their homes
while those cities offer other benefits for immigrants, such as social and networking opportunities with other people from their home country, they appear not to help immigrants close the income gap with non-immigrants
immigrants in small cities or the countryside integrate quite quickly, especially when they have a university degree, statistics canada reports on average, immigrants with a degree reach income parity within four years in such areas, and immigrants with only a high school education tend to see better economic integration there as well, the report said
statistics canada used two measures to determine economic integration: the initial income gap between immigrants and canadians in general and the rate at which that gap narrows
for canadians in general, living in a large metropolitan area means a higher income compared to smaller areas -- but for immigrants, it the reverse

1718751355,"Final debate gets nasty; Party leaders spar over niqab issue, values in passionate exchanges",The issue of the niqab in Canadian citizenship ceremonies roared to life again in Friday's leadership debate with Tom Mulcair trying to fight his way out of a political corner by accusing the prime minister of using the issue for political reasons.,"  the issue of the niqab in canadian citizenship ceremonies roared to life again in friday's leadership debate with tom mulcair trying to fight his way out of a political corner by accusing the prime minister of using the issue for political reasons
the debate also featured a ferocious battle about values with liberal leader justin trudeau demanding stephen harper state once and for all whether he is prochoice harper retaliated by accusing him of setting a bad example to youth because the liberals want to legalize marijuana
in a passionate final debate, in french, before the oct  election, ndp leader mulcair, harper, trudeau and bloc quebecois leader gilles duceppe traded some of their nastiest barbs of the campaign over issues which had nothing to do with the economy
it was tva host pierre bruneau who opened the hot values issue when he asked harper whether he agreed with one of his party's candidates, gerard deltell, who referred to the niqab issue as """"candy"""" for the party in a close election campaign
harper responded mildly with a general answer about canadian values but seeking a way out of the quagmire the niqab has created for his campaign, muclair steered the issue into accusations that harper in fact doesn't really care about women's issues
""""what you are doing with the niqab is trying to hide your record,"""" mulcair blasted """"you use this as a weapon of mass distraction""""
""""mr mulcair, you are trying to change the subject,"""" harper responded """"your position is disconnected from the canadian reality"""" asked if he would legislate on the issue, muclair said he wouldn't spend a dime on such a plan even if he too is not at ease with veils
out of , new immigrants arriving a year, the issue of forbidding niqabs at citizenship ceremonies has affected exactly two people, he said
trudeau dove in, saying there are more men in the conservative caucus who are anti-abortion then there are women in niqabs in quebec
""""and since you are all about values, are you going to tell us tonight, for the first time, whether you are pro-choice or anti-choice?"""" trudeau asked
harper got in his own values barb over liberal plans to legalize the use of marijuana, saying as leaders they """"should set a good example""""
""""how are we going to protect our children if we put marijuana in corner stores?"""" harper asked
it was that kind of an evening if there was one light moment of the tense evening, it was when trudeau slipped up in french, referring to duceppe as """"mon amour,"""" instead of """"mon ami,"""" in a rapid-fire exchange on canada's place in the world
mulcair got offa good line in the segment too, accusing harper of thriving on conflicts
""""mr harper, you never met a war you didn't like,"""" mulcair said, adding the way to peace in the world is not """"dropping more bombs""""
the trudeau-mulcair clash started from the top of the debate and didn't let it up, with mulcair accusing trudeau of being in harper's pocket because the liberals voted for the budget and bill c-
when harper tried to attack trudeau for past liberal deficits, trudeau blasted back that the only years the conservatives didn't have deficits were electoral ones
""""you've been too long at  sussex,"""" trudeau said """"it's time for a change with you it's always somebody else's job""""
all three leaders sparred over the future of canada's supply management system, which is being discussed at the trans-pacific partnership talks in atlanta
""""i want to know if the supply management system will survive (these talks) intact,"""" duceppe asked, to which harper responded vaguely: """"we will preserve the system""""
the debate comes as the campaign enters its final stage and with voters starting to actually pay attention
and they are witnessing what is increasingly becoming a battle between the liberals and conservatives, with the ndp slipping into third place
the latest public opinion poll, by the leger firm for tva, the journal de montreal and le devoir, has the liberals leading nationally with  per cent support compared with the conservatives at  per cent and the ndp  per cent

1562614215,A joyous stop on my cultural road:   Celebrity watcher shares what Aga Khan Museum means to him,"Where there had been an element of concealment all those years when we gathered in schools - it was only in the evenings, the ghosts of the day-students ambling the halls - this was as prominent as the big glass dome that now sits on top of the centre, and looms, coquettishly, over the Don Valley Parkway.","  shinan govani, formerly a social columnist at the national post, is currently a contributing editor and celebrity columnist for hello! canada magazine as a shia ismaili muslim, he explains why the aga khan museum, opening thursday, means so much to him, his family and his community
expectancy built as i walked across a glazed courtyard with paths the size of tarmacs and the promise of an extraordinary garden come spring
here on wynford dr, the imminent arrival of his highness the aga khan for last friday's ceremonial opening of the ismaili centre and aga khan museum would surely be a trigger for jubilation
but when the man of the hour - the th hereditary leader to some  million ismailis around the world - appeared, a childhood memory from growing up in the suburbs of toronto intruded: one of watching blustery men roll and unroll carpets, weekend after weekend
the carpets would be laid, and then yanked, in clockwork motion and snakelike efficiency, at high schools rented by the congregation's powers-that-be
progressive yet devout, ismailis had, back then, only just joined the grander canadian quilt, with a good chunk of the community hailing from uganda
families like mine arrived here in the s after the mass asian expulsion, courtesy of idi amin that was the tipping point, in terms of settlement, for a clan that would in the coming decades welcome kindreds from all parts of the world, and would eventually number somewhere in the vicinity of , across canada and those high schools in north york and scarborough where the men furled and unfurled those carpets? we hunkered there largely because there were few, if any, built-to-suit gathering halls
that vision hung as i watched the aga khan officially launch the museum bearing his name - the first wholly devoted to islamic art in north america opening to the public thursday, and part of a gleaming new complex - one that includes both an ismaili centre, for spiritual contemplation, as well as a formal park, all of it designed by world-renowned architects - one certainly didn't need to reach too far to find the freight of the occasion
one generation in, and an entire climate-change, as far as inclusion goes where there had been an element of concealment all those years when we gathered in schools - it was only in the evenings, the ghosts of the day-students ambling the halls - this was as prominent as the big glass dome that now sits on top of the centre, and looms, coquettishly, over the don valley parkway a dome that, as the aga khan said on this day, symbolized """"the spirit of enlightenment at the heart of the centre's life""""
the prominence of the occasion was heightened, also, by the presence of prime minister stephen harper (he stayed for four hours!), as well as other command-performance dignitaries like justin trudeau as someone growing up in a time when we could never imagine that one of our own would become mayor of one of canada's largest cities - hello, calgary's naheed nenshi! - the opening of the museum was not about just bricks and mortar
it's an """"inclusion"""" that will pay it forward: the aga khan museum, reflecting the man who has always acted as a graceful bridge between the spiritual and material, aims towards gelling dialogues all around
there are a million immigrant stories in the city, each with its own winding roads and detours, but here's mine: somehow, some way, that kid, praying in a suburban high school gym, feeling like an outsider but on the hunt for connections in this new land, turned into the country's best-known social columnist
for more than a decade, it has been my job to cover the oscars, attend fashion shows in paris and new york, have lunch with robert de niro and dinner with madonna, interview everyone from that harry potter kid to beyonce in other words, star-struck is not in my current repertoire and yet, when i saw the aga khan, now  years old, in my hometown of toronto, star-struck is precisely what i felt all that stuff from childhood was coiled up in the occasion

353343207,THE KIRSCHBAUM FILE:   [Final P Edition 12 ],"During the next four years, 5,916 Czechoslovaks emigrated to Canada, including 1,500 Slovaks. Among the latter were the leaders of Tiso's government-in-exile. As [Joseph Kirschbaum] would later write, """"From the purely Slovak point of view, the contribution of this wave of Slovak immigrants was made particularly in the religious field and in the struggle for the freedom and independence of Slovakia -- a struggle never forgotten by the majority of Slovak Canadians. After the Second World War several leaders of the Slovak exile movement came from their ranks. After 1950, Canada became the centre of the Slovak political movement, since the most important of the Slovak exiled political organizations was the Slovak National Council Abroad, with headquarters in Montreal."""" Earlier, in Europe, Kirschbaum, [Karol Sidor] and [Konstantin Culen] had become acknowledged representatives of the Slovak refugees. By late 1947, Kirschbaum, on behalf of the Slovak League of America, was pressing refugee organizations for immigration visas for Slovaks still in European camps. Circulating among the camps, he worked tirelessly for displaced friends of the [Joseph Tiso] regime. Kirschbaum and Culen spent the next five years publishing a vast number of articles, books, pamphlets and petitions on Slovak history and Slovak politics in Canada and the U.S. In 1952 Culen, Tiso's former propagandist, became editor of Kanadasky Slovak, the largest Slovak newspaper in Canada. Kirschbaum was one of the main contributors, and the paper was edited exclusively by Slovak political exiles. It championed Slovak independence, defended the Tiso regime and was staunchly anti-Czech and anti-Communist. When Culen left Canada in 1958 and later died in New York, only Kirschbaum and [Ferdinand Durcansky] remained as the last direct link to the Tiso regime. By then, Kirschbaum and Stephen Roman were friends and allies. Kirschbaum moved to Toronto, took a part-time teaching post at the University of Toronto and became an insurance agent for Edgar T. Albert Ltd. Roman, after a mercurial career as a penny-stock speculator, had made an overnight multi-million dollar fortune in uranium mining. Both were admirers of Tiso, dedicated to Slovak independence, fiercly anti-Communist and devoutly Catholic.","chapter five: the canadian years
four days after nazi germany formally surrendered to the allies on may , , a small band of slovak nationalists met at a catholic church in toronto, ont wild, spontaneous celebrations had marked the end of the war in europe -- celebrations that these men were in no mood to share
they were led by an ardent, iron-willed -year-old immigrant named stephen boreslav roman, who had arrived in canada with his brother eight years earlier having grown up on a prosperous farm in eastern slovakia, the pair arrived with $, and bought their own small farm outside oshawa roman also took an assembly-line job at the nearby gm car plant in his spare time, the ambitious and industrious roman also became editor of a tiny slovak-language newspaper, studied english, law and economics and became chairman of the canadian slovak league, an association representing several thousand slovak-canadian immigrants it was affiliated with branches in slovakia and the us
roman and the other slovaks who met in toronto that day were devoted both to their church and to the dream of a sovereign slovakia the outcome of their meeting was an appeal, drafted by roman and the clerical president of the first catholic slovak union, to the canadian delegates attending the founding convention of the united nations in san francisco
""""whereas the small nations of the world have the right to life, freedom, independence and happiness,"""" the slovaks wrote, """"and whereas the slovak people are not czech people but a distinctly separate people and nation, and whereas the people of slovakia have been longing and struggling for complete independence, we therefore resolve and propose to the delegates of the world security conference that slovakia be granted complete independence from the czech nation or state""""
roman's appeal was flatly dismissed in both ottawa and san francisco well aware of the record of the tiso puppet regime, the allies had thrown their support behind the restored government of the pre-war czechoslovakian democrat eduard benes there would be no sovereign slovakia, the allies and the un made it clear, and tiso himself would likely be tried as a war criminal
the rejection of his appeal marked the beginning of an unwavering -year personal crusade that would make roman the leading financial and political patron of the slovak separatist cause in north america building a billion-dollar fortune in uranium mining, roman would develop extensive, high-powered political contacts soon such people as former canadian prime minister louis st laurent would be mingling with the remnants of the tiso regime's government-in- exile: joseph kirschbaum, karol sidor and konstantin culen, all of whom would arrive in canada with the help of roman's canadian slovak league all would arrive despite post-war federal passport laws that explicitly prohibited members of the tiso puppet regime from entering canada
as the prospect of an independent slovakia faded, roman's pleas to canadian government officials grew increasingly strident in september , he wrote on behalf of the canadian slovak league to an international council of foreign ministers
""""the canadian slovak league, horror-stricken by the unparalleled reign of terror which has taken place in slovakia since the benes- communist reoccupation of the country, implores you and the nations you represent to save slovakia and her people we deplore the sending of biased, anglo-american observers and correspondents who are definitely pro-czech anti-slovak in a matter like this impartial, if not decidedly pro-slovak ones should be sent to observe and report
""""in dealing with the slovak problems -- in the matter of the -  government's 'collaborational guilt,' in the matter of judging and punishing 'quislings, collaborators and political criminals,' in the matter of slovakia's and her people's legitimate desire for national independence, and the ensuing elections, let abraham lincoln's noble spirit towards the rebellious southern us states prevail, 'with malice towards none, with charity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds, to do all which may achieve a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations'""""
that plea too went ignored canada recognized the restored czech government as democratic until a communist coup in , and there simply was no """"reign of terror"""" in  what benes had publicly promised was punishment for proven nazi collaborators, including tiso and the slovak separatists who had plotted with nazi germany to betray prague in 
roman wrote again two weeks later
""""canadian slovaks, as represented in the csl, present this plea on behalf of the oppressed and exploited slovak people:
""""the slovak people are a nation with its own distinct language, its own culture, its own customs, with its own history and a definite national self-consciousness there have been many incontestable wrongs committed against the slovak nation by the one- sided, so-called 'czecho-slovak' democracy the wrongs recounted are typical of the dictatorial heel under which those slovaks, who dared to express their rights to live as a nation, were mercilessly crushed this the slovak nation cannot accept, because it means death
""""mindful of the appalling suffering and heroic sacrifices which the slovak people endured and still are enduring to obtain justice and freedom for themselves and humanity, we appeal to the great powers not to deny the slovak nation the right to speak for itself, to which it has a natural, god-given right it is for this reason that we are knocking at the heart of humanity
""""we condemn the arrest and obviously unjust forthcoming trial and condemnation of the slovak collaborationists and quislings, which is therefore  per cent of the slovak population, because  per cent of it favored slovak independence we think that the collaborationists and quislings who were in occupied and helpless nations -- like slovakia -- are wholly irresponsible and therefore, not guilty, because they acted under grave fear, duress, and brute german force""""
when the tiso war-crimes trial was announced, the canadian slovak league, with roman as chairman, fired off its final plea to save the nazi collaborator, a pamphlet entitled dr tiso's trial: perversion of justice
""""the members of the canadian slovak league, like all the slovaks of slovakia, are shocked and horrified at the unscrupulous, pre- decided, revengeful benes-communist trial of father tiso as canadians we ask our government and the united nations to protest and denounce this mockery and prostitution of justice and decency
""""father tiso is wholly innocent of any crime or incriminating act the dis-freedomed slovak people are clamoring for their beloved president's liberation, and for freedom and independence for slovakia from the czech nation, from communism, and benes who exploits and embondages, not the czechs, but the slovak nation by dis-industrializing it, by czeching its people and schools according to benes's concept -- similar to hitler's -- the superior czech race merits this
""""and please, do not seek confirmation of this from people of jewish blood until , czecho-slovakia was a paradise for their race, thanks to masayrk the founding czech presidentand benes masayrk's father was jewish benes, reputedly, is the head of world masonry""""
despite the inflated claims, however, neither roman nor the canadian slovak league spoke for all slovaks in fact, they represented a die-hard, hot-blooded minority both in canada and in slovakia itself, there were numerous other slovak organizations that supported the pre-war model of a semi-autonomous slovakia within a federated nation these groups covered the political spectrum and were represented in the  benes government some had been partisans in the  slovak uprising, some had spent the war in concentration camps, and some were jewish what they shared was a common revulsion at the atrocities committed by the tiso regime
the canadian government officially shared that view on oct , , the canadian immigration department formally notified the czech ambassador to canada that """"all passports issued by the former slovak state or tiso government will be considered invalid documents, and that any alien presenting such a document would automatically be refused entry into canada""""
that promise was backed up by a series of immigration department bulletins to offices and ports of entry across canada in , after consultations with allied intelligence offices in washington and london, that policy was reaffirmed it applied not only to war criminals but to nazi collaborators
""""under date of october / a look-out notice was issued re: slovak state or tiso government passports,"""" read a  canadian immigration branch bulletin """"the department is reliably informed that there are a number of aliens travelling on passports issued by the former slovak state or tiso government this government administered the slovak state when it was a puppet regime established by hitler, and has not been recognized by either the czechoslovak or canadian governments"""" another department of immigration bulletin was more blunt """"should the politically notorious adherents to the pro-nazi tiso regime now in austria apply for entry to canada, they should be refused a visa""""
on may , , the democratic government of czechoslovakia, recognized as an allied country, formally requested that joseph kirschbaum's name be put on the supreme allied """"wanted form"""" report for war criminals and security suspects the request, filed in west germany, obligated all the allied nations to send him to prague for trial if he was discovered but their reach did not extend to kirschbaum's refuge in neutral switzerland
while stephen roman and the canadian slovak league were appealing to the united nations to protect slovakia and the discredited tiso regime, the canadian government was relying on un-and allied- sponsored commissions to screen out the thousands of nazis and nazi collaborators hiding among the seven million destitute refugees huddled in post-war europe before , two of the most influential of these commissions considered those slovaks in europe who refused to return to czechoslovakia to be political criminals, not genuine refugees included in a secret """"list of persons inimical to the united states,"""" drawn up by the us displaced persons commission in frankfurt, germany, were former members of the slovak hlinka guards
the secret report described the hlinka guard as """"the military arm of the slovak people's party, organized along lines similar to the german ss the main function of this group after  was to serve as the political police of the hlinka party this party became an organ of the nazis in  and its members were champions of slovak autonomy after the munich agreement the hlinka party won autonomy by force, and backed by the germans, its leader tiso proclaimed slovakia's independence on march ,  many members of the hlinka guard worked for the german rshs heydrich""""
drawing similar conclusions about the tiso supporters hiding in refugee camps in austria, germany and italy, the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration and the international relief organization refused point-blank to endorse such people's applications to emigrate to canada and the united states that effectively excluded any slovak separatists from legally emigrating to canada before  and to the united states before 
by , the canadian government was being hounded to reverse its policy by stephen roman's canadian slovak league and by the architect of the  slovak pact with berlin, ferdinand durcansky as early as sept , , writing from paris to then prime minister mackenzie king, durcansky pleaded for canada to back the slovak cause in the united nations
""""i am persuaded that your excellency will not disappoint the hopes of the slovak nation, because canada was always the protector of human liberties the proceeding as if the slovak republic - never existed contradicts not only the principles of humanity's evolution, but also the accepted principles of international law""""
durcansky signed the letter identifying himself as the slovak minister for foreign affairs in fact, it was written on behalf of a self-appointed slovak government-in-exile composed of durcansky, kirschbaum, sidor, culen and tiso's former ambassador to berlin, matus cernak
durcansky had emerged at the end of the war a well-connected diplomat without a country in may  he fled slovakia, arriving at the austrian border with  pounds of raw morphine destined for the black market it was seized and he escaped capture only with the help of ernst kaltenbrunner, himmler's successor as head of the ss, who was himself destined to hang at nuremberg durcansky appointed himself head of the now vanquished """"slovak republic"""" and pressed for its revival in the united nations with token encouragement from fascist governments in spain and argentina, durcansky formed his slovak liberation committee and toured european refugee camps, building support among the , slovaks languishing there
at the same time, kirschbaum, his former student and personal secretary, began making his own parallel claim as a legal heir to the tiso regime now having no diplomatic status with the swiss government, he joined karol sidor in rome, along with tiso's chief propagandist, konstantin culen there they formed the slovak national council abroad they too pressed the slovak cause in diplomatic circles in rome, london and paris, built contacts among slovaks hiding in the refugee camps and looked for ways to escape the emigration embargo aimed at them
durcansky's letter, co-sponsored by the canadian slovak league, was deliberately ignored in ottawa writing later to the canadian ambassador in france, canada's secretary of state for external affairs, gl magann, supplied the blunt reason
""""it was agreed no reply should be made to the letter, but i think you may find the following information useful especially insofar as it concerns the canadian slovak league
""""the government of the slovak republic represents a group of slovak emigres who profess opposition both to communism and what they describe as 'czech imperialism' they are apologists for the tiso regime their 'minister for foreign affairs' has been president of the slovak liberation committee the corresponding organization in canada is the canadian slovak league
""""last year several communications were received from the canadian slovak league its spokesman, father zeman, was received by external affairs officialnorman robertson the attitude adopted by us is indicated in a memorandum by robertson, from which the following is an extract: 'i said i thought that the slovak nationalist movement had, for better or worse, been badly compromised by its collaboration with the nazis in setting up father tiso's government in the puppet state of slovakia no doubt a number of sincere, simple-minded slovak nationalists had supported this government in good faith but they could not expect the allied governments to have too much sympathy for them'""""
end eleven, more to come
c
anada's firm stand against allowing slovak collaborators into canada began to dissolve in  faced with international and domestic pressure to aid millions of refugees in war-torn europe and with a critical labor shortage, ottawa saw a new immigration boom as the answer setting up its own labor office in germany, canada's labor department began conscripting armies of refugees for work at canada's mines, power dams, factories, railroad and highway projects at the same time, a series of communist coups in eastern europe created a new wave of political refugees, including many from czechoslovakia given this huge volume of emigres, it was easy for former nazis and their collaborators to take advantage of the confusion and slip into the haven offered by canada and the us
during the next four years, , czechoslovaks emigrated to canada, including , slovaks among the latter were the leaders of tiso's government-in-exile as kirschbaum would later write, """"from the purely slovak point of view, the contribution of this wave of slovak immigrants was made particularly in the religious field and in the struggle for the freedom and independence of slovakia -- a struggle never forgotten by the majority of slovak canadians after the second world war several leaders of the slovak exile movement came from their ranks after , canada became the centre of the slovak political movement, since the most important of the slovak exiled political organizations was the slovak national council abroad, with headquarters in montreal"""" earlier, in europe, kirschbaum, sidor and culen had become acknowledged representatives of the slovak refugees by late , kirschbaum, on behalf of the slovak league of america, was pressing refugee organizations for immigration visas for slovaks still in european camps circulating among the camps, he worked tirelessly for displaced friends of the tiso regime
in canada, the canadian slovak league and the first catholic slovak union were also providing a list of proteges they would sponsor for immigration to canada at first, tight security on all czechoslovak immigration applications remained in force, but under relentless pressure the canadian immigration department soon gave way
the campaign was led by the league's secretary-general, father fero zeman """"the condition of the slovaks, wandering about europe, is by far more pitiful and cruel than that of any other racial group, including the jewish,"""" zeman wrote to ottawa in  """"the reason for this is that the slovak refugee has been considered by the iro as a collaborator of the priest-president father tiso penniless, starving, emaciated, unable to get any assistance, he is most desperate -- a wretched piece of humanity""""
after repeatedly turning up at the ottawa immigration offices and sending a barrage of pleas to the minister of labor, zeman sent the minister a list of  slovaks whom the slovak league wanted to bring to canada from european refugee camps all, zeman said, had been interviewed and cleared by the league's own """"social committee"""" in germany that committee turned out to be kirschbaum's slovak national council abroad writing in typical style, zeman bolstered his demands with a letter to the canadian consul in germany on feb , 
""""i have a hunch that czech-communist drenched persons in europe presenting themselves as czechoslovaks are on the verge of putting a fast one over on you as a canadian immigration official unless you are wary and on your guard,"""" zeman's letter began """" the fact of the matter is that thousands of fine slovakians are stranded in austria, germany, italy etc as oppressed political refugees many more are joining these wretched outcasts, and others will continue to join them as long as slovakia (that portion of europe peopled by slovaks from time immemorial) is under foreign heels
""""as such, slovakians should feel insulted, belittled to be asked to accept 'credentials' from czechs or any other form of fraudulent, deceptive, slovak-annihilating monstrosity whether these openly admit asiatic-communist leanings or not
""""slovak refugees in europe should be aided and encouraged to belong to the branches of the slovak league, the slovak catholic federation, and especially, the slovak national council abroad these three organizations should be expected to speak for, and to give credentials to slovakians no other non-slovak, particularly anti-slovakian group, should be allowed to!
""""do not fall prey to czech or other slick 'pan-slav' propaganda-- actually asiatic-semitic- communism -- which claims that slovakians are collaborators and fascists""""
zeman failed to explain that the leaders of the slovak national council abroad had all been recently convicted in czechoslovakian courts of treason kirschbaum had been sentenced in absentia to  years' imprisonment by a communist people's court in may , although the evidence and charges had been assembled under the democratic government of benes in  karol sidor and konstantin culen received the same sentences for betraying the democratic czechoslovak republic durcansky, sentenced to death for his role in setting up the nazi puppet state, had fled to fascist argentina
in another  letter to a canadian cabinet minister, zeman wrote, """"i note with interest that of the , persons who came to settle in canada in the last three years, , are of jewish ethnic stock may i humbly suggest that from now on -- for a few years -- more consideration be given by canadian authorities to the problem of easing the pressure so persons of slovak ethnic and linguistic origin may likewise easily leave various dp and refugee camps in europe""""
the canadian slovak league's torrent of appeals was backed up by the montreal-based first catholic slovak union it provided its own list of  """"slovaks who are refugees from czech-hungarian central european communism all are splendidly behaved christians, and excellent prospects for canadian citizenship""""
deluged and intimidated, ottawa finally let down the barriers to slovak immigration in a  memorandum, the immigration department acknowledged that european refugee agencies, not to mention ottawa, were being swamped with names supplied by the canadian slovak league to relieve the administrative burden, it recommended setting a quota for slovaks, then allowing the slovak league to supply it with its own choices
that, of course, delighted the canadian slovak league hundreds of slovaks began arriving on immigration ships included were former members of the tiso administration and army buoyed by the victory, the league began pressing, through the vatican apostolic delegate in ottawa, for help in bringing to canada the last, most controversial slovaks, led by karol sidor
after the war, sidor had remained at the vatican, where he had been slovakia's representative during the tiso regime it was he who had proposed expelling all of slovakia's jews to russian manchuria in  and who had boasted in : """"i have only one duty in prague, and that is to liquidate the centralist regime itmade us associate with red spain, atheist russia, and jewish geneva even in prague, i wear the uniform of the hlinka guard, for i want to look like an honest young slovak in matters of foreign policy, i want a policy of collaboration with all nations which oppose bolshevism and judaism""""
in august , the vatican representative wrote to prime minister louis st laurent, """"considering the delicacy of the situation, it is not opportune for mr sidor to protract his residence in the vatican any longer, while on the other hand he cannot settle down in europe without undergoing serious inconveniences and vexations""""
sidor, a known fascist and anti-semite, could no longer stay in the vatican after being briefed on sidor's past, the canadian prime minister instructed his reluctant immigration department to issue a security clearance by the time sidor arrived in , his rome- based colleagues, kirschbaum -- who had landed in halifax in november , sponsored by a founder of the canadian slovak league - - and culen, were waiting for him in montreal that december, they would be joined there by ferdinand durcansky
on dec , , the british foreign office picked up durcansky's trail when he applied for a visa to canada in london the allies still held a look-out list for war criminals, and durcansky's name was on it the canadians were alerted by the british foreign office and given a profile of the man who had cut the infamous deal with hitler and betrayed prague
""""durcansky, the leader of the most radical group of the hlinka party, established contact with seyss-inquart and burkell in vienna in october , and in february , entered into secret negotiations with hitler and goering concerning the future of slovakia shortly after durcansky, backed by the nazis, returned to slovakia as the first foreign minister of the new independent state
""""he  was  forced to relinquish his post in july  he remained, however, a useful tool of the germans as vice-chairman of the slovak-german society until he left slovakia with the retreating german army in  in  he turned up in paris, and, allegedly as a result of a meeting with eva peron, obtained an invitation to settle in argentina there he formed the slovak liberation committee, devoted to opposing the idea of czecho-slovak co- operation
""""durcansky was placed on the list of war criminals wanted by the czechoslovak government because of this, and because of his record, we have taken steps to insure his visawill not be extended, and that no further united kingdom visa will be granted to him
""""we have been advised separately that durcansky is trying to get slovak leaders to join forces with him so that the slovak movement would be under his direction the foreign office saw his main slovak contact in the uk and made it clear to him that durcansky was not in the uk with the approval of uk authorities they suggested you may wish to take similar action with respect to sidor, who is really the main slovak leader outside slovakia, and resides in canada""""
though they had been forewarned about durcansky and knew the numbers of his argentine passport and of his scandinavian airline ticket, canadian immigration officials failed to stop him when he landed at dorval airport in montreal on dec ,  he was given a three-month, non-immigrant visa discovering their mistake soon after, the canadian immigration branch alerted the rcmp and london
""""dr durcansky was permitted to enter canada before it was possible to have the information you forwarded made available to immigration officials,"""" canada's secretary of state for external affairs wrote to london in february  """"however, the rcmp has been notified of the particulars of the case""""
when durcansky left canada that spring, after a christmas reunion with his fellow slovak separatists, it was clear he could never return but two decades later, with the help of stephen roman, he would arrive back in toronto for a final rendezvous with joseph kirschbaum
for the first  years after the exiled slovak leaders arrived in canada, they pursued their crusade with undiminished intensity embraced by the canadian slovak league and a new generation of immigrants from the slovak clergy, they quickly became prominent speakers at slovak dances, religious celebrations, ethnic festivals, picnics and cultural events
the theme of slovak independence was always dominant, and few speeches or meetings failed to note the martyrdom of joseph tiso even in , kirschbaum would write, """"in the eyes of the slovak people, president dr tiso and members of the slovak government were condemned and executed, not as war criminals, but as symbols of slovak independence tiso's condemnation and execution cannot be justified from the political and moral point of view""""
at first, karol sidor assumed the head of the exiled slovak government, with kirschbaum and culen as his lieutenants in munich, that government was represented by tiso's former ambassador to berlin, matus cernak durcansky, deciding it was impossible to restore the slovak regime from buenos aires, soon joined cernak in munich
after sidor's illness and death in , kirschbaum became the leader of the slovak exiles that same year the canadian slovak league organized a huge banquet in ottawa """"in honor of the canadian government"""" the guests included prime minister louis st laurent and  members of the house of commons kirschbaum gave the keynote address in french
that summer, a delegation from the slovak national council abroad presented to the us state department a long memorandum, written by kirschbaum and sidor, pleading for slovakia to be recognized as a nation however, memories in washington were long enough to recall that only eight years earlier the tiso regime had been an official enemy of the united states kirschbaum's appeal was ignored
kirschbaum and culen spent the next five years publishing a vast number of articles, books, pamphlets and petitions on slovak history and slovak politics in canada and the us in  culen, tiso's former propagandist, became editor of kanadasky slovak, the largest slovak newspaper in canada kirschbaum was one of the main contributors, and the paper was edited exclusively by slovak political exiles it championed slovak independence, defended the tiso regime and was staunchly anti-czech and anti-communist
also included in the impressive output of kirschbaum and culen were many scholarly, carefully researched papers, books and articles on slovak history, language, religious customs, folklore and music the two were dedicated archivists of slovak culture and soon gained an impressive reputation among slovaks and other east european ethnic groups culen conducted painstaking research into the history of pre-war slovaks in canada, and kirschbaum later incorporated culen's work into his own book, slovaks in canada
when culen left canada in  and later died in new york, only kirschbaum and durcansky remained as the last direct link to the tiso regime by then, kirschbaum and stephen roman were friends and allies kirschbaum moved to toronto, took a part-time teaching post at the university of toronto and became an insurance agent for edgar t albert ltd roman, after a mercurial career as a penny-stock speculator, had made an overnight multi-million dollar fortune in uranium mining both were admirers of tiso, dedicated to slovak independence, fiercly anti-communist and devoutly catholic
it was a bond that would last until roman's death this spring
end twelve, more to come
in , after  years of exile, the slovak separatist cause was beginning to falter badly
many of its key leaders and writers were now dead, and many of the post-war slovak immigrants became increasingly immersed in the politics and culture of their adopted home in north america memories faded, and the stony reception the remaining slovak separatist leaders got from western governments brought little hope of victory
""""the prolonged exile and unfulfilled dreams of an early return home damped the ardor of the council,"""" kirschbaum wrote later in his book slovaks in canada """"the organized activity of the first post- war years became weaker with every passing year and the changing international situation some members of the council did not abandon the struggle, but the activity has been increasingly less organized, and was replaced by individual efforts of the council's leading personalities"""" those leading personalities would soon narrow down to kirschbaum, durcansky and stephen roman
in , faced with a demoralized and dissipating army of exiles scattered across canada, the us, argentina, south africa and australia, the two remaining slovak separatist factions merged kirschbaum's slovak national council abroad and durcansky's slovak liberation committee met in new york, formed the slovak liberation council and presented yet another futile petition to the united nations
durcansky's presence in the united states, however, caused a minor diplomatic uproar long before the conference the truman administration had twice refused, after being briefed on his history, to grant durcansky a visa to the united states one  document, written by the european director of the allied joint commission, summarized durcansky's past this way:
""""the slovak liberation committee is an extremist group whose members are largely ex-nazi collaborators head of the movement is dr ferdinand durcansky, now living in munich, the formerminister of the interior in the slovak autonomous government created and fostered by hitler according to german foreign policy documents, he assured field marshall goering that 'the jewish question in slovakia would be solved as in germany'
""""after the war he fled to argentina to escape a war-crimes death sentence, but was able to come to germany in  the slovak liberation committee is the smaller of the slovak separatist movements and has little support among slovak groups in the us the committee has no publication, but dr durcansky is a frequent contributor to a monthly paper, published in english and german, by a grouping of some of the worst fascist and nazi elements of the emigre movement""""
joseph kirschbaum described durcansky's post-war activities differently """"the slovak liberation committee was the first slovak political organization after the second world war which attempted to organize not only slovak political refugees, but all slovaks on this side of the iron curtain for a struggle against communism and for slovakia's independence under the courageous leadership of dr durcansky, the activities of the committee reached even the paris peace conference, and later the united nations and the government of the united states""""
when the news leaked out that the eisenhower administration had granted durcansky a visitor's visa, new york's czech immigrant community erupted durcansky was denounced by czechs, anti-fascist slovaks, us senators, such radio commentators as walter winchell and union leaders durcansky's speeches in new york and chicago, marking the th anniversary of the birth of the nazi puppet state, opened old wounds between immigrant czechs and slovaks and between slovaks and slovaks
in canada, kirschbaum was far more circumspect in  he and stephen roman, together with members of the canadian slovak league, formed a slovak businessmen's association in toronto roman, now the personification of a successful immigrant, was named honorary president, kirschbaum vice-president at their first banquet, in february , the guest speaker was the federal minister for external affairs, paul martin sr later slovak league banquets featured federal and provincial politicians, including john diefenbaker, robert winters and allan maceachen
in july , martin spoke again at a slovak conference organized by kirschbaum and roman in his keynote address, martin said, """"the way in which slovaks have refused to yield to the ideologies which strive to supplant the principles brought by the two slovaksaints, at the same time rising above bitterness, has been a lesson in tolerance to all canadians"""" in , kirschbaum and roman travelled to new york to celebrate the th anniversary of the birth of tiso's puppet government there the slovak liberation council drafted and delivered """"an appeal to the free world"""" like past appeals, it was taken seriously by no government
the pair also went to the vatican, where they celebrated the anniversary, with papal representatives, of the ancient founding of the catholic church in slovakia kirschbaum was well known to the vatican from his post-war liaison with karol sidor as a crusader for the slovak separatist cause roman was known for his devotion to slovak autonomy and to the catholic church and as a generous benefactor of both he had donated to the papal herd a holstein bull and four heifers from his own prize-winning stock and had poured vast sums into the construction of slovak catholic projects in canada he had also underwritten the costs of a clerical newsletter founded by the priest who used to give him a private mass in slovak at his -room tudor mansion in toronto on sunday afternoons
kirschbaum, meanwhile, continued to work on the slovak cause in  he became president of the ethnic press association of ontario, an avowedly arch-conservative group which strictly excluded left- wing ethnic newspapers and championed the nationalist claims of dozens of east european groups such as the slovakian separatists roman financially sponsored the association the canadian slovak league's kanadasky slovak, edited in the s by konstantin culen, was a member paper and at one point depended on roman and kirschbaum for its financial survival
on a tour of roman's uranium mine, organized by kirschbaum, the association executive enjoyed a lavish luncheon laid on by roman there kirschbaum posed for an arm-in-arm photograph with then prime minister lester pearson
in , kirschbaum published his massively detailed history slovaks in canada, which blended scholarly research with a highly selective explanation of the role tiso's regime had played during the war this is his summary:
""""the slovaks were given a choice either to be divided between their neighbors, including germany, or to declare an independent state bound to adhere to german foreign policy since the relations between slovaks and czechs were strained, the slovak provincial diet decided unanimously for independence and over  states -- including great britain and the soviet union -- recognized the slovak republic and established diplomatic or consular relations with slovakia
""""during the war both these great powers and all the western allies changed their minds, however, and gave recognition to a committee of czech and slovak exiles in london which posed as the 'czecho-slovak government in exile' all attempts to pass into the allied camp at the end of the war as a nation independent from czechs were unsuccessful the resulting non-recognition of the slovaks as an independent state free from czech or any other rule, created a situation which prompted the slovak government and a majority of the population to remain on the side of germany to the bitter end""""
kirschbaum's  book, like an earlier history of slovakia he had written in , made no mention of the , slovak jews who were deported and exterminated in nazi death camps during the tiso regime it did, however, contain a glowing portrait of stephen roman """"the most important and spectacular contribution to canadian development of industry, finance and agriculture has undoubtedly been made by stephen b roman he overshadows the contribution of the whole slovak group, has no counterpart in other ethnic groups, and ranks already now quite closely with the nation's most successful and financially powerful canadians""""
in , kirschbaum, roman and durcansky tried to revitalize their crumbling cause by creating a new, more powerful global organization, the slovak world congress roman was the first president and its chief private financial sponsor kirschbaum became a leading spokesman and in-house academic the headquarters were later established in a suite adjoining roman's corporate offices in the royal bank tower in downtown toronto
in his opening remarks to the  founding convention of the world slovak congress at the americana hotel in new york, roman declared: """"we contend that the slovak question is an international problem and therefore we request that international justice be done in slovakia, justice that will be fulfilled in full democratic statehood we ask the blessing of almighty god in this undertaking"""" later, roman would tell cbc radio interviewer barbara frum, """"my ultimate goal is the freedom of slovakia don't get me into spy systems i work toward the establishment of the freedom of slovakia in all my extra hours, through legal organizations""""
in june of the following year, the slovak world congress met in toronto at the royal york hotel roman, kirschbaum and durcansky were the dominant personalities karol murgas, a key player in the  revolt and a leader in the hlinka guard, also attended roman's friend and conservative party ally, former ontario premier william davis, led a special candle-lighting ceremony to commemorate """"the union of slovaks throughout the world"""" that night, in a keynote speech laced with unknowing irony, davis warned about the fragility of democracy it was an eerie echo of the pre-munich speeches of eduard benes, the democratic president of doomed czechoslovakia and the avowed life-long enemy of durcansky, kirschbaum and roman """"don't let us fall into the pitfalls of smugness and overconfidence,"""" davis warned """"freedom takes many years to grow and only a few hours to die""""
at that same congress, durcansky delivered one of his last tirades against benes, who had died a broken man after his country had been betrayed first by britain and france at munich in , then by tiso's nazi-backed separatists in  and finally by moscow in  it was benes, durcansky claimed, who had started the second world war
""""it is certain today that one can blame only benes and his collaborators in prague for the creation of the situation which was advantageous to berlin as well,"""" durcansky told the congress """"he wanted to prevent the independence of slovakia -- even by war if necessary""""
next, durcansky reiterated his anti-semitic sentiments, which had remained unchanged by three decades and a holocaust that saw the murder of , slovak jews """"it is well known that the jewish element was concentrated mainly in the cities of south slovakia there is no doubt of the fact that that was one of the reasons for the growth of anti-semitism another reason was the unnatural economic and social situation in slovakia it is a well-known fact that, along with the czechs, it was mainly jews who had control of the entire economic life in slovakia
""""there existed, therefore, a certain parallel between anti- semitism and a just division of national wealth as a result, anti- semitism in slovakia had no racial, but exclusively political, economic and social roots racial elements were imported into slovakia from the reich i hope we live to see the time when the jews draw from these facts the necessary objective conclusions -- and they relinquish their anti-slovak policy""""
he had this to say about the allies:
""""the hostile, even malicious attitude of the allies towards the slovak republic during world war ii, and their constant activity in the interests of its destruction, have clearly proven that they did not intend to mend their discriminatory conduct, and that they were determined to consider slovakia only as an object of their unjust policy in the future"""" durcansky concluded by claiming, """"in the end, berlin learned to respect the independence of the slovak republic thus the slovak republic was not a creation of berlin but was just the opposite""""
durcansky died in  without returning to canada, but his contorted version of history continued to influence the publications of the slovak world congress durcansky's death left joseph kirschbaum as the last leading figure from the tiso regime, and he was revered, along with roman, by the dwindling number of slovaks who still held allegiance to the dream of a sovereign slovakia
in , to mark his th birthday, kirschbaum's slovak admirers around the world agreed to produce a series of essays on slovakia and its turbulent political history these were collected and published as a full-length book subtitled essays on slovak history in honor of joseph kirschbaum the essays paint portraits of the tiso regime that are seldom less than flattering according to this book, the  break with prague was ordained by god and destiny; the pact with berlin was inescapable; the , doomed slovak jews were deported to death camps despite heroic efforts by tiso to save them; and the  partisan uprising was composed only of communist bandits
the introductory profile of kirschbaum makes no mention of his meetings with goering and gestapo officials in , no mention of his strategic role in the nazi-directed coup that brought tiso to power, no mention of his public celebration of the fall of france to hitler and no mention of the role his office played in the mass expropriations of jewish property in slovakia instead, karol murin, tiso's former secretary, tells the reader:
""""joseph kirschbaum is certainly among the first, if not the first politician to bring to slovak politics characteristically political methods politics has been the constant theme and motivating force of his life he was a successful diplomat, but he viewed diplomacy as applied politics

2165580080,Lack of loyalty why the left keeps losing,Aucun(e) disponible.,"why can't the left win elections? this question was raised in monday's national post in a bloomberg news piece by leonid bershidsky and i think the answer is that it has a loyalty problem
there are other possible explanations, of course including denying the premise and saying it can win, from justin trudeau in  to the us democrats in the  house elections but as bershidsky notes, the left is on the ropes in europe, where among other failures the french socialist party got crushed by an empty suit named emmanuel macron who now seems to be losing to nobody at all, while germany's social democrats are fading even as their chief adversary, angela merkel, does the same
meanwhile in north america, hillary clinton somehow lost to donald trump in  and a smart gambler wouldn't bet much on trudeau in , though better him than jagmeet singh or what's-her-name in ontario which makes short work of another alternative theory, that the left is losing due to the calibre of their opposition liberals didn't think much of ronald reagan but at least he had charisma and convictions
another admittedly polemical explanation is that left-wing policies don't work it didn't stop leftist parties from dominating politics in the industrialized world for most of the th century, but their habit of promising the moon then failing even to deliver green cheese might be catching up to them on the other hand, whatever intellectual vitality conservatism exhibited in the s, forcing """"neoliberals"""" to embrace markets and discuss civil society, has long since vanished, taking inspiring leadership with it
most liberals would reject the possible conclusion that the left is now essentially losing politically to itself, that the """"right"""" abandoned conservatism and stole its adversaries'big-government clothes but in that case what do they think is wrong? why aren't the democrats running the table in the united states if trump is as bad as they claim and, the new york times assures me, the government shutdown is causing voters pain while trump's wall is a fraud? ah yes the wall here's where i think the left has a serious, unrecognized loyalty problem exemplified by their delight in porous borders
i said delight in canada the trudeau liberals made a typically half-hearted and quarter-brained attempt to deal with our own refugee border issue before claiming they actually regarded uncontrolled immigration as an economic and social blessing and one is tempted to retort """"yeah, right"""" along the lines of the herman cartoon of the golfer's wife asking him """"did you mean for it to go in the lake?"""" but while it's easy to believe trudeau couldn't close the border to all but approved immigrants if he wanted to, it's hard to believe he wanted to
it's just not chic to take that view it's """"nativist"""" it's """"bigoted"""" it's not """"open"""" it's not cool but on this issue i don't think voters are very chic, just as i don't believe most americans share the times'hugely positive view of government, even if they like their handouts
here let me invoke psychologist jonathan haidt's excellent  ted talk arguing that when it comes to morality, everybody except sociopaths is deeply concerned with fairness and protecting the vulnerable but, haidt says, liberals value openness more than conservatives while conservatives place more emphasis on three other dimensions: purity, authority/respect and loyalty
i'm a bit suspicious about the first given the pc obsession with purity of thought and language, especially about sex where conservatives are meant to have the hang-ups but conservatives definitely worry more about authority, respect and social order (trump is the exception that proves this rule; his supporters enjoy his utter disrespect for the authority of an elite in open revolt against western civilization since the s) and from the cold war on, conservatives have been infuriated by liberals'apparent unwillingness to take their own side in an argument
from stalin to castro to chavez, liberals have applauded regimes that would have put them up against the wall in a heartbeat and on contemporary issues from immigration to terrorism, they don't seem to disagree with conservatives on how to enforce rules and protect our society but on whether to which profoundly alienates voters sympathetic on many other issues
in the short run i'm happy to see the left defeat itself because, for instance, implementing a socialist platform would be ruinous especially for the poor but i'd prefer higher-quality political discourse because stupidity is never helpful and a smarter, more self-aware left would force the right to up its intellectual game
on that basis i urge leftwing parties and thinkers to recognize that their visceral dislike of their own culture, civilization and history is politically harmful because it's morally wrong which in turn requires recognition that loyalty is a virtue

""""it's not the normal way of doing it, is it?"""" he says
he's not kidding, and he's not alone at this th edition of the toronto international film festival, which runs sept -, canadian filmmakers seem intent on breaking as many rules as possible
there's a rebel spirit filtering through the  canadian features and  canadian shorts screening at tiff , as seen not only in the actions of on-screen characters but also in the intent of filmmakers
perceptions, assumptions and received truths are under attack or up for debate, as their titles alone suggest: films like rebelle and revolution and i declare war
the stories behind canadian headlines are revealed to be more nuanced than first thought, in docs such as *, which probes sprinter ben johnson's  olympics disgrace, and show stopper:the theatrical life of garth drabinsky, which turns floodlights on a unique showman's fall from grace
when it comes to speaking the truth, nothing this year can top stories we tell, polley's personal documentary that is as direct as a blood transfusion seeking definitive answers for long-whispered family rumours, the toronto actress and filmmaker sets out to interview polley family members and friends, some of whom really don't want to talk
what polley discovered, and brings to the documentary screen through archival footage, dramatic re-enactments and almost surreal cross-cutting between personal testimonies, has had a profound impact on her life and those of many others
polley's revelations - which qualify as spoilers for anyone desiring the film's full impact - became a news story this week after stories we tell screened for critics in toronto and venice, in advance of its premieres at two major film festivals
that same day, polley posted a blog entry at nfbca, explaining why she's kept mum until now
she said she didn't want to make a conventional documentary, instead choosing a non-linear narrative that demands greater reflection she wasn't even sure she wanted to make the film at all but she persisted
""""making this film was the hardest thing i've ever done,"""" wrote polley, who previously penned and directed two dramatic features, away from her and take this waltz
""""it took five years and tormented me i didn't want to make it, and i wanted to give up many times along the way, but i also didn't want this story to be out there in the words of someone other than the many people who lived it""""
another uncompromising canadian is toronto's rob stewart, who follows his feature debut sharkwater from five years ago with revolution, taking his underwater environmentalist crusade further afield
this time, he's not just out to save vanishing shark species, but all marine life, which constitutes  per cent of life of earth
he travels the globe with his waterproof camera, capturing spectacular imagery that he uses to try to goad governments into taking action
he's angry that canada hasn't lived up to its official pro-environment stance canada signed the kyoto accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but hasn't lived up to it
""""canada is one of the worst countries on environmental issues out there,"""" stewart says """"the general impression among the public is that we are one of the good guys but we are not we signed these treaties, we didn't abide by them, and our emissions have gone up""""
quebec auteur denis cote uses almost total silence to make a similar indictment of how people treat the natural world in bestiaire, he visits a quebec safari park, where his documentary lens reveals how stares of curiosity and indifference flash between both sides of the cage
inspired by a medieval picture book and by our chronic disrespect for the natural world, cote's film insists it's really our minds that are caged
and also our bodies, as brandon cronenberg's antiviral would add cronenberg's feature debut bleakly satirizes a not-so-distant future where celebrity culture has gotten so out of control, rabid fans willingly infect themselves with the diseases of adored icons
the rebel spirit of canadian films not only asks what time it is in a rhetorical sense, it even questions time itself
peter mettler's the end of time poetically explores the human construct of hours, minutes and days, arguing that nature doesn't need watches, clocks and calendars
""""it doesn't matter what time it is,"""" a voice asserts
in , don owen created a classic of canadian cinema with nobody waved good-bye, with peter kastner's alienated teen kicking against societal rules he didn't accept
there's some of that same anarchic spirit in these tiff offerings:
kazik radwanski's tower, where derek bogart's -year-old nerd resists adulthood;
kate melville's picture day, where tatiana maslany's teen terror seeks love while fighting convention;
jason buxton's blackbird, where connor jessup's misunderstood goth kid can't even bring himself to enjoy hockey - and is there any greater act of canadian rebellion than that?;
kim nguyen's rebelle (war witch), where rachel mwanza's child soldier rejects violence while being forced to carry a gun;
anita doron's the lesser blessed, in which joel nathan evans' first nations teen struggles with a bully and the stresses of modern life
another strain of canuck insurgence is the refusal to accept the official story or explanation on any and all topics:
igor drljaca's krivina sets goran slavkovic as a bosnian immigrant to toronto, who wants a first-person explanation of war-crimes allegations made against a friend;
simon ennis's lunarcy! looks at the moon and asks why people can't live there, or at least vacation there;
sudz sutherland's home again shows the bitter results of an ill-managed deportation program that sent petty criminals """"home"""" to a jamaica they neither recognized nor embraced;
jamie kastner's the secret disco revolution humorously asks whether there was more going down on the dance floor in the s than just platform shoes and shaking booties
steve gravestock, tiff's head of canadian programming, says he can see rebellion even in the way directors are constructing their films many are rejecting three-act structures, linear narratives and complicated productions
""""it's a minimalist movement,"""" he said """"you can see it across canada, but it's centred in toronto particularly films like tower and krivina take a more formalist approach, which isn't that different from denis cote's feature films
""""antiviral is like that, too - the story is not fantasy but science fiction it's very much a way of looking in and intently considering the world it's a stare""""
but there are also smiles in the canadian films of tiff 
some good ones come in just seven minutes in jonathan williams' witty canoejacked, which plays with canadian symbols - there's even the cry of a loon
two escaping convicts in the northern woods steal the canoe of a fisherman, who refuses to allow them a clean getaway
he hops into the canoe with them, while the bullets of a pursuing guard ricochet about
the fisherman is missing one other thing besides his common sense: his pants naked from the waist down, he explains to the cons that he's a """"canoedist""""
""""i like the feeling of freedom!"""" he explains
he's in good company with the other canadian rebels at tiff

438931998,Duceppe courts the ethnic vote; 'You are part of modern Quebec' Bloc targets strong Liberal ridings:   [ONT Edition ],"By breaking into the multicultural communities in Montreal, [Gilles Duceppe] says, the Bloc can not only succeed in defeating Liberal MPs like Denis Coderre and Pierre Pettigrew, but it can also reassure Quebecers who are nervous that his party is ethnocentric and inward- looking. Early in the campaign, there was a long tour of the province, into constituencies in the Gaspe, the Lower North Shore and the Saguenay, where Bloc MPs are not threatened. Since then, Duceppe has been concentrating on the ridings he hopes the Bloc can win from the Liberals - on the South Shore, on the Island of Montreal and in the Outaouais region across from Ottawa. Ian Barrett for the Toronto Star Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe talks to voters in Montreal Thursday. The party hopes to make inroads in Liberal strongholds. Jacques Boissinot CP Gilles Duceppe learned he had become a grandfather for the second time while campaigning in Montreal Thursday. His daughter-in-law gave birth to a baby girl.","gilles duceppe is spending a lot of time these days on rue jean talon and boulevard st michel in montreal
over the last few days, he has been meeting algerian business owners, tunisian restaurateurs, haitian cab drivers, lebanese activists and leaders from a wide range of cultural communities
this is multicultural montreal, what duceppe calls """"le quebec moderne""""
and at bloc quebecois gatherings, you can now hear the aspirate swish of arabic and the musical intonation of haitian creole in the crowds
on wednesday, standing in a packed, ground-floor room of an algerian community centre, duceppe talks about the work the bloc has done with various immigrant communities
""""but we work with you as quebecers, because you are quebecers,"""" he says """"without exception everyone who lives in quebec is a quebecer you are part of this modern quebec""""
it is the message that he gives again and again - across montreal, in traditional liberal strongholds
the bloc leader began the day on wednesday meeting with his new montreal candidates, who include three of haitian background, a couple of middle-eastern background and one of armenian origin
he tells them that there is a new confidence and openness toward the bloc in these non-french, non-english communities
""""that very encouraging,"""" he says """"and it is very encouraging for all of quebec, because it gives confidence elsewhere, in quebec other regions, about the possible future of quebec""""
by breaking into the multicultural communities in montreal, duceppe says, the bloc can not only succeed in defeating liberal mps like denis coderre and pierre pettigrew, but it can also reassure quebecers who are nervous that his party is ethnocentric and inward- looking
the result, he hopes, will be a new identification with quebec rather than with canada
at a news conference, he cites a poll showing that  per cent of quebecers born outside the province support the bloc, but among second- and third-generation quebecers,  per cent support the party
the result is quite a different style of campaign
in ,  and , duceppe spent the bulk of those campaigns in french-speaking quebec and made only a few token appearances in ridings with strong ethnic communities
""""we've picked up this campaign where the last campaign left off,"""" says duceppe adviser pierre-paul roy """"in the last campaign, we went into some of these ridings at the very end of the campaign now, we have targeted them""""
there are some signs of success
hassan hassan is a butcher who came to canada from lebanon  years ago - and has come to a rally for maria mourani, a bloc candidate of lebanese origin who is running in ahuntsic riding against liberal incumbent eleni bakopanos
until now, hassan has always voted liberal this time, for the first time, he is voting for the bloc
when asked why, he says """"because of """" and turns to his - year-old daughter, douaa, and asks her to translate an arabic phrase
""""le scandale des commandites,"""" she says - the sponsorship scandal
ah yes, the sponsorship scandal duceppe and his candidates use it again and again mourani tells the rally that she really had not expected that kind of behaviour in canada
""""we are familiar with countries in other places where the government steals without worrying about it,"""" she says """"but we have the capacity to punish a government which has stolen from us""""
mourani tells the crowd that a bloc mp goes to ottawa """"to defend his country, quebec"""" but not all of those who have come out to support her will necessarily go that far
hassan, for example, says he likes the bloc social platform and its position on the middle east (duceppe says that the bloc is for the equality of palestine and israel, living peacefully side by side), but there is a limit to his support
he brings his hand down like a butcher cleaver, as if to mark the line he will not cross
""""independence,"""" he says """"i don't support the bloc in that""""
jean-roch boivin, a veteran parti quebecois activist who worked closely with the late pq premier rene levesque, has come to the rally now retired, he recalls how levesque tried hard to win support in ethnic communities, but without success
""""duceppe is doing it much better than the pq,"""" boivin says """"times have changed; old stock quebecers are more open""""
but he is not surprised that new bloc voters like hassan will not necessarily vote yes in a referendum
""""we can't use this vote as a barometer,"""" he says
this is duceppe fourth campaign as bloc leader in , he had just been chosen leader when former prime minister jean chretien called the election, and it was an uncomfortable experience for him
that was when he visited a cheese factory wearing a hair net, producing an image that has lived on in hundreds of political cartoons
he ran a much better campaign in , but his attacks on liberal scandals did not stick, and the liberals gained ground, winning seats that the bloc had assumed they owned
the  election was easy, so smooth that reporters nicknamed his tour club zen, and wrote about how duceppe watched films in his bus
this year, there are some classic elements to the campaign that have been honed with experience
duceppe usually begins the day with an event in the morning - a meeting with candidates or a policy announcement - followed by an encounter with journalists then, after the tv reporters have had time to file their reports to the noon news broadcasts, there is lunch and an afternoon event, often followed by a second scrum where he can react to what other leaders have said
finally, there is often an evening event with supporters, where he pumps up their enthusiasm, tears into the liberals for corruption and scandals, talks about sovereignty and tells the party volunteers not to take anything for granted
early in the campaign, there was a long tour of the province, into constituencies in the gaspe, the lower north shore and the saguenay, where bloc mps are not threatened since then, duceppe has been concentrating on the ridings he hopes the bloc can win from the liberals - on the south shore, on the island of montreal and in the outaouais region across from ottawa
but despite the practice that has come from four campaigns in less than  years, there are still slips
""""duceppe is making little mistakes,"""" universite de montreal political scientist pierre martin says
martin notes duceppe campaign stop on tuesday, when he zipped up to an ice-fishing festival near trois-rivieres, and was embarrassed by the festival organizer who said he missed the sponsorship program since he lost $, when the martin government shut it down
duceppe, caught off guard, said that he supported a program for regional festivals, but not a sponsorship program that funnels money through advertising firms
nevertheless, a headline suggested duceppe wanted a new sponsorship program
in the past, duceppe has always been very discreet about his strategic goals this time, he has admitted that his goal is to get more than  per cent of the popular vote, something that no sovereignist leader has ever done (in , the bloc got  per cent and took  of the province  ridings)
but this may be in conflict with his other goal, of breaking through in the multicultural liberal ridings in montreal
it may be impossible to do both; the energy he is spending in montreal is not being directed to pumping up the turnout in party strongholds like saguenay or riviere-du-loup and recent polls show that the conservatives have gained strength in quebec, at the expense of the bloc whose support has slipped to about  per cent
but it virtually the only gamble he is taking in this so-far smooth and risk-free campaignquebec

born in india, bhatnagar was  by the time his family moved to a farm outside london, ont school in the tobacco-growing area wasn't without harassment for ``the only non-white'' in his local high school his family accepted some racial intolerance as the price of leaving their homeland
but he expected more from the army, especially from officers it started with ridicule, later violence ``they said my name was too difficult, so everyone including majors and colonels called me `smith' they all laughed they had no understanding that for an indian, pride rests on family lineage people will sacrifice their life or happiness for family honor''
at , bhatnagar has never told his father about the name switch or about being called ``little brown coolie'' and ordered to carry drinks to officers a few non-commissioned officers repeatedly put him on what they called to his face ``nigger duty'' - tasks such as peeling potatoes instead of the more macho assignments for others such as handling weapons
at petawawa, he faced physical danger he overheard some soldiers planning to give him ``a blanket party'' it means throwing a blanket over someone and pummelling him he had been badly beaten twice so he threatened back with his knife
``i carried a large military knife used by the gurkhas (a tough regiment in the british army) i always slept with it under my pillow several times i had to demonstrate my willingness to use it i said, `if i go down, one of you will come with me' ''
bhatnagar was in the military from  to  after recruit and basic training, he served with an armored reconnaissance regiment in st thomas for three years, then joined the regular armed forces surprisingly, he expresses some understanding of frustrations within the airborne ranks
``some of the people we vilify (for disgusting acts seen on the videos) are men who were committed to dying for their country in a canadian uniform they were recruited for combat based on their physical and mental toughness and aggression then they were sent to do peacekeeping instead'' however, the brutal  killing of a somali teenager by airborne members was ``a war crime, unacceptable under any conditions''
now a cardiac surgeon at sunnybrook hospital, bhatnagar says he would have become an army surgeon if he hadn't felt forced to leave the demeaning environment
still, he hopeful about canada future for visible minorities, even a military future for his coming first child ``it still an obligation and a privilege to serve in your nation armed services the military forces are typically the last to change, but i think they are changing''
at the airborne final parade, gen john de chastelain, chief of defence staff, spoke of learning ``lessons from our mistakes''
let hope the lesson is clear every country needs a backbone that defends against aggression or helps others restore peace but it must reflect its own society - and there no place for racism in ours today

at least nine resolutions are aimed at improving the lot of indians, including one which calls for wider consultation of aboriginal leaders, and another, which is a priority resolution, insisting on the repatriation of """"artefacts, regalia and human remains"""" now owned by collectors and museums
there will be a discussion on whether to prohibit water exports, a youth-wing proposal to negotiate a new post-secondary education arrangement with the provinces - similar to health allotments it would be called the canada education transfer - and another plan to make student loans income-tax deductible
among the other proposals setting up a plan to foster inter- generational farm loans, eliminating the gst on home heating costs, and reforming the employment insurance system to relax the criteria and establish an independent panel to set premiums (which the bloc quebecois has been clamouring for)
the party leadership will also hear calls to set up a government department for seniors, and tax breaks for retirees, as well as a new ministry of rural communities
the liberals will also debate new methods to increase the flow of immigrants, speed up the process of obtaining accreditation for foreign professionals, and a raft of law-and-order questions including stiffer sentences for illegal marijuana growers
there even a resolution calling on the liberals to mirror a conservative campaign pledge to ratchet up military spending to the nato average by 
and that not the only resolution that sounds familiar
calls for the government to spell out its plans for kyoto wouldn't be out of place at an ndp convention, and another proposal to provide guaranteed income supplements and hefty tax breaks for stay-at-home parents has also been championed by the tories
although there is scant mention of canada-us relations, there are a series of amendments on bread-and-butter party issues like aid to africa, national daycare, universal health care, multiculturalism, official languages, agricultural subsidies and a plan to compensate the beleaguered cattle industry

353019519,Defeat and shame have become staples of Canadian history:   [Final Edition ],"Never before has the CBC so perfectly reflected the nation as it does in its latest ad for documentaries about Canada at war. First shot: Dieppe, and boys dying for the folly of generals. Second shot: Japanese-Canadians being interned, victims of racism. In just 30 seconds, the CBC shows us all Canadians expect in their history: defeat and shame. To be fair, the CBC is also showing No Price Too High, an excellent documentary that rejects fashionable self-loathing. But the CBC - the same broadcaster that produced and aired the bitter The Valor and the Horror - steadfastly refused to show No Price Too High when it was first offered. The honor of premiering this great Canadian documentary fell to the American PBS. Compare the treatment of Japanese-Canadians with that of veterans of the battle for Hong Kong. Both suffered behind barbed wire - indeed, the Hong Kong vets were used as slaves, beaten, tortured and starved. Both were treated abominably by the Canadian government (the Hong Kong veterans lost their right to claim against the Japanese when our government improperly signed it away in 1951).","never before has the cbc so perfectly reflected the nation as it does in its latest ad for documentaries about canada at war first shot: dieppe, and boys dying for the folly of generals second shot: japanese-canadians being interned, victims of racism in just  seconds, the cbc shows us all canadians expect in their history: defeat and shame

this shouldn't be read as criticism of the cbc, however, which is just reflecting canadian reality we are a nation of amnesiacs who can only recall a few defeats and shames, or whatever events are relevant to the current politics of ethnic identity
compare the treatment of japanese-canadians with that of veterans of the battle for hong kong both suffered behind barbed wire - indeed, the hong kong vets were used as slaves, beaten, tortured and starved both were treated abominably by the canadian government (the hong kong veterans lost their right to claim against the japanese when our government improperly signed it away in )
yet the story of the japanese-canadian internment is a staple of high school history classes, tv docu-dramas, and novels - and the victims received compensation a decade ago the story of the hong kong veterans,, in contrast, is generally ignored in classrooms, and is of little interest to artists and their funding agencies
worse, the hong kong vets haven't seen a dime in compensation as the government pursues what seems to be a strategy of delay: wait long enough and they'll all die
or compare the treatment of two old adversaries, macdonald and riel
the lobby seeking to have riel declared a father of confederation, and july  made """"louis riel day,"""" has received all- party support in parliament
meanwhile, an association of history teachers lobbying for a """"sir john a macdonald day"""" has met with polite indifference
this is in keeping with the recent trend in which riel has become the sainted father, while macdonald has quietly slipped further into the bit part of the saint executioner the critical difference: riel life has everything to do with ethnic identity politics, macdonald nothing
perhaps more frightening than our amnesia and spotty recall are the cures so often proposed, which tend to be the cultural equivalent of hammer blows to the head: get rid of dominion day, victoria day, the monarchy and everything else that smacks of the past invent a new """"heritage"""" and new symbols history a great thing in the abstract, but the real stuff won't do make some more
almost always, these schemes are pushed by english-canadians or, more precisely, canadians of british ancestry that not a coincidence in the last few decades, english-canada stopped seeing itself as a tribe whose membership was defined by british ethnicity generally, this sea-change is for the better, since in its place we have a civic identity that doesn't give a fig for blood or skin color or other silly tribal markings
but along with this change has come a ridiculous conclusion: history that focuses on the old british tribe excludes other ethnic groups and so must be erased the dilemma is that the british tribe dominates just about all canadian history, so erasing it leaves little else the result: we remember events that emphasize ethnic minorities or that shame the general past, but all else is lost to amnesia
but has anyone ever heard ethnic minorities demanding this censorship of canada british past? no to the contrary, recent immigrants are bewildered that their children aren't being taught canadian history, which they consider to be their history
and rightly so vimy ridge, queen victoria and isaac brock are no less the history of a newly minted citizen than they are of a descendant of loyalists to suggest otherwise is to say that history is not a civic inheritance but is in the blood - which is patently racist
despite the odor of racism underlying it, the great amnesia project goes on history is sorted and culled according to ethnicity we are already near the logical end: a history that offers little for all canadians to share together except a few tales of defeat and shame in such sterile soil, nothing can grow",The Kingston Whig-Standard,1998-05-22,1998,5,22

extraordinary help at a traumatic time
re: highway  rollover results in serious injuries, oct 
thanksgiving will forever have a new meaning for our family just before noon, our son was involved in a single-car accident on highway  at dwyer hill, caused by an unexpected medical event
arriving at the scene, we were traumatized by the sight of the wreckage it was hard to imagine anyone could have survived that crash we were immediately overcome by the kindness shown by numerous motorists who had stopped to help our son, and who stayed to support us while the incredible emergency crews worked tirelessly to safely extract him from the vehicle and transport him to queensway carleton hospital miraculously, our son survived with only minor injuries
many thanks to opp const jonathan bigford for his professionalism and kindness both at the scene and in the days following the accident we truly wish we could thank each and every one of you personally, but sadly this is impossible emergency crews came from multiple unknown stations and we don't have names of the numerous good samaritans who stopped to help
to everyone at the scene and hospital personnel, we are sincerely grateful

it's time for a federal capital district
re: gatineau isn't getting its due in national capital, oct 
business professor ian lee convincingly outlines the discrepancy between ottawa and gatineau with respect to the broader federal presence being located in quebec, makes its location unique - but also problematic as far as being part of the national capital there is only one national capital of canada
the only real solution is to do what the united states did with its capital, washington it's not simply washington; it is its own governing district canada could (and probably should have years ago) declared the territory surrounding ottawa, including gatineau, as one legislative and jurisdictional district, so it could govern itself and be free of provincial and political restrictions, constrictions and contradictory circumstances
making both sides of the ottawa river one federal governing place, one capital of this country, would solve a lot of issues, including the reconciliation and integration of francophones as a vital part of, and into, the capital of this country

perhaps car owners are subsidizing non-drivers
re: who's really paying for parking in ottawa? oct 
the author argues that free parking at shopping centres costs those who don't drive a car a small surcharge on the products they buy at these malls that may or may not be true she does not offer anything to back up this guess
the volume of shoppers drawn in by access to handy parking may more than cover the added cost of providing parking it may make prices cheaper, benefiting all customers, as is usually the case with high-volume retail
there are close to  million cars in canada, driven on average , kilometres per year, using  litres per  kilometres of gas with each litre generating a gas tax of  cents per litre this generates more than $ billion in taxes, used to pay for all kinds of services enjoyed by drivers and non-drivers alike
licence plate renewals generate over $ billion per year there are multiple other fees and expenses paid by car owners that pad government revenues used for programs to benefit non-car owners under this author's ideology, should drivers be subsidizing non-drivers? should non-drivers not pay an extra fee called the walkers and cyclists top-up tax so that they can contribute equally? economics is a complicated science

make lrt contractors take public transit
re: two years after lrt launches, maintenance contractor commits to supervisory 'uplift' and better tools, oct 
while i understand that a massive project needs a year or so to get the kinks out of the system, the massive project of light-rail transit is kinking more than is acceptable
i am especially peeved with builder rtg and maintenance arm rtm, and their apparent nonchalance when it comes to deadlines, rider convenience and rider safety
i think they should be expected to only travel by oc transpo, bus or train, which will help them understand why their flip attitude is so galling
obviously not paying rtm has not produced the required incentive to get the mess fixed what other recourse do the city and the taxpayers have?

bezos's rocket didn't spew carbon dioxide

this letter claims that the blue origin rocket puts tons of co into the atmosphere, but it does not the blue origin rocket is powered by hydrogen and oxygen, producing water vapour as exhaust
producing the hydrogen and oxygen, and compressing them into liquid form, does take a lot of energy even if this is done using renewable green energy sources, this green energy could be put to far better use than launching space tourists for a -minute joy ride however, claiming that this rocket puts co into the atmosphere is incorrect, and environmental arguments should be accurate if they are to be taken seriously

excuse me? was elston's protest unlawful? no? then why do we have a public agency - not a private group - vilifying a lawful protest? canadians who value something close to """"free speech"""" have a responsibility to forcefully speak out against such instances of this slithering, venomous """"soft"""" totalitarianism now, before we are no longer able to do so

no canadian prime minister so enthralled and enraged the country as did pierre elliott trudeau, the jesuit-trained intellectual and romantic adventurer who died yesterday in montreal he was  years old
at times, admirers and critics alike were confounded by pierre trudeau was he a brilliant man of ideas who wanted to be defined by his actions#? were his ideas profound, or were they carefully crafted apothegms uttered for the tv cameras?
one defining comment on mr trudeau -- """"he haunts us still"""" -- was coined by his biographers stephen clarkson and christina mccall in , a decade after his retirement from politics
today, several hours after mr trudeau's death, that assessment - - he haunts us still -- seems more relevant than ever it resonates across the country as ordinary canadians come to terms with the death of a man who, as prime minister, was the most loved and the most hated leader in our history, often simultaneously
today, perhaps millions of us will look at the tv pictures showing the first flush of trudeaumania and find some confirmation of our own youthful energy and optimism for young canadians in the s, mr trudeau was a source of pride, his policies a force of national cohesion he was even endorsed by the beatles after meeting mr trudeau in , john lennon and yoko ono declared, """"he is beautiful people""""
""""if all politicians were like mr trudeau,"""" said lennon, """"there would be world peace you people in canada don't know how lucky you are to have a man like mr trudeau""""
but at times we felt cursed
mr trudeau's philosopher king aloofness often cast a shadow on his statesmanship his  years as prime minister -- - and - -- have been exceeded since  by only a handful of democratically elected world leaders yet he regarded the house of commons as a sort of boring sideshow its mps, he said famously, were """"nobodies"""" except on parliament hill
in the outpouring of trudeaumania in , one thing was certain canada had never seen a politician like pierre trudeau """"had there ever been in canada a national party leader quite like this?"""" historian roger graham wrote later of that era """"sir wilfrid laurier, let us say, sliding down a banister? sir robert borden in goggles and flippers? arthur meighen in a mercedes? mackenzie king at judo? rb bennett on skis?""""
clearly, there had not in mr trudeau, canada had a prime minister who broke all the political rules
mr trudeau's health had been in decline for many months in early september, mr trudeau's surviving sons, justin and sacha, issued a statement confirming that their father was """"not well"""" the crisis passed in a few days, but not before newspapers and television broadcasts carried adulatory reports of mr trudeau's life and times he had developed pneumonia on new year's eve, , and, according to friends, never seemed to fully regain his health he also suffered from parkinson's disease, a progressive illness, for the past several years despite his infirmities, mr trudeau had walked to work most days from his home on mount royal to his downtown law office he became ill after a summer holiday in new brunswick and maine in july  and did not return to work
the death of his son michel in november, , in an avalanche in british columbia, affected mr trudeau deeply the vibrant man who was still canoeing well into his seventies had grown frail and stooped in his last months
- - -
his undeniable charisma allowed him to capture the liberal leadership after barely a year in the pearson cabinet as justice minister, a post he occupied with great diligence and eclat, he caught public attention by reforming the criminal code and rewriting divorce legislation to reflect reality he was determined to distinguish sin from crime: """"you may have to ask forgiveness of your sins from god, but not from the minister of justice"""" he sorted out the seemingly intractable political problems of abortion and homosexual relations between consenting adults with a crushingly effective one-liner: """"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation""""
mr trudeau's public image -- part insouciant charmer, part icy logician -- was self-scripted, according to jim coutts, mr trudeau's principal secretary for seven years
his notorious pirouette at buckingham palace, in the presence of the queen, was a spontaneous, if rude, gesture -- or so most canadians assumed in fact, wrote mr coutts, """"he planned it for hours before because he strongly opposed the palace protocol that separated heads of state from heads of government the well- rehearsed pirouette was a way of showing his objection without saying a word""""
politics is usually a profession for the gregarious, but mr trudeau was not a gregarious man he was not a storyteller, and he could not tell jokes or recount a funny story in his speeches -- although he was often delighted by those who could, like former agriculture minister eugene whelan
mr coutts wrote of his failed attempts to inject a folksy element into mr trudeau's public pronouncements: """"i once tried to insert several jokes into his speaking notes and to explain to him how the jokes worked i said that humour depended on the timing of the punch line and that the punch line worked because it was out-of- kilter with an otherwise logical sequence of events or statements `but why would you want to mix up the sequence?' he asked
mr trudeau did enjoy campaigning -- up to a point
""""i didn't like to kiss babies but i didn't mind kissing their mothers,"""" he wrote in his memoirs """"i didn't like to slap backs or other parts of the anatomy i liked hecklers because they brought my speeches alive i liked supporters because they looked happy and i really enjoyed mingling with people, if there wasn't too much of it i think those who organized my campaigns realized that there are just so many hours and minutes a day i can spend in crowds and love it but after that point it breaks and i don't love it so if they didn't want me to start making faces and so on, they had to limit the time""""
as a student, mr trudeau had developed a powerful capacity to concentrate, an advantage he often used politically """"he often knew more about a cabinet item than the minister who put it forward,"""" mr coutts recalled """"his memory enabled him to savage questioners in the house of commons or journalists at a press conference he especially loved to rip into badly prepared premiers at first ministers' meetings it was satisfying, but not always politic he relished debate and was seldom outdone argument was his game he loved it, and he loved to win at it""""
the new orthodoxy is to revile the trudeau years as the cradle of all the iniquities that have come to canada in the past  years -- the lack of political consensus, the untrammelled growth of quebec's nationalism, the breakdown of """"family values""""
yet trudeaumania expressed a sense of collective optimism and hope, not the cynicism and self-interest that mark the post-modern political era
his passing evokes memories of inveterate intensity -- the war measures act, the election defeat of , his triumphant return the next year, (""""welcome to the s,"""" he roared in triumph on election night), the fresh rose from the governor-general's greenhouse fixed in the lapel of an elegant suit, the referendum battle with rene levesque, the patriation of the constitution, the verbal sparring with lucien bouchard after the second referendum in , his fierce opposition to both the meech lake accord and the charlottetown accord
columnist richard gwyn, author of the trudeau biography northern magus, feels mr trudeau haunts us """"because of his style, his elegance, his intellect, his fearlessness and his ruthlessness he teases, taunts, inspires and bugs the hell out of canadians because they know he is utterly un-canadian, but exactly what they want other people to think canadians are like""""
no other canadian politician retained the power to galvanize public opinion more than  years after leaving office
some historians have been harsh about mr trudeau's record in office """"the disappointment of the century  who left canada dramatically more divided and drastically poorer than he found it,"""" declared desmond morton in 
in his book misconceiving canada, political scientist kenneth mcroberts blames mr trudeau for """"bringing canada to the point of collapse"""" by his hostility to quebec nationalism, specifically the deux nations concept yet is is a """"profound irony,"""" he writes, that much of english canada embraced """"trudeau the self-declared anti- nationalist"""" as the """"saviour"""" of the canadian nation mr trudeau's strategy, although directed at quebec, had the effect of """"transforming english canada"""" through bilingualism, multiculturalism, and the charter of rights and freedoms, as well as the notion of the equality of all citizens and provinces
the title of mr trudeau's last book, against the current, tells us how he saw himself throughout his life, mr trudeau challenged the dominant ideology and disputed the conventional wisdom of the moment
""""this was true when he fought the oppressive regime of maurice duplessis in quebec,"""" as writer ron graham noted """"it was true in his years in ottawa, as justice minister and prime minister, when he introduced controversial measures ranging from wage and price controls and restrictions on foreign investment, to expanded rights for homosexuals and it has remained true since his retirement, particularly when he has taken issue with the more provocative expressions of quebec nationalism and with federal initiatives such as meech lake and the charlottetown accord""""
mr trudeau was implacably opposed to a """"distinct society"""" and the notion of special status for quebec, whether through a loosening of federal ties or sovereignty-association he believed the quiet revolution of the s had transformed quebec, and that francophones had proved they were capable of handling the political, economic, and cultural challenges of a modern society as well, he believed the """"siege mentality"""" of the separatists blocked the advancement of all quebecers and of francophones in other provinces
""""when i became prime minister, i always tried to move french- speaking canadians into posts they had never occupied in ottawa,"""" he recalled in  """"at one point, we had a french-speaking governor general, prime minister, chief of defence staff, head of the rcmp, minister of finance and so on we were establishing, to the delight of quebecers, that they could help run the country as well as anyone from ontario or elsewhere as for the defence of our language, we introduced the official languages act and the charter of rights and freedoms  and that's why i groan when i hear calls for special status, as though we need crutches because we're not bright enough or can't protect our own language well, you can't have crutches against the world you have to get out and fight""""
mr trudeau was  in  when he became prime minister in an election that seemed more like a coronation historian gordon donaldson has said that mr trudeau came to the liberal party """"like a stone through a stained glass window suddenly he was there""""
for voters just coming of age, mr trudeau was something like a hot new singer racing up the pop charts he personified cool at a time when being canadian meant """"square"""" to the world at large he was expo ', the times they are a-changin', peace and love and miniskirts and he could dance the frug without looking ridiculous
he turned up at the house of commons wearing sandals and a polka- dotted ascot, and in one famous photo, """"hanged"""" himself with a necktie -- the ultimate symbol of the grey, male establishment asked by reporters if he planned to give up his mercedes, mr trudeau shot back, """"which, the car or the girl?"""" then he said he wasn't about to give up either
in a letter to mr trudeau, media guru marshall mcluhan had burbled, """"you are immeasurably the greatest prime minister canada has ever had"""" but us president richard nixon once referred to him """"as that asshole trudeau,"""" an insult that failed to upset him """"i've been called worse things by better men""""
he became prime minister after two years in parliament and a year in the pearson cabinet typically, he shrugged off his lack of political experience
""""the further we advance into the modern age,"""" he said, """"the less important experience will become it's much more important to have the necessary adaptability with which to face and solve new problems""""

it often seemed that people in canada never really got comfortable with mr trudeau pollster martin goldfarb noted that while voters respected him, they never really liked him """"this is a country that loves loggers and hockey players that can fight, not philosophers and artists,"""" mr goldfarb is quoted in ron graham's book, one-eyed kings """"trudeau was truly an intellectual, and canadians didn't know how to handle him because he wasn't a part of their psyche""""
mr trudeau once summed up his style of governance: """"at certain times, on certain subjects, the government is either behind the people or in step with the people but i believe a government should also try to be slightly ahead of the people it must indicate the directions it thinks the society should follow for its future well- being that's what you might call leadership however, you can't be too far ahead of the people, too isolated, too dictatorial, or else the people will cease following you can't lead a people like you can a horse""""
yet mr trudeau in office did sometimes seem too isolated from the people -- and far too arrogant no other prime minster had dared to tell opposition mps to """"fuddle duddle"""" -- that is, f--- off mr trudeau's contempt was not always directed at politicians when protesters jeered him in salmon arm, bc, he raised his middle finger
on other occasions, he seemed to be giving the finger to the entire country """"i'm not really governing to be re-elected,"""" he once said """"if the canadian people don't like it, they can lump it""""
mr trudeau had guts on the eve of the  federal election, he was on the reviewing stand in montreal when the st jean baptiste parade turned ugly suddenly a bottle sailed across sherbrooke street and smashed near the stand the assembled vips scattered and ran, including quebec premier daniel johnson mr trudeau sat on alone when his two mountie bodyguards tried to shield him with a plastic raincoat, he brushed them aside the tv cameras captured it all, including the police who took a moment from clubbing drunks to shout """"bravo!""""
liberal strategists figured the incident was worth an extra , votes in toronto alone
and there was no one tougher than mr trudeau at the negotiating table during the  negotiations on canada's constitution, one of the provincial premiers told biographers stephen clarkson and christina mccall that the prime minister was """"so diamond-hard he glittered""""
historian michael bliss has noted how the liberal party's image makers """"liked to play up trudeau the gunslinger, jacket open, thumbs hooked in his belt, heading down main street for the showdown""""
but mr bliss argues that mr trudeau saw himself as a sort of modern-day coureur de bois: """"his own favourite metaphor, splendidly displayed in his television memoirs, was solo canoeing, coming in from the wilderness, returning to it by himself cincinnatus, the saviour of rome, had his plow; pierre trudeau, of canada, his paddle""""
mr trudeau earned his enthusiasm for the wilderness as a young man he spent two summers at a camp in algonquin park, mastering canoeing and learning survival in the bush then, as he recounts in his autobiography, he and three friends set off for hudson bay by canoe, retracing the path taking by radisson and desgroseillers in the th century
""""leaving montreal by lac-des-deux-montagnes, we followed the old voyageur route west along the ottawa river for several hundred miles; after mattawa we angled north and crossed lake timiskaming, then, after many lakes and rivers, reached the harricana river and followed it all the way to james bay then, after a canoe trip of at least  miles, we had to cross part of the bay to reach moosonee on the western side from there we were able to get to the canadian national railway's station in cochrane in northern ontario as for us, we hit the road and hitchhiked back""""

But it won't be passed in time for border officials effectively to intercept potential threats before they claim refugee status here. Once in the system, claimants are protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and by a lengthy appeal process that can take years to exhaust. Critics here and in the United States are particularly concerned about Canada poor record on deporting bogus refugees. Since 1995, more than 20,000 people have slipped through the cracks in the system. Many of those are believed to be in the U.S., where many millions, mostly Mexicans, live illegally. An overwhelming majority of illegal migrants are simply seeking a better life and pose no security risk. But that is little comfort for a country reeling from monstrous attacks perpetrated by a few fanatics or for its northern neighbour. The concern now is that those numbers will rise along with the threat to Canada if criminals with terrorist training and violent intent are flushed across the border in the coming weeks. Border officials are keenly aware of that risk, and refugee claimants trying to move to Canada from the United States will be closely questioned, particularly those with connections to 16 turbulent countries now on the Customs and Immigration """"watch"""" list.","canada is bracing for a surge in refugee claims as a massive police and fbi investigation into the sept  terror attacks forces thousands of people living illegally in the united states to flee
federal officials confirm privately that they expect canada will be the preferred destination they say proximity to the united states and this country controversial reputation as a safe haven will serve as magnets, particularly for those whose fake passports or assumed identities now make air travel too risky
while the size of the problem is still unclear, it is being compared to an old movie with more concern than humour, one informed bureaucrat said the potential exodus is reminiscent of a hollywood jailbreak: """"to escape the heat, you head north to the border""""
the security, economic and political implications for canada are significant a sudden influx of immigrants, some of whom may be undesirable, increases the risk of an attack here and would test an immigration system that is being heavily criticized in the united states
as part of the newly declared war on terrorism, washington is putting intense pressure on ottawa to tighten the border and harmonize policies controlling migrants
new, tougher immigration legislation introduced before the attacks on the united states is making its way through parliament but it won't be passed in time for border officials effectively to intercept potential threats before they claim refugee status here once in the system, claimants are protected by the charter of rights and freedoms and by a lengthy appeal process that can take years to exhaust
critics here and in the united states are particularly concerned about canada poor record on deporting bogus refugees since , more than , people have slipped through the cracks in the system many of those are believed to be in the us, where many millions, mostly mexicans, live illegally an overwhelming majority of illegal migrants are simply seeking a better life and pose no security risk but that is little comfort for a country reeling from monstrous attacks perpetrated by a few fanatics or for its northern neighbour
with more than $ billion a day in two-way trade at stake, canada is anxious to reassure washington that the border is secure enough to restore the free flow of goods and services that, after sept , became a trickle the arrival here of many more refugee claimants with dubious histories would only make that more difficult
security is also a rising concern on this side of the th parallel while far from panicking, security officials are worried that the current preoccupation with public safety in the united states, and this country close relationship with washington, make canada a more attractive target
officially, the federal government is saying as little about the security risk as it is about the alleged canadian connection to the assaults on the world trade center and pentagon
the public record, however, is more specific and more worrying
speaking to a special senate committee in june, , canadian security and intelligence service director ward elcock bluntly reminded this country that it, along with the united states, is one of the world pre-eminent terrorist targets
""""while i believe the (terrorist) groups active in canada are aware that we and our partners are competent, i am not so naive, and neither should canadians be so naive, as to believe that these groups will not act here if they conclude it is in their interests and if they see an opportunity to do so""""
as elcock noted then, its unique multicultural mix and notably open immigration and refugee policies combine to make canada particularly vulnerable at that time, csis was actively investigating  organizations and  individuals with terrorist links
the concern now is that those numbers will rise along with the threat to canada if criminals with terrorist training and violent intent are flushed across the border in the coming weeks border officials are keenly aware of that risk, and refugee claimants trying to move to canada from the united states will be closely questioned, particularly those with connections to  turbulent countries now on the customs and immigration """"watch"""" list
fortunately, interrogation has become more effective since the attacks intelligence since sept , mostly from electronic surveillance, has generated a list of about  people wanted for questioning in the united states
some of those, including former toronto resident nabil al- marabh, had previously been held and released by both canadian and us immigration officials so little was known about al-marabh, now considered a likely link to the us terror attacks, authorities had no reason to detain him
along with the failure to deport those without legitimate claims, that is a too familiar problem canada will now have to solve this country, at this time, cannot afford another embarrassing immigration incident
to avoid further straining relations with the united states, canada will have to effectively separate the potential security risks from the largely innocuous illegal migrants who are likely to flock here and then, in a break from tradition, it will have to detain and ultimately expel those with uncertain, suspect or shadowy histories
that is a time-consuming, expensive and often frustrating task but to do otherwise is now unthinkable",Toronto Star,2001-09-24,2001,9,24
436641422,Time for inquiry into police-minority relations:   [AM Edition ],"In most major Canadian cities, there are various programs focusing on police-minority relations. These include training, meetings with minority groups, visits to schools and employment equity programs. A federal judicial inquiry or commission on police-minority relations, empowered to delve into the related issue of how minorities are treated in the justice system, would provide a strong signal of the faith Canadians place in the concept of equality before the law. Such an inquiry should first rigorously review policing as well as the range of programs in the police-minority relations area. Recruiting, training, outreach, the commitment to minority issues in the federal and provincial solicitor general departments, the complaints process, and citizen review and advisory committees should all be scrutinized.","it couldn't happen here, right? we don't have the serious problems between police and minorities that plague american cities like los angeles
unfortunately, that's a comforting myth we'd do well to forget
canadians from minorities face problems that are simply not going to go away this weekend, another black youth was shot by a metro police officer in the past four years, eight black people have been shot by police in the toronto area others have been shot in montreal and ottawa
nova scotia's indigenous black community has had more than a few difficulties, as have native peoples in various provinces two chinese-canadians were beaten up by police in vancouver this february, los angeles-style other minorities have also faced their share of problems
almost every black parent lives with the fear that a son or daughter may be stopped and questioned or worse: shot for being in the wrong place at the wrong time
while police will say this is unfounded paranoia, there is no denying that it is the way many people in the black community feel; there is a growing perception a black person can be shot to death simply on suspicion of driving a stolen car
it is not surprising, then, that when a police officer approaches a black person, the latter may wonder if the officer is a cop or judge, jury and executioner
conversely, the stereotypes about blacks and crime propagated by american tv are widely blamed not only for helping to entrench the deep mistrust between police and minorities in canada, but for the knee-jerk displays of support for police among some in the dominant culture
in fairness to police, there are many chiefs and officers from coast to coast who are genuinely troubled by the current situation
furthermore, the police sector is doing more than any other part of the justice system to change and improve its services and bring its workforce up to date with canada's diversity
in most major canadian cities, there are various programs focusing on police-minority relations these include training, meetings with minority groups, visits to schools and employment equity programs
ontario, which has the highest concentration of minorities in the country, has revised its police services act to include mandatary employment equity for all forces in the province federally, ottawa has supported various training initiatives, and has just opened the new canadian police race relations centre, which will provide assistance to forces across the country
but despite the flurry of activity, police shootings are still happening and various minority groups continue to feel they are subject to harassment
a number of provincial inquiries have shed light on police- minority relations, but they have not provided tangible solutions there is a growing view among those concerned about race relations that the effectiveness of existing programs can be best evaluated on a national scale
a federal judicial inquiry or commission on police-minority relations, empowered to delve into the related issue of how minorities are treated in the justice system, would provide a strong signal of the faith canadians place in the concept of equality before the law
such an inquiry should first rigorously review policing as well as the range of programs in the police-minority relations area recruiting, training, outreach, the commitment to minority issues in the federal and provincial solicitor general departments, the complaints process, and citizen review and advisory committees should all be scrutinized
programs in place in various parts of the country would be compared, providing an opportunity for sharing information and for discussing initiatives such as:
community-based policing officers would forgo cruisers for beat work the benefits - getting to know the community and vice-versa - seem obvious
shifting from the current minority training approach in which police recruits spend a few classes talking in vague terms about cultural awareness, to a more active """"anti-racism"""" model which emphasizes how racism manifests itself on the job
the justice system at large must also be reviewed, as must programs that have an effect on the socio-economic status of minorities for example, federal cutbacks in transfer payments to the provinces mean that many immigrant children will get less english language instruction they will drop out sooner, have greater difficulty finding jobs and lose hope in their future
in recent days, prime minister brian mulroney has said riots like those in los angeles could happen in canada unless we can """"extinguish the instances of discrimination and unfairness"""" in our society a national inquiry into police-minority relations would be a good way to start

borrelli, in ward , is considered the most vulnerable he promised to support an auditor general, then voted against it, saying, """"campaigning is campaigning reality is reality""""
some of his statements have been downright bizarre
he advocated riding bicycles on sidewalks and asked for a """"morale index"""" to measure the impact on city employees of contracting out their jobs
and he harangues delegates at council meetings
retired banker jim morrison lost to borrelli by only  votes in the last election he entered the race late, with only his wife to help him he's running again, and this time, he says, he's more organized and will start campaigning earlier
""""i expect to mount a really credible campaign this time,"""" he said
he cited the need to address more quickly the continuing danger for cyclists and pedestrians on the underpass on dougall avenue and traffic jams at the intersection of dominion boulevard and northwood street
he also wants a bigger commitment to infrastructure despite record amounts being spent on roads and sewers
morrison says he won't be part of the voting blocs
""""i will vote based on what i hear from people, what makes the most sense, what's good for the community,"""" he said
""""but,"""" he added, """"i want to be more progressive""""
he would have kept commercial space on the ground floor of the pelissier street parking garage, and he wouldn't have nixed the wyandotte town centre's world marketplace, he said
ward  voted out incumbent al maghnieh last time after he was caught using his city credit card for personal expenses
""""will they vote out somebody for anything less?"""" asked council observer daniel ableser
this race will test the power of incumbency
but it will depend on how many candidates run there were eight last time the more candidates, the better the incumbent's chance people will vote for the name they know, and split the rest of the votes
payne, in ward , took on the windsoressex economic development corporation in , asking what it had accomplished but he'll be  by the end of the new term age never stopped hazel mccallion, the legendary former mayor of mississauga, who was  when she left office but it could be a factor
and kieran mckenzie, legislative assistant for windsor west mp brian masse of the ndp, lost to payne by only  votes in the last election, the smallest margin in the election he was windsor west mpp lisa gretzky's campaign manager when she toppled liberal cabinet minister teresa piruzza in the last provincial election he knows how to run a campaign
if he runs, the race will offer voters contrasting options: holdthe-line versus more progressive
ward , represented by elliott, got a cool and expensive new library, a new park by the river, a new roundabout and arch on sandwich street and a rebuilt college avenue it's undergoing a renaissance it has huge potential, but it's a struggling neighbourhood it needs a strong councillor elliott, born and raised there, runs the sandwich teen action group he's passionate about the ward but the consensus is he's in over his head
during a recent debate on street lights on banwell road, he misunderstood the motion and had to be corrected
ward  has the lowest voter turnout, so every ballot will count
candidate greg lemay says he wants to continue marra's work in ward  he cited the - votes and declared he wants to """"jump in there and switch some of those votes""""
he says he's part of a slate of candidates who will run against dilkens and councillors who support the mayor
bortolin's ward , one of the most high-profile wards because it's downtown, is up in the air if he loses in the provincial election, he'll run in the municipal election again his supporters are loyal so they probably won't begrudge his provincial bid if he wins the provincial election, sarah cipkar, the -year-old smart, no-nonsense dynamo from the downtown windsor community collaborative, says she'll """"definitely"""" consider running in ward 
""""i would really like to see a lot of the initiatives that i have been working on for the last several years continue and flourish,"""" she said
the remaining councillors, fred francis in ward , chris holt in ward , ed sleiman in ward , jo-anne gignac in ward  and irek kusmierczyk in ward , are all expected to be re-elected
so do the math the out-of-favour four who often oppose the mayor will lose marra but keep holt, kusmierczyk and maybe bortolin if they lose bortolin, they could gain cipkar they could also gain mckenzie, morrison and lemay that's six council would be divided for another four years, but suddenly the votes would go the other way
it's also a lot of speculation three months before nominations even close
among the mayor and  councillors, all but two are white men there's only one woman and one visible minority yet visible minorities make up almost  per cent of windsor's population what council really needs is members who reflect the city they serve - the fourth most diverse city in canada ajarvis@postmediacom

i can see two ways to address this:

 provide translation service via appropriate computer applications portable translation devices for travellers have been available for years these applications could be developed jointly by government and industry this would help not only immigrants but travellers, too

it's easy to hate on newcomers
they are unlike us and yet remind us of ourselves - people we need to do the jobs we scorn, but, heavens, they'd better not get too uppity and succeed too spectacularly or we'll accuse them of usurping our inherited place in canada
so, expect a lot of tut-tut-tutting as public debate ensues over council's request that the province allow permanent residents to vote in municipal elections ahead of their attaining canadian citizenship
this would apply to local elections only these landed immigrants - holding onto their former nationality for myriad reasons - would still not be eligible to elect a premier or prime minister or member of provincial or federal legislature; that would still be the privilege of citizenship
a canadian passport and certain travel rights and access to certain jobs would remain the preserve of documented citizens
but, considering the local, community-based, fine-grained and generic essence of civic engagement and neighbourhood integration at the city and town level, it is advantageous to waive citizenship as a prerequisite for voting for mayor, councillor and school board trustee
that is an enlightened view many claim they can't even fathom the concept, much less support it
council approved the request by a - vote, after hearing how hundreds of thousands of torontonians contribute decades of sweat and social and real equity into toronto but cannot vote because they haven't applied to ottawa for citizenship
they may be more canadian in outlook and attitude and culture than the recent immigrants who swore allegiance to her majesty, but without the paper, they can't vote for school trustee
council is now saying that should change, a reform the province must approve before it can be implemented
there are issues if the ontario government approves what is a more tolerant and inclusive election regimen, it may have to implement the reform across the entire province, not just in areas that request it
secondly, this may mean landed immigrants may be eligible to run for mayor, city council and school trustee normally, someone who is eligible to vote is also eligible to run for office so, if the mayor can't fathom how a non-citizen could possibly vote, imagine the incredulity about such a person holding office?
activist desmond cole has spearheaded the drive for this reform
""""there are a lot of fears and anxiety and mistrust of newcomers,"""" cole said wednesday, following several appearances on talk radio """"some don't want to listen; they want to use this issue as a club""""
objectors seem to """"want the assurance we are not doing anything that erodes citizenship"""" the fact is, some , torontonians who are permanent residents but not citizens are shut out of the voting process now meanwhile, non-residents are allowed to vote if they own property in the city, no questions asked about their loyalty to the municipality
""""this is a conversation about building the city are we are better off with the voices of those who can't vote, or are we better if we leave them mute?"""" cole asks
consider this: only  per cent of eligible voters participated in the  municipal election, one of the highest percentages in memory some councillors are elected with less than  per cent of the vote it's a struggle to get residents engaged in local politics
a democracy that elects councillors with less than  per cent of eligible residents voting is lame and limp such a system cannot afford to shut the door on immigrants who might be inclined to participate in local affairs
let all torontonians vote for the mayor of toronto, city council and the school board it's a reform that could energize local democracy all across ontario

""""The Liberals have no chance. Even my mother's getting fed up, and she's a card-carrying member."""" """"The downtown core has its own political esthetic, its own sense of what's a good community, what's a good government, and the Conservatives don't fit into that,"""" says Myer Siemiatycki, a political science professor at Ryerson University. """"The NDP has a kind of urbanity about it, a commitment to cities as diverse and creative."""" The Liberal slideIt used to be such a simple equation. In election afterelection, both federal and provincial, Torontonians wouldtroop to the polls and elect Liberals, with just the odd NewDemocrat thrown into the mix. For Conservatives, the placewas a wasteland.But underneath that impressive Liberal record, the party'sshare of the popular vote has been in more or less constantretreat for the past decade. From a mammoth 60% in the2000 federal election, Liberal support has since beenfalling steadily - into the 50s and then the 40s beforelanding at just 35% in last spring's federal campaign.In the process, the Liberals have gone from winning all ofToronto's then-22 seats to just 6 of the current 23, and fromtaking 96 per cent of the city's nearly 4,000 neighbourhoodpolling divisions in 2000 to 33 per cent of 4,700 pollingdivisions in 2011.That decline came as New Democrats increasingly laidclaim to the central core of the city, from Beaches-East Yorkto Parkdale-High Park, with the Tories storming back inwealthy neighbourhoods.Both are trends that Premier [Dalton McGuinty] will have toreverse by the Oct. 6 election if he hopes to spend anotherterm governing at Queen's Park.","graphic analysis by catherine farleystory by kenneth kidd
carlo colantonio is holding forth on his verandah, in one of those west-end edwardian neighbourhoods where people spend a lot of time on their verandahs, chatting away, calling out to passing friends on the street
""""i think they're gone and buried,"""" he says """"they had their time""""
he means the liberal party, whose fortunes he's followed from the same front porch for decades mostly, that has meant watching his italian immigrant neighbours troop to the polls and elect grits with the regularity of church bells """"nobody votes conservative here,"""" says colantonio
but these days, they don't vote liberal, either
in this year's federal election, upstart new democrat andrew cash captured the riding of davenport with  per cent of the ballots, including colantonio's nor, in colantonio's eyes, was this an aberration he's convinced the ndp will prevail here again in next month's provincial election
""""i've called it every time,"""" he says """"the liberals have no chance even my mother's getting fed up, and she's a card-carrying member""""
for a party that once blithely assumed governance was almost a dictate of nature, it's been a stunning reversal
as recently as the  federal and  provincial elections, the liberals walked away with nearly every seat in the city not so earlier this year, when toronto sent just six liberals to ottawa, behind nine conservatives and eight new democrats
but this wasn't the electoral equivalent of a century flood, or even just the result of two stunningly inept liberal campaigns against stephen harper's conservatives
the how and why of the liberal decline are so complex and compounding that they may not easily be reversed just about every political development has worked against the party, from the tory wooing of immigrants and the inner-city ascension of the left, to the fading popularity of the green party and the redrawing of provincial ridings so they align geographically with federal ones
in the wake of that pressure, liberal dominance has been eroding through a series of federal and provincial elections - a cautionary sign for premier dalton mcguinty even if the most recent polls still put the liberals ahead in toronto but trailing the tories elsewhere
the liberal decline is amply evident in a series of maps on which the star plotted the results of every federal and provincial campaign since  by neighbourhood polling divisions (three are shown here)
what was once a sea of liberal red, akin to old maps of the british empire, has been turned into a frail patchwork of pink, the result of what looks like a pincer movement - the conservatives gradually marching in from the surrounding suburbs, the ndp rising up in the core of the city
in this year's federal election, the liberals managed to lose ridings in almost every conceivable way they were clobbered in two-way races against both the conservatives and the ndp they came out on the losing end of three-way races, again to both tories and new democrats
for liberals, it's an unfamiliar landscape, but one they'll have to transform if they hope to retain the keys to queen's park
it used to be that torontonians routinely sent progressive conservatives to queen's park and liberals to ottawa, as if that particular alchemy would best serve the city, or at least hedge against unwelcome developments from either capital
the federal and provincial wings of the parties were seen as more distinct entities, and they didn't always like each other
back when the big blue machine was running the province, ontario pcs generally looked upon their federal counterparts as hapless amateurs whose fringe elements were always making public pronouncements that alarmed even the livestock
in liberal circles, the flow of condescension was reversed, so it was hard to speak of a single liberal or conservative brand, unified in outlook and mission
it helped that federal and provincial ridings were geographically different you might vote federally in york east but your provincial riding was don mills, stretching farther to the north
that all changed when former ontario premier mike harris redrafted the electoral map to align provincial and federal constituencies gone was the geographic half-step of party difference, the federal/provincial divide becoming increasingly blurred
prime minister harper certainly has not been shy in parading his avid support of both ontario progressive conservative party leader tim hudak and toronto mayor rob ford, although the latter connection may yet prove toxic for the conservatives if ford's popularity continues its downward spiral amid drastic cuts to public services
the dissolving of federal/provincial distinctions also aligns with the kind of world mike harris's strategists always dreamed about, one of simpler electoral choices pitting left against right, with liberals mostly spectating from the sidelines
as it happens, the city's electoral map does look like it's headed in that direction, given the dual ascendance of conservatives and new democrats, although more so in the city's core, which has lately been painted consistently orange
""""the downtown core has its own political esthetic, its own sense of what's a good community, what's a good government, and the conservatives don't fit into that,"""" says myer siemiatycki, a political science professor at ryerson university """"the ndp has a kind of urbanity about it, a commitment to cities as diverse and creative""""
that includes support for government services and investing in infrastructure, both of which appeal to downtown voters
for conservatives, though, a more suburban toronto breakthrough has meant something else
tories used to fret that they could never form a majority government without quebec, but if the  and  campaigns taught them anything, it was that they now couldn't win outright without toronto, and the key to unlocking that was the ethnic vote
hence the party's  conference document, """"ethnic outreach: building bridges with ethnic communities and new canadians,"""" which starts with the proposition that """"new canadians and minorities still don't know/understand the conservative party""""
but not just any new canadians the conservatives believed (wrongly in the case of davenport) that older immigrant groups such as italians were irretrievably lost to the liberals
the emphasis instead would be recent immigrants, particularly south asians, in the belief that their fiscal conservatism and family values better meshed with the conservative platform they also targeted jewish voters in ridings like eglinton-lawrence, highlighting their staunch support of israel
such was the intensity of ethnic wooing that, inside the party, point man jason kenney was soon dubbed the """"minister of curry""""
the recruitment of more south asian and indo-chinese candidates came with no small bonus, since those communities have a legendary reputation for organizing, all but ensuring an increased turnout of favourable voters
it paid off in greater toronto, conservatives walked away with  of  seats in , dominating the immigrant-laden ridings of mississauga and brampton nine of those seats were in toronto itself, in ridings where the average immigrant population was  per cent
davenport wasn't among those victories, and it may be the result of changes in demographics and voting patterns that seem instead to have favoured the ndp in the city's core
colantonio's house may be just two blocks from the corso italia of st clair ave w, but the surrounding neighbourhoods, once dominated by italian immigrants, are now home to an increasing number of other ethnic groups, principally portuguese and latino, and young, urban professionals lured by still-affordable housing close to the core
""""if you want a global village, it's here, davenport,"""" says colantonio """"most of the old people have gone the people here are mostly professionals""""
as of , the most recent census data, more of the riding's labour force worked in business services alone ( per cent) than construction and manufacturing combined
the utter collapse of the green party also seems to have benefited new democrats in downtown constituencies in davenport, for instance, the greens went from  per cent of the vote in  to just  per cent last time out, with the departing voters - at least in that election - more likely to have returned to the new democrats
but siemiatycki also suspects the ndp may have been aided, at least downtown, by another emerging force: tenants
it was once axiomatic that renters were much less likely to vote than property owners, an aspect of voter turnout largely thought to favour the conservatives and liberals
yet when siemiatycki looked at municipal voting during the two elections of mayor david miller's reign, wards with the highest percentage of tenants increasingly had the highest levels of overall voter turnout
""""gone are the days when we just made the assumption that tenants aren't engaged,"""" says siemiatycki
long-term, this may even have consequences for the riding of toronto centre, which liberal politicians at both the federal and provincial level have long viewed as a kind of national platform from which even loftier political careers can be launched to wit: bob rae and george smitherman
all but surrounded by solidly ndp ridings, toronto centre has lately been home to a boom in highrise residential housing, much of it ultimately rental
none of this, however, explains what happened in scarborough-rouge river during the last federal election
it may be an area of relatively low family incomes, but home ownership amounts to a core value only  per cent of voters live in rented dwellings, roughly half the level of most toronto constituencies
it's also one of the dominion's most immigrant-dominated ridings, at  per cent of the population, where roughly half the people speak a language other than french or english at home
the conservatives did make gains here but it was the ndp's rathika sitsabaiesan who put an end to  years of liberal incumbency by racking up  per cent of the vote, becoming the country's first tamil mp
it helped, of course, that scarborough-rouge river reputedly has the greatest concentration of tamils outside of asia and that harper's ottawa had formally branded sri lanka's tamil tigers a terrorist organization
but something else might also have been at play, something that could yet help liberal fortunes in other ridings
in one of malvern's neighbourhood parks, there's a small plaque it tells about the man for whom it was renamed last year, maj abbas ali, late of the pakistan army, who immigrated to canada in the s and became involved in all sorts of community work
he founded the muslim welfare centre and halal meals on wheels, abiding by his personal motto: """"service to humanity is service to allah""""
the surrounding streets in malvern and morningside heights are these days a sea of election signs, liberal red and ndp orange vying for supremacy, with scarcely any tory blue in sight
none of which surprises -year old sitsabaiesan yes, she'll concede, the tamil vote was crucial in her case, yet she also thinks her volunteer work in the community, particularly with young people, played a role, and that, too, has a lot to do with south asian values
""""when i went to people's doors, they knew me,"""" she says """"in general, people from the eastern world - asia, indo-china - are fiscally conservative but very socially progressive, in the sense of being concerned about looking after the community""""
could that emphasis on community and helping the disadvantaged also point to a path back from the wilderness for liberals?
siemiatycki thinks it might: """"the more that rob ford is associated with what conservative governments do, there will be negative spillover to conservative candidates at other levels""""
fears of """"ford nation"""" and its electoral clout have rapidly given way to fierce opposition to, of late, the mayor's plan to overturn  years of waterfront planning and replace it with ferris wheels, malls and monorails
""""the ford factor is now negatively shaping people's perception of hudak,"""" says siemiatycki, """"and that's creating space for the liberals""""
what the maps show
every toronto riding is made up of polling divisions - the areas around theneighbourhood polls where, typically,  to  people vote the mapsshow which party won the most votes in each division the darker thecolour, the more decisive the win the changing colour patterns reveal: the predominant liberal red in  faded to a sporadic pink in in , the liberals received more than  per cent of the vote in ,polling divisions ndp support grew stronger in the party's traditional downtownstrongholds and by  reached far into the suburbs conservative growth hardened in affluent neighbourhoods like rosedale,forest hill, the bridle path and the kingsway - which in  had mostlyvoted liberal - and expanded significantly across the city, including inpoorer neighbourhoodscreating the maps: digital polling division boundaries were downloaded fromelections ontario and geogratis and combined with poll-by-poll results published byelections ontario and elections canada on the the web the maps were generatedusing avenza mapublisher gis software additonal sources: statistics canada, census, gp murray research, toronto star library, star data analyst matthew coledesign and graphics: catherine farley/toronto star

[Ronald Reagan]'s name is respected among Soviets not only for his successes on the international scene, but also because the success of the Reagan revolution in the United States emphasized the backwardness of Soviet society under [Leonid Brezhnev] and his elderly cronies. There is a widespread joke in the U.S.S.R. that it was in fact Reagan who appointed Gorbachev to his post. The joke has some merit _ the economic and military growth of the U.S. forced even the most orthodox members of the Politburo to accept Gorbachev into the leadership. He appeared to be their only hope for escaping from the mess Brezhnev created. Since the Second World War, the Kremlin has supported conservatives rather than their left-wing or liberal opponents. Winston Churchill was liked and supported over Labor opponent Clement Atlee. Moscow backed Dwight Eisenhower against Adlai Stevenson, despite the latter's deep sympathy for the U.S.S.R. In France the Soviets bluntly supported Charles de Gaulle against Fran@ois Mitterrand, then Valery Giscard d'Estaing and George Pompidou against him.","there are no bookmakers in the soviet union _ glasnost hasn't gone that far _ but the question of who will become the next us president is under serious discussion in moscow
a group of experts has been established at the prestigious institute of the us and canada to provide the soviet leadership with a prognosis of the presidential election
while the soviet media have achieved great freedom under glasnost, they are not yet free enough to express openly the conclusions or preferences of soviet think-tanks on the spectacular political show in the united states
but careful analysis of the soviet media and the privately-expressed views of opinionmakers lead to the conclusion that it is george bush whom the soviet leadership would like to see in the white house in 
the prestigious literaturnaya gazeta has published profiles of both bush and democrat rival michael dukakis
while presenting dukakis as the successful son of an immigrant, the writer of the profile _ reflecting official views, no doubt _ described the incompetence of dukakis in foreign policy, his cursory knowledge of the world and his inability to resist pressure groups
while this assessment does not reflect the true nature of the democratic candidate, the view expressed in literaturnaya gazeta shows that memories of jimmy carter _ with his appalling unpredictability and weakness _ are very much alive in the kremlin
the rapport carter developed with leonid brezhnev is also remembered in moscow _ at a time when everything connected to brezhnev is raising understandable hostility
''it is not the personalities of carter or brezhnev that are important in working out our policymakers' attitudes to the past and consequently to the candidacy of michael dukakis,'' a moscow political observer said ''it is just that we learned the lessons of the futile detente of the late 's
''we did overpower carter at that time but in the final accounting both countries lost''
the portrait of bush that appeared was far more sympathetic than that of dukakis bush was presented as a firm, stable leader who had made a serious contribution to us-soviet rapprochement
throughout the bush profile, one sees barely-hidden admiration for ronald reagan
western observers in moscow are often surprised and sometimes even embarrassed by the open admiration reagan evokes in the soviet union
reagan's name is respected among soviets not only for his successes on the international scene, but also because the success of the reagan revolution in the united states emphasized the backwardness of soviet society under brezhnev and his elderly cronies there is a widespread joke in the ussr that it was in fact reagan who appointed gorbachev to his post the joke has some merit _ the economic and military growth of the us forced even the most orthodox members of the politburo to accept gorbachev into the leadership he appeared to be their only hope for escaping from the mess brezhnev created
since the second world war, the kremlin has supported conservatives rather than their left-wing or liberal opponents winston churchill was liked and supported over labor opponent clement atlee moscow backed dwight eisenhower against adlai stevenson, despite the latter's deep sympathy for the ussr in france the soviets bluntly supported charles de gaulle against fran@ois mitterrand, then valery giscard d'estaing and george pompidou against him
why do the soviets support conservatives against those who might be considered their ''natural'' friends? nikita khrushchev put it simply: ''they are predictable, those rightwingers''
a french socialist commented soon after khrushchev's remark: ''the true reason the soviets support conservatives is that they are conservatives themselves''
a combination of all these reasons have also made the soviets predictable in their assessment and wishes for us elections they think, and hope, that bush will triumph

mr fisher, a reserved new zealand-born lawyer who lives in ottawa, is executive director of egale (equality for gays and lesbians everywhere) under his leadership, egale has grown from an informal ottawa-based group to canada's leading lesbian and gay rights organization with some , members
though not yet a citizen, mr fisher, , has helped bring about sweeping and controversial changes in canadian laws during the last five years, making his adopted country one of the best places in the world for homosexuals to live
""""john deserves a lot of the credit for the advances the lesbian and gay community has made in the last five or six years,"""" says philip macadam, an ottawa lawyer who has championed gay issues and employed mr fisher in the early s
""""he's got an amazing commitment and is a very hard worker we're damned lucky he's here""""
egale has taken on a number of legal challenges and enjoyed a string of court and legislative victories
these include a  amendment to the criminal code to increase protection against hate crimes, and a  amendment to the canadian human rights act to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground for discrimination
""""human rights, for me, are universal and transcend national boundaries,"""" says mr fisher """"everyone knows someone who is gay or lesbian, and a society that affirms diversity is one that benefits us all""""
in the  vriend case, the supreme court of canada forced alberta to rewrite its human rights legislation to extend protection to gays and lesbians, sparking a ferocious debate over how far unelected judges could go in striking down laws of elected politicians
in , in the m v h case, the supreme court of canada struck down an ontario family law barring gays and lesbians from seeking alimony when relationships collapse the landmark case effectively changed the meaning of spouse to include same-sex couples, and provided a catalyst for bill c- which was enacted last june
bill c- gives homosexual couples the same rights and benefits as married couples under  federal laws, including tax credits and pensions
though it stops short of sanctioning gay and lesbian marriage, bill c- attracted protesters to parliament hill who called it an attack on marriage, and was opposed by more than a dozen liberal mps as well as the canadian alliance
last month, the supreme court of canada handed a partial victory to a vancouver gay bookstore the court found the store was subject to """"overzealous censorship"""" by customs officers who routinely seized shipments of books egale had been an intervenor in the case, which may lead to relaxed restrictions on importing literature
however, the courts rejected the argument that customs officials be stripped of their censorship role, an issue mr fisher said egale will pursue with the federal government
as well, egale is an intervenor in a case currently before the supreme court of canada in bc college of teachers vtrinity western university , the bc college of teachers refused to approve trinity western's teacher training program on the basis that it is discriminatory because it requires students to sign a statement that homosexuality is a sin
mr fisher was born in auckland and grew up in an adoptive family, the youngest of three children his father was a high school art teacher, his mother a dental nurse
after earning a ba in math and a law degree, mr fisher came to canada in  to study at queen's university, where he completed a master's degree in international lesbian and gay equality issues while researching his thesis, he interviewed ottawa lawyer philip macadam, who offered him a job as a legal assistant in 
in , mr fisher began to volunteer at egale, and in , was named the first executive-director his salary is $,
he lives in the byward market with his partner of four years, jerome st denis, a -year-old theatre company director an enthusiastic singer, mr fisher is also president of the ottawa gay men's chorus
the next big battle will be marriage, says mr fisher, who predicts that within  years canada will officially recognize lesbian and gay unions
egale has initiated a case in bc seeking marriage rights, and expects to become part of another action by the metropolitan community church of toronto, which last summer launched a legal case by eight same-sex couples who applied to the city of toronto for marriage licences
the church hopes to chalk up the world's first legal gay marriages through a legal loophole: the publishing of marriage banns in churches the church married two couples last week, two men and two women if the ontario government refuses to register the marriages, the church will sue the government
mr fisher spoke with the citizen about his life and work
q: how did you end up in canada?
a: """"i had been involved in setting up a gay and lesbian lawyers' group in auckland and was interested in getting an international perspective on equality issues i had thought i would spend a year studying overseas and then go back to work in a law firm in new zealand i have landed immigrant status""""
q: you are now an eloquent speaker on behalf of gays and lesbians yet your mother sent you for speech lessons when you were a child why?
a: """"i talk too quickly and don't always speak clearly that's still the case and my mother says the lessons were the biggest waste of  bucks she ever spent my partner doesn't understand me and that's probably the secret of our relationship""""
q: did you go through a difficult period of self-acceptance and coming out?
a: """"i was  when i came out my family are very accepting now but it's been a process when i first came out to my mother she burst into tears every time she looked at me at the time i was growing up i had never heard anything positive about being gay or lesbian my mother was here when the m v h suit was released by the supreme court for the first time she actually began to understand what it is i do i don't think she found it a tremendous source of pride that her son tossed a legal career for gay activism""""
q: you recently met your birth mother what was that like?
a: """"it was always a matter of some curiosity for me although not a burning need i had a fortunate childhood my family was not wealthy but we had a very good home environment she tracked me down she's an american i visited her in seattle jerome and i travelled with her to alaska earlier this year and did a kayaking trip i told her i was gay in my initial letter to her and got a very positive response back""""
q: how did you become an activist?
a: one of the things that motivates me is seeing people treated unfairly i wasn't a particular asset to any legal firms because i spent all my time on files for people who didn't have any money and for whom i sympathized the corporate clients who actually paid the legal bills were of much less interest to me i also spent a year working as a judge's clerk for the auckland high court the judges were interested in doing what was fair and what was right""""
q: how does canada compare in terms of human rights for homosexuals?
a: """"very favourably i believe canada has the potential to become a world leader on equality issues for gays and lesbians in the united states, homosexual activity is still criminalized in about half of the states in iran you get the death penalty england doesn't have any kind of anti-discrimination legislation the scandinavian countries have to a certain extent gone further; they've had domestic partnership registration legislation for some years holland has just passed legislation enabling same sex couples to marry that doesn't come into effect until april so the services performed last weekend in toronto will be the first in the world if they are found to be legal""""
q: have you suffered discrimination or hardship as a result of being gay?
a: """"negative attitudes towards homosexuality impact everyone who is gay and lesbian even if it's not something overt like being fired when i worked in a law office or for the judges it was less easy to invite a partner to a work function or to have a partner's photo on a desk one time in new zealand i was hugging my partner when a crowd of teenagers came by and shouted `i hope you both catch aids and die' it was pretty awful""""
q: to what do you attribute the successes of egale?
a: """"i don't think anyone thought we would get as far as we have in five or ten years social attitudes are changing i do have strong faith in human nature and i think that people basically like to see others treated fairly i think many people are not necessarily hostile to gays and lesbians but are just raised with the stereotypes that we're all child molesters or that our relationships are not as committed the more the courts and government are willing to recognize gays and lesbians, the more open they can be with their lives, and the more others will see that the stereotypes are not accurate""""
q: what barriers still exist for homosexuals in canada?
a: """"denial of equal marriage rights, equal immigration rights, differential protection across the country, systemic and attitudinal barriers""""
q: why is marriage important?
a: """"marriage sends an important message about which relationships are valued by the state and which are not not all gays and lesbians would choose to marry, but nearly all gays and lesbians want the right to make that decision for themselves had i the choice, i would probably live common-law""""
q:what's the greatest threat to equality for gays and lesbians?

while it may be crass to draw up actual balance sheets on what each province gives and gets out of canada, the vancouver-based fraser institute has done so, and the results might just as well be shared
in , bcers, per capita, received $ more in benefits than they paid in total taxes to the federal government however, if the feds weren't engaging in deficit spending and we were paying sufficient taxes to enable ottawa to achieve a balanced budget, bcers would have been in a net loss position, minus $ per capita
quebec fiscal position is far rosier per capita, quebecers received $, more in benefits than they paid in federal taxes even in the theoretical balanced budget scenario, quebecers would have still come out ahead -- receiving $ per person more in benefits than they'd pay in taxes
clearly, it would appear that quebec derives more fiscal comfort from confederation than bc more cultural comfort too quebec has total control over its immigration policy while bc does not and canada has given quebec guarantees that its language and culture will be protected special funding for french-language training is available coast to coast there is no similar official support for chinese-language training which is more relevant for vancouver-area people
so why aren't there more sterles out there? why does quebec talk so often of shredding the maple leaf while bc stands ever ready to salute it?

``there the idea of cascadia, but the northwest states show no sign of detaching themselves from the us'' and on its own, bc has just  million people at the edge of a continent, so it hard to conjure up a national image ``the quebecois have much more a sense of being a nation, either in canada or outside''
also, in vancouver, half the population comes from somewhere else, notes resnick the community is not culturally cohesive and so, ``the deeper sense of identity is with canada''
resnick says it always difficult for members of a majority group like english-speaking british columbians to understand the mentality of a minority group as a result, there isn't much sympathy for quebec sovereignty push
true enough the lonely separatist from white rock asserts: ``i personally would vote for a bc separatist party perhaps then ottawa would start seriously thinking about how much more bc gives to the federation than the federation gives to bc''
a minority perspective, but one that speaks loudly and clearly of the frustrations many british columbians feel during this interminable referendum season

A Toronto-based independent research centre funded by the province and the private sector, it recently published a comprehensive study of children and youth (i.e. those aged 24 years and under) entitled The State of the Child in Ontario (Oxford University Press, 1991). The nine wide-ranging chapters cover such topics as child health and welfare, education, employment, habitat, child care and young offenders. It is intended as a reference for policy-makers, service providers, researchers and the like. With the exception of some statistical tables, the book is easily accessible to the ordinary reader. A child has no financial resources. Therefore critical aspects of life -- food and shelter, physical and mental health, educational opportunity -- are governed by the economic circumstances of that child family. One in nine families is poor, that is, has an income below Statistics Canada """"low income cut-offs"""" -- the poverty line. Fifty-three per cent of poor families are two-parent families, while 39 per cent are led by single mothers. The remaining eight per cent are male-led or other family types (defined in the study as """"extended families and family spending units with more than two adults""""). Although single mothers' participation in the work force has increased significantly over the last 20 years, the incidence of poverty among female-led lone-parent families has increased nationally, a reflection of the sorts of employment opportunities open to women, and the financial burden of child care. One major shift is the incidence of poor children in families headed by a person aged 15 to 24, from 23 per cent in 1973 to 41 per cent in 1986.","  if you were to listen to politicians, you'd conclude they did nothing but think about children constitutional reform: to save canada for our children free trade: to give our children better jobs and more material possessions environmental policy: to save the land for -- guess who? laudable, no doubt but it might be instructive to check out how well they (and we) have provided for our kids so far, before getting sold on the next round
the child, youth and family policy centre has done exactly that, at least for ontario a toronto-based independent research centre funded by the province and the private sector, it recently published a comprehensive study of children and youth (ie those aged  years and under) entitled the state of the child in ontario (oxford university press, ) the nine wide-ranging chapters cover such topics as child health and welfare, education, employment, habitat, child care and young offenders it is intended as a reference for policy-makers, service providers, researchers and the like with the exception of some statistical tables, the book is easily accessible to the ordinary reader
easily the most significant fact about ontario population of children has been its decline, both in real numbers and as a proportion of the total population in  there were  million; in  under  in  children and youth accounted for  per cent of the population and  per cent in  this year it reckoned at around  per cent more children than before live urban lives one child in five is an only child, and  per cent live with a single parent blended families are more common as divorce and remarriage increase immigrant and aboriginal children make up  per cent of ontario children

huge numbers of parents are in the paid work force two-thirds of women with children under the age of  work outside the home nearly  per cent with children under the age of three are in the work force of working mothers, nearly three-quarters work full- time the figures are slightly lower for single mothers if so many mothers are working, who is looking after the kids?
most families cobble together a combination of paid child care and the local school although licensed care is available at some work places, at child care centres, in churches and increasingly in schools, the vast majority of parents use an unlicensed caregiver subsidized spaces in licensed operations are at a premium unlicensed care is cheaper, in some cases half the cost cheaper, yes, but the neighbor around the corner is usually untrained, her operation meets nobody guidelines, and her care is not necessarily suited to the developmental needs of the child she may teach them nursery rhymes, but then again she may plonk them in front of oprah the difficulty is that no one watches her while she watches the kids
there is one discouraging similarity between the licensed and unlicensed alike: their work is ill-paid and undervalued the average full-time child-care worker in ontario earns $, consequently the average turnover rate of staff in facilities is about  per cent, not far off half there is no financial incentive either to take up this work or to stick at it, no job security, little chance of advancement the lingering question: what is the trickle-down effect on the children?
child care is notable for its unevenness and inaccessibility health care for children, on the other hand, is accessible, regulated, well funded and valued
health care professionals are highly trained and well paid but health care is only one of the determinants of our children health to assess that health, we need to look also at health status, risk factors (inherited or behavioral), poverty, housing and social isolation to put it another way, a good health system doesn't guarantee health
the study gets a bit bogged down in explanations about the difficulty of defining and assessing health however, it does point out several clear trends mortality rates have been steadily declining, especially among infants however, a child is twice as likely to die if he or she is born into a poor family, and native children are two to four times as likely to die as non-native children while the death rate among children is dropping, the level of health problems is high as many as  per cent of children are disabled, coping with attendant health and education problems drug use is down, but alcohol and tobacco use remain serious health problems the study points to a rise in the incidence of teen suicide, homicide and children mental health problems, especially among low-income families in families with incomes under $, it as high as  per cent
the book is studded with interesting, sometimes shocking, statistics as many as  per cent of aboriginal families living on ontario reserves have no central heating in their homes on any given day, ontario has twice as many young offenders in custody or detention as quebec or british columbia more teenagers than ever are working nine out of  teenagers are in the workforce each year at the same time as their numbers in the workforce are increasing, their real wages are declining
the big picture is that some kids are ok, but great numbers aren't there are tremendous disparities between children in mid- to high-income families and those in poor families childhood is a luxury that most can't afford for their kids it might be better if we stopped spouting platitudes about our children future and paid more attention to how they are living right now",The Kingston Whig-Standard,1991-07-15,1991,7,15

it's a familiar scene: an elderly neighbour falls, breaks her hip, and suddenly everything changes for her and the husband she cares for, who has alzheimer's fortunately for this lady, she has concerned neighbours, who rush to help
one takes her to the hospital, while others look after her husband over the next little while, this community, united by nothing more than neighbourly bonds, comes together to assist the elderly couple as they find their way back to a proper routine
this story, recounted by a panelist during an igenottawa event( https://wwwigenottawaca/ ) in june, may be similar to one you've lived through people fall down, lose their jobs, experience illness or death in the family, or have their roof ripped out by a tornado when these incidents happen, we gather and assist because that's what a community is all about: looking out for one another but what if there's no fall, no freak storm, no death? are we still there?
one of the pillars of the blue zones( https://wwwbluezonescom/ ) philosophy, as described in dan buettner's book of the same name about areas in the world where people live long and healthy lives, is that of the """"right tribe"""" healthy social networks - the human-to-human kind, not the ones on your phone - favour healthy outcomes in populations
how do we encourage more involvement across groups that don't necessarily have very much in common on the surface?
this is great news if you already have such a network around you but what about other people - immigrants or those who moved to ottawa recently, those who feel isolated because their family lives somewhere else, those who have difficulty making friends, those who find themselves on the margins because of mental health or disabilities or language barriers? how do we encourage more involvement across groups that don't necessarily have very much in common on the surface?
ottawa is a lovely tapestry of community groups - for example those that focus specifically on older adults the city runs four senior centres, and lists about a dozen more that are run by the community, in french or english it also offers  fitness and recreation activities( https://ottawaca/en/residents/recreation-and-parks/recreation-and-leisure-older-adults ) geared towards older adults in  community facilities
want to meet new people and try ukulele, pickleball or progressive bridge? there's a drop-in schedule( http://joinottawaca/seniors/facs/churchill/cal ) for that prefer a group visit to the museum or a wine degustation en français? retraite en action( https://reaactivigocom/program?p=&s= ) has you covered it could be doing more to be welcoming for some ethnic groups, as amy yee( https://ottawacitizencom/opinion/columnists/yee-heres-why-ottawa-needs-multilingual-signs-at-public-facilities ) has argued in the citizen, but there's a lot on offer
there are lots of ways for seniors to get active around ottawa
former chair of the economic council of canada judith maxwell now works with synapcity, an ottawa non-profit that encourages civic participation at the igenottawa panel, she made a crucial distinction between hard and soft infrastructure
hard infrastructure means things like hospitals and medical personnel needed to help older residents in their later years soft infrastructure means """"connections between people to make a difference in what goes on in the community"""" and those are up to us
""""there is a lot of potential for help in the community,"""" maxwell added but ottawa is """"not organized or prepared for what's coming - a big generation of people at the end of their life""""

240873480,Muslims' search for a common voice::   [Final Edition ],"For example, Tarek Fatah, of the small, but vocal, Muslim Canadian Congress, took umbrage that women and leaders from minority sects were excluded from the meeting. """"Many of these imams have preached against gays, women, mixing with Jews and Christians. We believe that the No. 1 step to extremism is the exclusion of women from all walks of life and the prime minister bought into the stereotype that Muslim leaders are primarily men,"""" Mr. Fatah said. Historically, Mr. [Mohamed Elmasry]'s Canadian Islamic Congress, which claims to be the country's largest independent Muslim organization, has been the most recognized group. It is probably the group with the largest national membership and Mr. Elmasry is a constant presence in mosques around the country. But some Muslim leaders say that the congress's basic weakness is that in the Toronto area very few groups are affiliated to it. Photo: Tyler Anderson, National Post / Tarek Fatah of the Muslim Canadian Congress argues that many Canadian Muslims don't attend mosque on Friday, the holy day, and so religious leaders don't necessarily represent the rank-and-file. 'The vast majority of Muslims are like all Canadians and the way to talk to them is not just through imams but in community organizations, parent-teacher associations and other such groups.'; Photo: Jana Chytilova, the Ottawa Citizen / 'The Muslim community is a greatly decentralized and no one can purport to speak for the entire community,' explains [Riad Saloojee], executive director of the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations.","  canadian muslims are grappling with how to protect their faith and preserve their diversity, writes mohammed adam from toronto
when prime minister paul martin met a group of imams in toronto last month to discuss terrorism, the first thing he wanted to know was: who represents canadian muslims?
the imams had no answer
the canadian muslim community is composed of diverse nationalities, ethnic groups and sects, so it's not surprising that islam in this country does not speak with one voice but in the post / world, islam has been under fierce scrutiny and many muslims are seeking a certain unity with which to address the issues confronting them
a recent statement condemning terrorism and extremism, signed by  imams from across the country, was part of the search for a strong unified voice in greater toronto, home to more than half of canada's , muslims, several hitherto warring groups and mosques are working quietly to form coalitions and reduce the cacophony of voices
canadians tend to see muslims as a monolithic group, but in truth the community is a cauldron bubbling with diverse, sometimes competing identities, languages, political agendas and religious practices it is a rich stew of liberal and conservative, of arab, asian, african and european
consider what happened in the immediate aftermath of the meeting with mr martin even on an important issue like terrorism, long- simmering differences boiled over into vicious name-calling the secular wing of the community accused the imams of being misogynists and homophobes who don't represent the majority of muslims, and it criticized the prime minister for coddling up to them in more conservative circles, some questioned why imams such as the contrarian aly hindy were not invited
for example, tarek fatah, of the small, but vocal, muslim canadian congress, took umbrage that women and leaders from minority sects were excluded from the meeting """"many of these imams have preached against gays, women, mixing with jews and christians we believe that the no  step to extremism is the exclusion of women from all walks of life and the prime minister bought into the stereotype that muslim leaders are primarily men,"""" mr fatah said
mr fatah argues that many canadian muslims don't attend mosque on friday, the holy day, and so religious leaders don't necessarily represent the rank-and-file
""""the vast majority of muslims are like all canadians and the way to talk to them is not just through imams but in community organizations, parent-teacher associations and other such groups""""
other muslim leaders dismiss mr fatah as a publicity-seeking secularist who rages against mainstream islam to attract attention to his fledgling group
riad saloojee, executive director of the canadian council on american-islamic relations, said that just because mr fatah has doctrinal differences with some imams doesn't mean he should to denigrate a significant effort to confront terrorism and extremism
""""the muslim community is greatly decentralized and no one can purport to speak for the entire community,"""" mr saloojee says """"but the  imams, those that signed the declaration on terrorism -- i believe they do represent the mainstream community opinion in a much more significant way than mr tarek and his group""""
mohamed elmasry, president of the canadian islamic congress, called mr fatah's criticisms gratuitous and unwarranted """"there are about  imams in canada and you cannot say that all of them are wrong and the prime minister cannot meet with some of them,"""" he said
there have always been internal tensions in islam, as in other religions, but the recent squabbling exposes serious political rivalries and a struggle for the souls and minds of ordinary muslims while traditional leaders like mr elmasry minimize the spectre of a power struggle, it's clear that new voices are emerging to challenge the existing order
""""there is a fight going on for what it means to be muslim in a secular, post-modern society like canada,"""" says mr fatah
the root cause of the problem lies not just in the history of islam, but also in the way immigrant communities established themselves in canada
unlike other religions, islam is not formally hierarchical and power does not devolve from a high authority to lower echelons there is no pope or archbishop of canterbury whose word or edict is generally accepted as law there isn't even the equivalent of ottawa's archbishop marcel gervais, who speaks with an authority that many local catholics accept the muslim spiritual leader, the imam, speaks only for his congregation
in the greater toronto area, where , -- about  per cent - - of canadian muslims live, there are at least  mosques conservative mosques like imam aly hindy's salaheddin islamic centre live uneasily with liberal ones like the umma, an ahmadi mosque where women can lead prayers imams act and speak independently, as do the many islamic organizations
while the major divide in canada is between the sunni majority (about , people) and shia minority, there are smaller sects like the ismaili and the ahmadi, better known as qadiyani, who originated in pakistan and are considered by some traditionalists not to be real muslims the shia population in canada is said to be about , the ismailis number between , and ,, while ahmadis have about , members
the differences are sometimes exacerbated by ethnic rivalries muslim immigrants to canada came in waves -- south asians from the indian subcontinent, iranians fleeing from the revolution, lebanese fleeing civil war there are africans (many of them somali, also fleeing civil war) recently, there've been bosnians and, to a less extent, kosovars, fleeing serb atrocities
then there are skilled workers from all parts who came for a better life when they arrived, the various immigrant groups found comfort in numbers and tended to stick together the mosques they founded tended to be along ethnic lines the mosques were not just places of worship, but cultural and social centres where ethic and national ties were reinforced
consequently, many mosques and organizations bear the imprint of individual nationalities such as east indian, pakistani, lebanese, turkish, somali, bosnian, iranian, each with a particular identity and agenda as one ethnic group established its own mosque, another was compelled to do the same, if only for reasons of cultural pride
each individual mosque may have been created out of a desire to forge unity and cement an identity, but collectively the mosques have morphed into an instrument of division and controversy
this is not to say that no effort has been made to establish pan- canadian organizations groups such as the islamic forum of canada, the islamic centre of canada, the islamic society of canada, the muslim association of canada, jamia islamia canada, and the canadian society of muslims have names that suggest a national orientation but in reality have little national standing
historically, mr elmasry's canadian islamic congress, which claims to be the country's largest independent muslim organization, has been the most recognized group it is probably the group with the largest national membership and mr elmasry is a constant presence in mosques around the country but some muslim leaders say that the congress's basic weakness is that in the toronto area very few groups are affiliated to it
the muslim association of canada, a largely arab group, says it has  chapters across canada but, even so, the organization has very little profile and its leaders are hardly known
since sept , , the canadian council on american-islamic relations (cair-can) has attracted much attention with its emphasis on human rights founded five years ago, it has a paid staff of five but the number of members is unknown it scored a major coup when it persuaded  imams to sign the declaration against terrorism
it was the council that helped organize the prime minister's meeting with the imams, a role that raised the organization's profile but also provoked some criticism that it was deliberately cozying up with the government in order to supplant the canadian islamic congress as the leading muslim organization another complaint is that the council is essentially an american organization
mr saloojee calls such allegations nonsense
""""i've never thought that there is a rivalry and it would be wrong to try to elbow others out,"""" he says """"there was an opportunity to do something historic with the imams and we did there was an opportunity to meet the prime minister and we did""""
with a membership of only , the secular muslim canadian congress may be the new kid on the block, yet is still managing to attract much media attention religious muslim leaders dismiss him as a publicity hound who represents no one but himself, but mr fatah is equally dismissive of them
""""we may not represent the majority of muslims but we resemble the majority of muslims,"""" he retorts
while the different groups are jostling for national attention, the real power in the canadian muslim community resides in greater toronto, and that power radiates from the many mosques spread around the city among the leading ones are madina, salaheddin, the islamic society of toronto mosque, the international muslim organization mosque, the islamic foundation of toronto mosque and the jami mosque, the oldest in ontario
there are even divisions within divisions the minority shia community, for example, operates several different mosques to cater to the different nationalities the leading one is the toronto jaffari islamic centre, made up largely of east african muslims of indian origin the imam ali centre, also in toronto, houses under one roof separate prayer spaces for iranians, iraqis and pakistanis
the negative impact of so many discordant voices was the driving force behind the establishment in toronto of the coalition of muslim organizations, a body """"to create a united and effective muslim presence in canada""""
made of more than  groups ranging from the very conservative to the very liberal, the coalition pushed for, and received, a recent meeting with public safety minister anne mclellan to discuss the muslim community's relationship with the canadian security intelligence service
muslim leaders agree that this is the best way to serve the community
""""there can never be one voice for canadian muslims the muslim voice has to be a coalition of voices,"""" says mr fatah

what that means is that medicine will be revolutionized while you're still a young person, the mysteries of many, so-far intractable diseases will be unlocked diagnoses will be made earlier and treatments, if not always cures, will be developed
as science learns more about the way cells behave at the molecular level, the onset of many genetic-based killers, including the viperish cluster of cancers, finally will be counteracted therapeutic viruses, via pills or vaccine, will be used to replace damaged genes with healthy ones, and suppress the onset of a disease people may live with cancer as they have with diabetes and this, it reckoned, by 
in short order, you will not even have to wait for a diagnosis
so much will be knowable about your inherited predispositions (your doctor will record your genetic profile on a computer chip), that if you're at risk of a given condition, """"chemo-prevention"""" will be prescribed in advance - in advance of birth, for that matter
ah what price perfectibility?
the capacity to diagnose genetic diseases prenatally will inevitably lead to preventative abortion, rather than treatment, and that a dilemma you will not escape wrangling with one of many
biotechnology is already outstripping our ability to keep moral checks on it, and the pace of seeming progress will quicken even more for you
not just the inner-core workings of the body are about to be revealed new and advanced forms of magnetic-resonance imaging will provide detailed road-maps of the most complex human system of all: the brain
by the time you're an adult, science will know which of the  billion neurons and one trillion interconnections are actually working when you think, speak, read and it will know how to stimulate injured ones to regenerate themselves that the blind will see, the deaf hear and the paralyzed walk again is a virtual certainty before your century ends
long before that, however, sophisticated scanners will be able to distinguish the source in the brain of gender differences and to assess, at an early age, intellectual strengths and weaknesses dyslexia, for example, will be diagnosable in one- or two-year-olds and corrective intervention begun people will be popping """"brain steroids"""" to crank up their thinking processes
schizophrenia, drug and alcohol addiction, and the ever- increasing scourge of depression, will be counteracted with new drugs, as will brain damage caused by stroke or trauma and diseases such as parkinson and alzheimer
thank goodness for that because the latter will be more prevalent than ever in the decades ahead
the baby boomers who dominated the last half of the th century will still be a demographic force in the first three or four decades of yours, with one in four people  or older by 
yes, they'll be costly to look after but be kind it you, not them, who will live on average into your late s, s, and even well beyond - if you decide to make that a priority (small bet: most of you won't) so don't go passing a euthanasia-bill on first reading the boomers are a population blip shortly to disappear from the radar screen
speaking of which, you might as well start hearing the bad news
be aware that canadians, like people in all other western countries, are barely reproducing themselves that is the end result of education, wealth and women liberation - advances not shared by most of the third world there was much hope to the contrary after ww ii, indeed much progress for a decade or two, but in the end, its th century and ours did not keep pace not by a long shot
in , europe had three times the population of africa; by , africa will have three times that of europe and this despite the devastation already wrought on a dozen or more of its states by aids and the return of tuberculosis, this time in drug-resistant form these two diseases alone will work even further havoc in the decades ahead in asia and india
more ominous still is the expected emergence of new and deadly viruses (more than  already have appeared since ) when, where and what they will be is anyone guess, but courtesy of air travel and ever more migrant-refugee ships, these plagues won't be recognizing first world borders
you will learn that north america isn't a fortress whose inhabitants can remain safely oblivious to what going wrong on the rest of the planet
when you are , the population of the earth is predicted to be  billion, half again what it is today the vast majority of births will take place in the developing world, in the countries least able to cope with them, in sprawling urban centres of barely conceivable size, volatile breeding grounds for disease and crime
the united nations projects the population of bombay, for just one example, to be  million by  and a staggering  million by  and there will be  other ultra-megacities in the developing world following close behind in size
even today, more than a billion people in  countries have no access to safe drinking water already, soil depletion and brute poverty mean that millions are chronically malnourished - and this when virtually all the planet arable land is being cultivated
if for no other reason than the us is committed to it, genetically modified food, now the subject of rancorous controversy, will be safeguarded and accepted within the next decade
on its own, this agri-technology could end global food shortages presuming, that is, it is used to increase crop yields in the third world, and not just to grow, oh, ever-white mushrooms for your table in the west
as for water, we're not running out of it, we just haven't managed the supply of it as well as, say, earth oil reserves just like we've failed to manage its depleting forests or the impact of human activity on its climate (the global temperature rose  per cent in the 's) just like we've failed to halt the disappearance of its fish stocks and animal species (some , are lost every year)
we have the know-how to fix these problems, have even done so in a random way here and there but we've lacked the will, or more likely the sense of urgency, to tackle them globally that requires international co-operation and it, as you'll learn, is a tricky business strange though it may seem, solvable problems don't always get solved
as ian burton at the university of toronto institute of environmental studies points out, """"the obstacles to environmental solutions are not technical we know what to do but the obstacles remain because some people have more interest in the status quo than in the future""""
greed and apathy have been a cozy twosome for quite some time now but with any luck, your generation will understand that rational self-interest can mean acting in the planet interest
growth and conservation are not mutually exclusive if you end up becoming a dollar-chaser in life, at least consider resource management as a career or investment opportunity not that anyone has yet figured out how to run a fail-safe global economic system, but that, rest assured, is a cast-iron cinch
in tandem with the rise in the third world population, a drop is foreseen in other areas where births are already declining with no concurrent offset in immigration
what happens when europe, as projected, loses a quarter of its overall population, russia some  million and japan  million round about ? if they are not fully occupying their territories, someone else will, won't they?
canada, or more precisely, toronto, may well end up an international role model for the peaceable (so far at least) integration of myriad races, and ethnic groups, cultures and religions
a decade ago, we thought we would hand you a legacy of peace with the fall of communism, democracy had won and war, as the th century had so devastatingly known it, was over indeed, there were a record number of democratic nations in the world -  out of 
we were premature in our optimism democracy has been no magic bullet it can be so flexibly defined as to be meaningless, so fragile it can disappear overnight according to freedom house, the international state-monitoring agency, only about  or so democracies out of the  are in any real sense """"free""""
as for conflict, the world in the 's saw everything from a high- tech cyber war in the mid-east to ethnic massacres in eastern europe to raw, tribal genocide in east africa more of the same is looming, says martin shadwick, a foreign affairs analyst with york university centre for international and security studies
""""in the foreseeable future, state-to-state war is virtually unthinkable, but there are going to be more civil wars, ethnic conflicts, and internal break-ups that go horribly wrong
""""having said that, a flashpoint for the future is resource scarcity, and with that, who to say state-to-state war won't surface again?""""
the cold war may end up looking like the good old days, he says, only half-facetiously at least back then, everyone knew the lead players, the script and the plot from here on, it improvisation as geographic regions redraw their borders and declare themselves independent nations, new and unpredictable characters will be stomping on and off the world stage
the past is prologue, and shadwick advice to you is to expect the unexpected: """"invitations to disaster will be coming to your mailbox""""
and will you give a damn?
we're not handing over to you, little one, much in the way of a moral compass to be plotting your course with in the west, traditional religious belief has dramatically declined, marriage broken down and the family unit radically changed form our social values are pragmatic and self-serving, often to the extreme
you will be smarter and probably richer than most of us, but will you be any wiser? any happier? or will you be searching, ever more frantically as the decades speed by, for meaning in your existence?
cracking the genetic code will give you more control than we have had over life, death, and the quality of physical existence in- between but solving the enigma of the brain will, like so much else in the st century, be a double-edged sword
what if human consciousness is ultimately revealed as a thing unto itself? what if the inevitable conclusion then is that there no transcendental power hovering beyond the horizon? where will that leave you - adrift in the universe, or in charge of it?
optimists like historian francis fukuyama believe you will create a new spiritual and ethical order to support yourselves, and for one simple reason:
""""human beings are by nature social creatures whose most basic drives lead them to create moral rules that bind them together a high-tech society cannot get along without them and will face considerable incentives to produce them""""
undoubtedly so
but the future is a foreign country; you may do things differently there
so be it
(just remember what we said about the boomers)

This is surprising because the current five-year plan calling for immigration of 1.2 million people represents the world largest wave of newcomers since the turn of the century, except for the special case of Israel. (The foreigners seeking admission to Germany are not immigrants but asylum-seekers, most of whom are expected to leave. But even if it gets 500,000 newcomers this year, Germany intake will still be much lower than Canada on a per capita basis.) * Immigrants form ethnic ghettos and refuse to adopt Canadian cultural values. This is a crude overstatement.

New immigrants have always been """"different""""; succeeding generations have always integrated and it still happening.

Now the symbols are changing and she isn't as comfortable. In her terms, we've changed the rules of game. She says, 'Nobody asked me.' """"","note
the world is on the move
by some estimates, as many as  million people from poor countries want to make new homes in the exclusive club of rich countries, a club that includes canada but the rich countries can't employ or accommodate more than a small fraction of them
heartless as it may seem, the rich countries don't need these people and aren't going to let them in
yet through the s and beyond, an ever-growing tide of people from the poor nations will be pounding on the gates of the rich
four babies are born every second in less than two decades, the third world labor force will contain  million more people than it does today, an increase equal to the existing labor force of all the world industrialized countries
because of television and movies, people who live in the teeming cities of the third world know that a better life awaits them in the rich countries if they can only get through those gates you can't blame them for trying all they want is what the immigrant ancestors of today canadians wanted - a better life for their children
they want it so badly that if one rich country refuses them entry, they will try another one place many will be sure to try is canada
canadian immigration policy used to be about seeking immigrants to populate a new country that was in the process of nation- building it not about that any more, although many people still think of it in these archaic terms
immigration policy today is about finding a way to cope with the swelling tide of humanity that wants in it is in canada best interest to select only a few of the millions of people who would like to come here - the ones most likely to become productive members of canadian society
that is why parliament is debating measures aimed at giving the government more control over who gets in and that is why policy- makers in canada and other rich countries are belatedly waking up to the need to plan third world development aid with the aim of curbing migration by creating jobs in those countries
it is clear that we must buy the goods and services that the poor countries are offering or they will send us their excess populations
this new global setting provides an entirely new context for canadian immigration policy a national debate is long overdue
yet, until recently, there has been little debate over immigration policy in canada this is surprising because the current five-year plan calling for immigration of  million people represents the world largest wave of newcomers since the turn of the century, except for the special case of israel (the foreigners seeking admission to germany are not immigrants but asylum-seekers, most of whom are expected to leave but even if it gets , newcomers this year, germany intake will still be much lower than canada on a per capita basis)
no other country in the world receives immigrants on a scale even close to ours
it hard to have a dispassionate and serious discussion on this vital issue that because, more than any other area of public policy, immigration is encrusted with empty rhetoric, emotionalism, exaggerated claims and quaint, romantic notions that simply don't make any sense
both those who favor canada policy of massive, unselective immigration and those who are against non-white immigration and multiculturalism rely on a variety of myths to bolster their arguments
some of these ideas hark back to canada pioneer days they are worthless as a basis for a modernized immigration policy suitable to the rapidly approaching st century before we can even start to talk about immigration policy in the 's, we need to reassess these outdated ideas
here are a few of them:
* canada can absorb many immigrants because it is so big this is the most widespread, and the most foolish, of all immigration myths it has been more than  years since immigrants came to settle empty land in canada today, all immigrants go to big cities because that is where the jobs are and where other people of similar backgrounds live
* immigration brings in skilled people we need but don't produce ourselves just when industry is desperate for highly skilled workers (and offers fewer opportunities than ever for the unskilled), we find ourselves with an immigration system that, in effect, gives priority to uneducated people immigrants, as of the  census, were three times as likely to be functionally illiterate (ie, have less than grade  education) as native-born canadians yet in , immigrants were three times as likely as those born in canada to have a higher education
* immigration is essential to the economy there is no evidence that this is true in fact, there is a consensus among economists who have studied immigration that it does nothing to raise the incomes of those already here the world three major immigrant- receiving countries - canada, the united states and australia - do not outperform other industrialized countries that traditionally have had little or no immigration
* immigrants cause unemployment and are a drain on social services wrong in the past, immigrants have contributed more to the public coffers in taxes than they have taken out studies have shown time and again that, while immigration may depress wages and cause unemployment in certain industries, it has no permanent impact on the over-all unemployment rate
* canada refugee determination system is the most generous in the world true but, by international standards, it is not really a refugee determination system it is a parallel immigration program in which self-selected immigrants are given landed status as """"refugees"""" although most would not be so defined anywhere else in the world
* canada is under- populated the issue is not whether canada is under-populated but whether metro toronto and other large cities are under-populated because that is where immigrants settle our cities are undergoing unprecedented stress - homelessness, food banks, violent crime, traffic congestion, air pollution, overflowing landfill sites is more population the answer to these problems? few urban residents think so, yet the progressive conservative government relentlessly pursues a policy of high immigration that makes rapid urban growth inevitable
* immigrants form ethnic ghettos and refuse to adopt canadian cultural values this is a crude overstatement governor-general ray hnatyshyn ancestors probably had less in common culturally with the native-born canadians they encountered on arriving from ukraine than do today new arrivals new immigrants have always been """"different""""; succeeding generations have always integrated and it still happening a survey of british columbia high school students in  by charles ungerleider of the university of bc showed that immigrants and their children knew as much about canadian values as defined in the charter of rights as canadian-born students and were equally loyal to those values
* canada requires immigrants to pass a points test to show they have useful skills rarely in fact, fewer than  per cent need to prove any kind of worthiness, compared with  per cent  years ago by encouraging family reunification beyond the immediate family, even before immigrants have obtained citizenship, ottawa has created a stream of self-selected immigrants who don't need to speak one of our languages or have any education or skills to enter canada by right
* immigration is diluting the canadian national identity if canadians have only a frail sense of national identity, that is not the fault of immigrants most new canadians are ready and willing to accept the canadian identity as their own but first we have to articulate clearly, both for their sake and our own, what that identity is
* because of our low fertility rate, canada population is shrinking and we need more immigrants to fill jobs wrong because we have so many women of child-bearing age, our population would be growing even without any immigration canada, according to the most recent statistics canada demographic report, has """"the strongest rate of population growth in the industrialized world"""" our fertility rate of  children per woman is among the highest in the western world (by comparison, italy and spain have the lowest fertility in the world at  children per woman) meanwhile, canada unemployment rate is stuck at a lofty  per cent, a figure that does not include people who have dropped out of the labor force
* if we don't have a lot of immigration, our population will go down eventually because canadians aren't producing enough babies to replace the existing population of  million this is true, but what does it really mean? it means that because a couple now in their s decide to have only one child, the canadian population will eventually decline by one but that decline won't likely happen for at least another  years when the mother and father die in an over-populated world, there are far more pressing things to worry about than that anyway, no one can prove that a canada of  million people in the middle of the next century would be worse off than a canada of  million,  million or  million the environment would benefit from a smaller population and, because we would be forced to invest more in training and technology, our economy would become more competitive
* without high immigration there won't be enough young people to pay for the social programs to support all the old people we are going to have as society ages this is most unlikely european countries already have the high percentage of older people that we will have in the next century and they are doing fine """"even with ordinary increases in productivity the whole question of supporting an aging population just disappears,"""" says mike murphy, who headed the federal government review of canada demographic future
* a tidal wave of people is on the move and you can't stop a tidal wave yes you can, if you decide you really want to italy sent back boatloads of albanians and the albanians stopped coming when the west said it would no longer accept vietnamese refugees and proved it by forcibly repatriating them from camps in hong kong, the boat people stopped coming the fatalistic notion that countries can't prevent mass influxes of unwanted migrants is unsupported by any evidence
once we've dispensed with the mythology, what are we left with? well, we're left with , people a year leaving crowded cities in other countries to come to crowded cities in canada we know why they want to come: most will enjoy a better standard of living and a lot of them have relatives here
furthermore, in canada they can live in peace, get enough to eat, and vote in free elections, which is a better deal than most countries are offering these days
but immigration is supposed to be a balance between the needs of the people who want to come and those of the people who already live here so what in it for us? why do we want to cram so many new people, half of whom can't speak either official language, into our largest cities every year?
that is a difficult and complex question i know because i have been asking it for the past year it was a year devoted to investigating immigration policy - conducting scores of interviews in canada and the us as well as in mexico city, brussels and geneva, and examining countless reports and studies
defenders of the existing policy argue that rapid population growth is essential for economic growth by this analysis, the citizens of china and india should be the richest people on earth while those who live in small countries with stable populations - switzerland and the netherlands, for example - should have starved to death long ago
the truth is that immigration helps some canadians economically, hurts others and makes little difference to the vast majority it time for a more realistic assessment of what immigration can do, both for canada and for the people who want to settle here
immigration is a way of:
* providing a haven for genuine refugees
* getting some capital and useful skills, while keeping in mind that these benefits, though helpful, have no great economic impact
* reuniting immediate families, that is, spouses and dependent children
* preventing too steep a drop in population
finally, there is an intangible but vitally important reason why canada receives immigrants: because it is a nation of immigrants canada was built by immigrants and all of us, except for aboriginals, are either immigrants or descendants of immigrants recharging our batteries with a flow of new arrivals is an essential perhaps the essential element of our national character
in this, says doris meissner, an expert on immigration at the carnegie foundation in washington, canadians, australians and americans differ fundamentally from europeans for whom """"membership in society is tied to ethnicity and nationality""""
in the immigrant-receiving countries, ethnic diversity is seen as a good thing and membership in society is based not on ethnicity but on a shared commitment to democratic values
we should stop looking at immigration as an economic panacea; it isn't nor should we view immigration as a demographic necessity; there will be no demographic disaster if we have much less of it instead, we should celebrate immigration as a reaffirmation of who we are - a nation of immigrants
but we should be clear about how immigration is changing the country: who we are, and who we are becoming, is different from who we were
until the s, immigration policy in canada, the us and australia systematically excluded visible minorities then all three immigrant-receiving countries, with canada leading the way, traded in their racist policies for egalitarian ones the implications of that decision were not debated then and, in canada, they still haven't been
the implications are these: the vast majority of the immigrants to canada now are non-white this fact, coupled with a low birth rate and the concentration of immigrants in the largest cities, means that non-whites will eventually become the majority in these cities
when the politicians quietly changed the policy a quarter of a century ago, nobody thought this would happen
in both canada and the us, politicians actually thought they could have a non-racist immigration policy without changing the ethnic makeup of their respective countries most immigration to north america had always been from europe and that was the way it would always be, or so they thought in the third world, said nicholas katzenbach, who was us attorney-general at the time, """"there are not many people who want to come""""
the thinking in ottawa was the same, recalls orest kruhlak, a political scientist with a special interest in immigration and head of ottawa multiculturalism program in vancouver """"the bureaucrats and politicians thought that immigrants would still come from europe,"""" he says
kruhlak, who is of ukrainian background, thinks few canadians are racist but he thinks many are like his mother-in-law
like her, they observe our society changing because of non- european immigration and they feel """"a sense of uncomfortableness, a sense of unease my mother-in-law is -years-old, was born and raised in alberta, and is of british and swedish origin she used to know the signposts of life she didn't have to have an explanation now the symbols are changing and she isn't as comfortable in her terms, we've changed the rules of game she says, 'nobody asked me' """"
when the rules were changed, only  per cent of toronto population was made up of visible minorities today, they are  per cent and by , they will be  per cent
meanwhile, an angus reid poll last june found that  per cent of canadians think racism is a serious and escalating problem and  per cent of torontonians expect more rioting like last spring rampage on yonge st following the police shooting of a black man
even members of minority groups are less comfortable in canada than they were before brian mulroney government decided we needed a huge influx of newcomers a poll by goldfarb consultants this year found that only  per cent of minority group members were """"very satisfied"""" with life in canada compared with  per cent in  as well,  per cent felt prejudice against them was increasing compared with  per cent in 
change is always stressful, especially rapid change canadians will have to accept that, in an increasingly multicultural world, the ethnic composition of canada will change but, not unreasonably, they prefer gradual to rapid change that is why opinion polls consistently show strong support for lower immigration levels
canada three major parties have decided that this majority view should not be permitted to have political expression immigration policy in canada is conducted as if it were none of the public business
instead, it is the preserve of advocacy groups, ethnic communities, politicians representing those communities, and lawyers whose livelihood depends on having a large supply of immigrants to represent
these people form a sort of immigration establishment and they resent the idea that immigration policy should reflect the national interest instead, they insist that it conform to the wishes of prospective immigrants and their canadian relatives and because most new immigrants are non-white, advocates of lower, more selective immigration risk being accused of racism
it is the same in sweden, says jonas widgren, a former swedish secretary of state for immigration he now heads the informal consultations, a geneva- based organization that provides a forum for the  developed countries that are the most frequent destinations of asylum-seekers
""""in sweden you have to hate racism,"""" he says """"so you can't even discuss immigration because that is being racist""""
this situation allows the terms of the debate to be set by the far right, which is unafraid of being called racist, and creates a political vacuum on a crucial public policy issue
we should not smugly assume that canada is immune to the sort of anti- immigrant backlash now underway in europe it could happen here if the pace of immigration continues to outstrip the country ability to absorb newcomers
the government proposed changes are a welcome beginning at restoring an element of national interest to immigration policy but they are only a first step
the government still hasn't got around to explaining why canada needs the biggest per capita immigration intake in the world and, intellectually, it hasn't caught up to our commonwealth cousins in australia, who have accepted the fact that immigration impact on the economy is neutral our policy is still based on exaggerated claims of its ability to boost prosperity
we might be better off if we scaled down both the size of the immigration program and our expectations of what it can do for us most of all, we need to discard the mythology, drop the name- calling, and have a real debate on how to shape an immigration policy for the st century
